  "{{short description|Binary relation such that if A is related to B and is different from it then B is not related to A}} \n {{Refimprove|date=January 2010}} \n {{stack|{{Binary relations}}}} \n \n In [[mathematics]], a [[binary relation|relation]] ''R'' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' is '''antisymmetric''' if there is no pair of ''distinct'' elements of ''X'' each of which is related by ''R'' to the other. More formally, ''R'' is antisymmetric precisely if for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X'' \n :if ''R''(''a'', ''b'') with ''a'' & nbsp;\u2260 & nbsp;''b'', then ''R''(''b'', ''a'') must not hold, \n or, equivalently, \n :if ''R''(''a'', ''b'') and ''R''(''b'', ''a''), then ''a'' & nbsp;= & nbsp;''b''. \n (The definition of antisymmetry says nothing about whether ''R''(''a'', ''a'') actually holds or not for any ''a''.) \n \n ==Examples== \n The [[divisibility]] relation on the [[natural number]]s is an important example of an antisymmetric relation. In this context, antisymmetry means that the only way each of two numbers can be divisible by the other is if the two are, in fact, the same number; equivalently, if ''n'' and ''m'' are distinct and ''n'' is a factor of ''m'', then ''m'' cannot be a factor of ''n''.  For example,  12 is divisible by 4, but 4 is not divisible by 12. \n \n The usual [[order relation]] \u2264 on the [[real number]]s is antisymmetric: if for two real numbers ''x'' and ''y'' both [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] ''x'' & nbsp;\u2264 & nbsp;''y'' and ''y'' & nbsp;\u2264 & nbsp;''x'' hold then ''x'' and ''y'' must be equal. Similarly,  the [[subset order]] \u2286 on the subsets of any given set is antisymmetric: given two sets ''A'' and ''B'', if every [[Element (mathematics)|element]] in ''A'' also is in ''B'' and every element in ''B'' is also in ''A'', then ''A'' and ''B'' must contain all the same elements and therefore be equal: \n : < math > A \\subseteq B \\land B \\subseteq A \\Rightarrow A = B < /math > \n A real-life example of a relation that is typically antisymmetric is  \" paid the restaurant bill of \"  (understood as restricted to a given occasion). Typically some people pay their own bills, while others pay for their spouses or friends. As long as no two people pay each other's bills, the relation is antisymmetric. \n \n ==Properties== \n [[partial order|Partial]] and [[total order]]s are antisymmetric by definition. A relation can be both [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] and antisymmetric (in this case, it must be [[coreflexive relation|coreflexive]]), and there are relations which are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric (e.g., the  \" preys on \"  relation on biological [[species]]). \n \n Antisymmetry is different from [[Asymmetric relation|asymmetry]]: a relation is asymmetric if, and only if, it is antisymmetric and [[irreflexive]]. \n \n == See also == \n \n * {{annotated link|Reflexive relation}} \n * {{annotated link|Symmetry in mathematics}} \n \n ==References== \n *{{MathWorld | urlname=AntisymmetricRelation | title=Antisymmetric Relation}} \n *{{cite book |title=Theory and Problems of Discrete Mathematics |url=https://archive.org/details/schaumsoutlinedi00lips_585 |url-access=limited |first=Seymour |last=Lipschutz |author-link=Seymour Lipschutz |author2=Marc Lars Lipson |year=1997 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-038045-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/schaumsoutlinedi00lips_585/page/n39 33]}} \n *[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/antisymmetric+relation nLab antisymmetric relation] \n \n {{DEFAULTSORT:Antisymmetric Relation}} \n [[Category:Binary relations]]"
