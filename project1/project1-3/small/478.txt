Ames is the only town in Iowa with a population of greater than 50,000 that does not have a state highway serving it. {{As of|2019}}, Ames currently has three roundabouts constructed on University Avenue/530th Avenue. The first is at the intersection of Airport Road (Oakwood Rd.) and University Avenue, the second at the intersection of Cottonwood Road and 530th Avenue and the third at Collaboration Place and 530th Avenue. \n \n Ames was serviced by the Fort Dodge, Des Moines and Southern Railroad via a branch from [[Kelley, Iowa|Kelley]] to [[Iowa State University|Iowa State]] and to downtown Ames. The tracks were removed in the 1960s. The [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company]] twin mainline runs east and west bisecting the town and running just south of the downtown business district. The C & NW used to operate a branch to [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]. This line was removed in the 1980s when the Spine Line through the nearby city of [[Nevada, Iowa|Nevada]] was purchased from the [[Rock Island Railroad]] after its bankruptcy. The [[Union Pacific]], successor to the C & NW, still runs 60\u201370 trains a day through Ames on twin mainlines, which leads to some traffic delays. There is also a branch to [[Eagle Grove, Iowa|Eagle Grove]] that leaves Ames to the north. The Union Pacific maintains a small yard called Ames Yard east of Ames between Ames and Nevada. Ames has been testing automatic train horns at several of its crossings. These directional horns which are focused down the streets are activated when the crossing signals turn on and are shut off after the train crosses the crossing. This system cancels out the need for the trains to blow their horns. Train noise had been a problem in the residential areas to the west and northwest of downtown. \n \n [[Ames Municipal Airport]] is located {{convert|1|mi|km}} southeast of the city. The current (and only) [[fixed-base operator]] is Hap's Air Service, a company which has been based at the airport since 1975. The airport has two runways \u2013 01/19, which is {{convert|5700|x|100|ft}}, and 13/31, which is {{convert|3492|x|100|ft}}. \n \n The City of Ames offers a transit system throughout town, called [[CyRide]], that is funded jointly by Iowa State University, the ISU Government of the Student Body, and the City of Ames. Rider fares are subsidized through this funding, and are free for children under five. Students pay a set cost as part of their tuition. \n \n In 2009, the Ames metropolitan statistical area (MSA) ranked as the third highest in the United States for percentage of commuters who walked to work (10.4 percent). < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acs-15.pdf|series=American Community Survey Reports|title=Commuting in the United States: 2009|access-date=December 26, 2017|date=September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170726134351/https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acs-15.pdf|archive-date=July 26, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}} < /ref > \n \n Ames has the headquarters of the [[Iowa Department of Transportation]]. < ref > \" [http://www.iowadot.gov/where.htm Where We Are Located] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728084104/http://www.iowadot.gov/where.htm |date=July 28, 2009 }}. \"  [[Iowa Department of Transportation]].

Iowa is the first caucus state and Ames is a [[college town]]. It is the site of many political appearances, debates and events, especially during election years. \n \n From 1979 through 2011, Ames was the location of the [[Ames Straw Poll]], which was held every August prior to a presidential election year in which the Republican presidential nomination was undecided (meaning there was no Republican president running for re-election\u2014as in 2011, 2007, 1999, 1995, 1987, and 1979). The poll would gauge support for the various Republican candidates amongst attendees of a [[fundraising]] dinner benefiting the [[Republican Party of Iowa|Iowa Republican Party]]. The straw poll was frequently seen by national media and party insiders as a first test of organizational strength in Iowa. < ref > {{cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/08/14/iowa.saturday.02/|title=Iowa Saturday|publisher=CNN|date=August 14, 1999}} < /ref >  In 2015, the straw poll was to be moved to nearby Boone before the Iowa Republican Party eventually decided to cancel it altogether. < ref > {{cite news|url = http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/06/12/iowa-straw-poll/71116276/|title=The Iowa Straw Poll is dead|publisher=The Des Moines Register|date=June 12, 2015}} < /ref > \n \n == See also == \n {{Portal|Iowa}} \n * [[Ames process]] \n * [[North Grand Mall]] \n * [[Reiman Gardens]] \n \n == References == \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n \n == External links == \n {{Commons category|Ames, Iowa}} \n {{wikivoyage|Ames}} \n *[http://www.cityofames.org/ Official Ames City Website] \n * [http://www.amescampustown.com/ Ames Campustown official site] \n *[https://web.archive.org/web/20060210213426/http://www.mainstreetculturaldistrict.com/ The Main Street Cultural District] \n *[http://www.city-data.com/city/Ames-Iowa.html City Data] Detailed Statistical Data and more about Ames \n \n < br/ > < !--this break is to put visual space between links and the following template-- > \n {{Story County, Iowa}} \n \n {{authority control}} \n \n [[Category:Ames, Iowa| ]] \n [[Category:Cities in Iowa]] \n [[Category:Cities in Story County, Iowa]] \n [[Category:University towns in the United States]] \n [[Category:Populated places established in 1864]] \n [[Category:1864 establishments in Iowa]]"
