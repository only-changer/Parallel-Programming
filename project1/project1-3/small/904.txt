During the leadership of First Secretary Heydar Aliyev, there was a revival in the veteran movement, during which the committee gradually expanded to the republic. The establishment of the Republican Veterans Organization took place on 21 March 1987. Despite the official registration of the RVO with the Ministry of Justice, the activity of the organization was largely formal due to the tensions in the country with the Karabakh War, as well as the attitude of the government towards Red Army veterans in general. One of the first laws signed by the President Aliyev was the Law  \" On Veterans \"  (28 June 1994), which restored the mandate for the RVO. < ref > {{Cite web|title=http://veteran.gov.az/ - History of organization|url=http://veteran.gov.az/en/pages/T%C9%99%C5%9Fkilatin%20tarixi/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200712083925/http://veteran.gov.az/en/pages/T%C9%99%C5%9Fkilatin%20tarixi/|archive-date=12 July 2020|access-date=2020-12-13|website=veteran.gov.az}} < /ref > \n \n ==See also== \n *[[Azerbaijan Voluntary Military Patriotism Technical Sport Society]] \n *[[Judiciary of Azerbaijan]] \n *[[Special Purpose Police Unit]] \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist}} \n * {{CIA World Factbook}} \n * {{StateDept}} \n \n ==Further reading== \n *U.S. Army War College Center for Strategic Leadership, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100401042756/http://www.csl.army.mil/usacsl/publications/IP%2011-08%20-%20Azerbaijan.pdf Transformation of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces], October 2008 \n \n ==External links== \n {{Commons category|Military of Azerbaijan}} \n * [https://www.youtube.com/user/WarrioRDFB Official YouTube Channel of Azerbaijani Soldier program] \n \n {{Azerbaijani Armed Forces}} \n {{Military of Asia}} \n {{Military of Europe}} \n {{Azerbaijan topics}} \n \n [[Category:Azerbaijani Armed Forces| ]] \n [[Category:1918 establishments in Azerbaijan]]"
