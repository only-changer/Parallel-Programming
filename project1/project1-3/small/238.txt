While bi-hemispherical [[reflectance]] is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages. \n \n Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Henderson-Sellers |first1=A. |last2=Wilson |first2=M.

This spectrum includes [[visible spectrum|visible light]] (0.4\u20130.7 \u03bcm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation). \n \n Albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and environmental management (e.g., as part of the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings).

As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g., < ref name= \" NASA \" / > ). These calculations are based on the [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo. \n \n Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about 15 & nbsp;\u00b0C. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below \u221240 & nbsp;\u00b0C. < ref name= \" washington \"  / >  If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 & nbsp;\u00b0C. < ref name= \" clim-past \" / >  In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water \u2013 a so-called [[ocean planet]] \u2013 the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27 & nbsp;\u00b0C. < ref name= \" Smith Robin \" / > \n \n ===White-sky, black-sky, and blue-sky albedo=== \n For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular [[solar zenith angle]] ''\u03b8'' < sub > ''i'' < /sub >  can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: \n * the [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] at that solar zenith angle,  < math > {\\bar \\alpha(\\theta_i)} < /math > , sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo, and \n * the [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]],  < math > \\bar{ \\bar \\alpha} < /math > , sometimes referred to as white-sky albedo. \n with  < math > {1-D} < /math >  being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and  < math > {D} < /math >  being the proportion of diffuse illumination, the actual albedo  < math > {\\alpha} < /math >  (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as: \n \n : < math > {\\alpha}= (1-D) \\bar \\alpha(\\theta_i) + D \\bar{ \\bar \\alpha}. < /math > \n \n This formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface. < ref name= \" BlueskyAlbedo \" / > \n \n == Astronomical albedo == \n \n The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]] and [[minor planet]]s such as [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ( \" phase angle \" ), and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s. \n \n [[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.99.

[[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rainforest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} \n \n Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the [[Earth]]. This has been a concern since arctic ice and [[snow]] has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This [[Ice\u2013albedo feedback|feedback loop]] results in a reduced albedo effect. < ref > {{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21721364-commercial-opportunities-are-vastly-outweighed-damage-climate-thawing-arctic|title=The thawing Arctic threatens an environmental catastrophe|journal=The Economist|access-date=8 May 2017|date=29 April 2017}} < /ref > \n \n ===Climate and weather=== \n Albedo affects [[climate]] by determining how much [[radiation]] a planet absorbs. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=av7q4N8Ib6sC & pg=PA53|title=Encyclopedia of Climate and Weather: Abs-Ero|last1=Schneider|first1=Stephen Henry|last2=Mastrandrea|first2=Michael D.|last3=Root|first3=Terry L.|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-976532-4|page=53}} < /ref >  The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive [[weather]]. \n \n ===Albedo\u2013temperature feedback=== \n When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow\u2013temperature [[feedback]] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow\u2013temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass, soil, or ocean, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating. \n \n ===Snow=== \n Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow. < ref > Hall, D.K. and Martinec, J. (1985), ''Remote sensing of ice and snow''. Chapman and Hall, New York, 189 pp. < /ref >  Over [[Antarctica]] snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice\u2013albedo [[positive feedback]]). \n \n Just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback. < ref > \" All About Sea Ice. \"  National Snow and Ice Data Center. Accessed 16 November 2017. /cryosphere/seaice/index.html. < /ref >  Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for [[global warming]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} \n \n [[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets. < ref name =  \" Nat.

They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming. < ref name= \" Betts \"  / > \n \n ===Water=== \n [[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20 & nbsp;\u00b0C (refractive index=1.333)]] \n Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]]. \n \n At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle. < ref name= \" Fresnel \"  / > \n \n Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light. \n \n Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection. \n Snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} \n \n ===Clouds=== \n [[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures.
