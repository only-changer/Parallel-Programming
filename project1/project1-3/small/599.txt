The Ottomans made the city the capital first of the [[Anatolia Eyalet]] (1393\u2013late 15th century), and then the [[Angora Vilayet]] (1867\u20131922). The historical center of Ankara is a rocky hill rising {{convert|150|sp=us|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} over the left bank of the [[Ankara River]], a tributary of the [[Sakarya River]]. The hill remains crowned by the ruins of [[Ankara Castle]].

The [[Government of Turkey|government]] is a prominent employer, but Ankara is also an important commercial and industrial city, located at the center of Turkey's road and railway networks. The city gave its name to the [[Angora wool]] shorn from [[Angora rabbit]]s, the long-haired [[Angora goat]] (the source of [[mohair]]), and the [[Turkish Angora|Angora cat]]. The area is also known for its pears, honey and [[muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]] grapes.

It is considered the symbol of the city still today.]] \n \n The oldest settlements in and around the city center of Ankara belonged to the [[Hattians|Hattic]] [[Hattic language|civilization]] which existed during the [[Bronze Age]] and was gradually absorbed c. 2000 \u2013 1700 & nbsp;BC by the [[Hittite language|Indo-European]] [[Hittites]]. The city grew significantly in size and importance under the [[Phrygia]]ns starting around 1000 & nbsp;BC, and experienced a large expansion following the mass migration from [[Gordium|Gordion]], (the capital of [[Phrygia]]), after an earthquake which severely damaged that city around that time. In Phrygian tradition, King [[Midas]] was venerated as the founder of Ancyra, but [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions that the city was actually far older, which accords with present archeological knowledge. < ref > [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece, 1.4.1.,  \" Ancyra was actually older even than that. \" '' < /ref > \n \n Phrygian rule was succeeded first by [[Lydia]]n and later by [[Iran|Persia]]n rule, though the strongly Phrygian character of the peasantry remained, as evidenced by the gravestones of the much later Roman period. Persian sovereignty lasted until the Persians' defeat at the hands of [[Alexander the Great]] who conquered the city in 333 & nbsp;BC. Alexander came from [[Gordium|Gordion]] to Ankara and stayed in the city for a short period. After his death at [[Babylon]] in 323 & nbsp;BC and the subsequent division of his empire among his generals, Ankara, and its environs fell into the share of [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]]. \n \n Another important expansion took place under the [[Pontic Greeks|Greeks]] of [[Pontus (region)|Pontos]] who came there around 300 & nbsp;BC and developed the city as a trading center for the commerce of goods between the [[Black Sea]] ports and Crimea to the north; Assyria, Cyprus, and Lebanon to the south; and Georgia, Armenia and Persia to the east. By that time the city also took its name \u1f0c\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1 (''\u00c1nkyra'', meaning ''[[anchor]]'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) which, in slightly modified form, provides the modern name of ''Ankara''. \n \n ===Celtic history=== \n [[File:Dying gaul.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Dying Galatian]]'' was a famous statue commissioned some time between 230 and 220 & nbsp;BC by King [[Attalus I|Attalos I]] of [[Pergamon]] to honor his victory over the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Galatia]]ns in [[Anatolia]]. Roman marble copy of a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] work of the late 3rd century BC, at the [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome.]] \n \n In 278 & nbsp;BC, the city, along with the rest of central Anatolia, was occupied by a [[Celts|Celt]]ic group, the [[Galatia]]ns, who were the first to make Ankara one of their main tribal centers, the headquarters of the [[Tectosages]] tribe. < ref > [[Livy]], xxxviii. 16 < /ref >  Other centers were [[Pessinus]], today's Ball\u0131hisar, for the [[Trocmi]] tribe, and [[Tavium]], to the east of Ankara, for the [[Tolistobogii]] tribe. The city was then known as ''Ancyra''. The Celtic element was probably relatively small in numbers; a warrior aristocracy which ruled over [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]]-speaking peasants. However, the [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] continued to be spoken in Galatia for many centuries. At the end of the 4th century, [[Jerome|St. Jerome]], a native of Dalmatia, observed that the language spoken around Ankara was very similar to that being spoken in the northwest of the Roman world near [[Trier]]. \n \n ===Roman history=== \n [[File:Galatia Map.png|thumb|left|Ancyra was the capital of the [[Celts|Celt]]ic kingdom of [[Galatia]], and later of the [[Roman province]] with the same name, after its conquest by [[Augustus]] in 25 & nbsp;BC.]] \n [[File:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations116.jpg|thumb|left|Marble head of a Roman woman on display at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], Ankara.]] \n \n The city was subsequently passed under the control of the [[Roman Empire]].

The ruins of Ancyra still furnish today valuable [[relief|bas-relief]]s, inscriptions and other architectural fragments. Two other Galatian tribal centers, [[Tavium]] near [[Yozgat]], and [[Pessinus]] (Balhisar) to the west, near Sivrihisar, continued to be reasonably important settlements in the Roman period, but it was Ancyra that grew into a grand metropolis. \n \n [[File:Res Gestae.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' is the self-laudatory autobiography completed in 13 & nbsp;AD, just before his death, by the first [[Roman emperor]] [[Augustus]]. Most of the text is preserved on the walls of the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]].]] \n [[File:Ankara Thermen05.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman Baths of Ankara]] were constructed by the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] (212\u2013217) in honor of [[Asclepios]], the God of Medicine, and built around three principal rooms: the ''[[caldarium]]'' (hot bath), the ''[[tepidarium]]'' (warm bath) and the ''[[frigidarium]]'' (cold bath) in a typically laid-out {{convert|80|x|120|m|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} classical complex.]] \n \n An estimated 200,000 people lived in Ancyra in good times during the Roman Empire, a far greater number than was to be the case from after the fall of the Roman Empire until the early 20th century. The small [[Ankara River]] ran through the center of the Roman town. It has now been covered and diverted, but it formed the northern boundary of the old town during the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman periods. \u00c7ankaya, the rim of the majestic hill to the south of the present city center, stood well outside the Roman city, but may have been a summer resort. In the 19th century, the remains of at least one [[Roman villa]] or large house were still standing not far from where the \u00c7ankaya Presidential Residence stands today. To the west, the Roman city extended until the area of the Gen\u00e7lik Park and Railway Station, while on the southern side of the hill, it may have extended downwards as far as the site presently occupied by [[Hacettepe University]]. It was thus a sizeable city by any standards and much larger than the Roman towns of [[Gaul]] or [[Britannia]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} \n \n Ancyra's importance rested on the fact that it was the junction point where the roads in northern Anatolia running north\u2013south and east\u2013west intersected, giving it major strategic importance for Rome's eastern frontier. < ref name= \" TIB \" / >  The great imperial road running east passed through Ankara and a succession of emperors and their armies came this way. They were not the only ones to use the Roman highway network, which was equally convenient for invaders. In the second half of the 3rd century, Ancyra was invaded in rapid succession by the [[Goths]] coming from the west (who rode far into the heart of [[Cappadocia]], taking slaves and pillaging) and later by the [[Arab people|Arab]]s. For about a decade, the town was one of the western outposts of one of Palmyrean empress [[Zenobia]] in the [[Syrian Desert]], who took advantage of a period of weakness and disorder in the Roman Empire to set up a short-lived state of her own. \n \n The town was reincorporated into the Roman Empire under Emperor [[Aurelian]] in 272. The [[tetrarchy]], a system of multiple (up to four) emperors introduced by [[Diocletian]] (284\u2013305), seems to have engaged in a substantial program of rebuilding and of road construction from Ankara westwards to Germe and [[Dorylaeum]] (now [[Eski\u015fehir]]). \n \n In its heyday, Roman Ankara was a large market and trading center but it also functioned as a major administrative capital, where a high official ruled from the city's Praetorium, a large administrative palace or office. During the 3rd century, life in Ancyra, as in other Anatolian towns, seems to have become somewhat militarized in response to the invasions and instability of the town. \n \n ===Byzantine history=== \n The city is well known during the 4th century as a center of Christian activity (see also [[#Ecclesiastical history|below]]), due to frequent imperial visits, and through the letters of the pagan scholar [[Libanius]]. < ref name= \" TIB \" / >  Bishop [[Marcellus of Ancyra]] and [[Basil of Ancyra]] were active in the theological controversies of their day, and the city was the site of no less than three church synods in [[Synod of Ancyra|314]], 358 and 375, the latter two in favor of [[Arianism]]. < ref name= \" TIB \" / > \n \n [[File:AnkaraColumnFar c.JPG|thumb|left|The ''Column of Julian'' (362) was erected in honor of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]'s visit to Ancyra.|281x281px]] \n \n The city was visited by Emperor [[Constans I]] (r. 337\u2013350) in 347 and 350, [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] (r. 361\u2013363) during his Persian campaign in 362, and Julian's successor [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]] (r. 363\u2013364) in winter 363/364 (he entered his [[Roman consul|consulship]] while in the city). After Jovian's death soon after, [[Valentinian I]] (r. 364\u2013375) was acclaimed emperor at Ancyra, and in the next year his brother [[Valens]] (r. 364\u2013378) used Ancyra as his base against the usurper [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]]. < ref name= \" TIB \" / >  When the province of Galatia was divided sometime in 396/99, Ancyra remained the civil capital of Galatia I, as well as its ecclesiastical center ([[metropolitan see]]). < ref name= \" TIB \" / >  Emperor [[Arcadius]] (r. 383\u2013408) frequently used the city as his summer residence, and some information about the ecclesiastical affairs of the city during the early 5th century is found in the works of [[Palladius of Galatia]] and Nilus of Galatia. < ref name= \" TIB \" / > \n \n In 479, the rebel [[Marcian (usurper)|Marcian]] attacked the city, without being able to capture it. < ref name= \" TIB \" / >  In 610/11, [[Comentiolus (brother of Phocas)|Comentiolus]], brother of Emperor [[Phocas]] (r. 602\u2013610), launched his own unsuccessful rebellion in the city against [[Heraclius]] (r. 610\u2013641). < ref name= \" TIB \" / >  Ten years later, in 620 or more likely 622, it was captured by the [[Sassanid Persia]]ns during the [[Byzantine\u2013Sassanid War of 602\u2013628]]. Although the city returned to Byzantine hands after the end of the war, the Persian presence left traces in the city's archeology, and likely began the process of its transformation from a [[late antique]] city to a medieval fortified settlement. < ref name= \" TIB \" / > \n \n In 654, the city was captured for the first time by the [[Arabs]] of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], under [[Muawiyah]], the future founder of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. < ref name= \" TIB \" / >  At about the same time, the [[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]]s were established in Anatolia, and Ancyra became capital of the [[Opsician Theme]], which was the largest and most important theme until it was split up under Emperor [[Constantine V]] (r. 741\u2013775); Ancyra then became the capital of the new [[Bucellarian Theme]]. < ref name= \" TIB \" / >  The city was captured at least temporarily by the Umayyad prince [[Maslama ibn Hisham]] in 739/40, the last of the Umayyads' territorial gains from the Byzantine Empire. < ref > {{The End of the Jihad State |page=169}} < /ref >  Ancyra was attacked without success by [[Abbasid]] forces in 776 and in 798/99. In 805, Emperor [[Nikephoros I]] (r. 802\u2013811) strengthened its fortifications, a fact which probably saved it from sack during the [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (806)|large-scale invasion]] of Anatolia by Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] in the next year. < ref name= \" TIB \" / >  Arab sources report that Harun and his successor [[al-Ma'mun]] (r. 813\u2013833) took the city, but this information is later invention. In 838, however, during the [[Sack of Amorium|Amorium campaign]], the armies of Caliph [[al-Mu'tasim]] (r. 833\u2013842) converged and met at the city; abandoned by its inhabitants, Ancara was razed to the ground, before the Arab armies went on to besiege and destroy [[Amorium]]. < ref name= \" TIB \" / >  In 859, Emperor [[Michael III]] (r. 842\u2013867) came to the city during a campaign against the Arabs, and ordered its fortifications restored. < ref name= \" TIB \" / >  In 872, the city was menaced, but not taken, by the [[Paulicians]] under [[Chrysocheir]]. < ref name= \" TIB \" / >  The last Arab raid to reach the city was undertaken in 931, by the Abbasid governor of [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], [[Thamal al-Dulafi]], but the city again was not captured. < ref name= \" TIB \" / > \n \n === Ecclesiastical history === \n [[File:Teodot Ankirski.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Theodotus of Ancyra (martyr)|St. Theodotus of Ancyra]]]] \n \n Early Christian martyrs of Ancyra, about whom little is known, included Proklos and Hilarios who were natives of the otherwise unknown nearby village of Kallippi, and suffered repression under the emperor [[Trajan]] (98\u2013117). In the 280s we hear of Philumenos, a Christian corn merchant from southern Anatolia, being captured and martyred in Ankara, and Eustathius. \n \n As in other Roman towns, the reign of [[Diocletian]] marked the culmination of the persecution of the Christians. In 303, Ancyra was one of the towns where the co-emperors Diocletian and his deputy [[Galerius]] launched their anti-Christian persecution. In Ancyra, their first target was the 38-year-old Bishop of the town, whose name was Clement. Clement's life describes how he was taken to Rome, then sent back, and forced to undergo many interrogations and hardship before he, and his brother, and various companions were put to death. The remains of the church of [[Clement of Ancyra|St. Clement]] can be found today in a building just off I\u015f\u0131klar Caddesi in the Ulus district. Quite possibly this marks the site where Clement was originally buried. Four years later, a doctor of the town named Plato and his brother Antiochus also became celebrated martyrs under Galerius. [[Theodotus of Ancyra (martyr)|Theodotus of Ancyra]] is also venerated as a saint. \n \n However, the persecution proved unsuccessful and in 314 Ancyra was the center of [[Synod of Ancyra|an important council]] of the [[Early Christianity|early church]];{{sfn|Rockwell|1911}} its 25 disciplinary canons constitute one of the most important documents in the early history of the administration of the [[Confession (religion)|Sacrament of Penance]]. {{sfn|Rockwell|1911}} The synod also considered ecclesiastical policy for the reconstruction of the [[Christian Church]] after the persecutions, and in particular the treatment of ''[[Lapsi (Christianity)|lapsi]]''\u2014Christians who had given in to forced [[paganism]] (sacrifices) to avoid [[martyrdom]] during these persecutions.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911}} \n \n Though paganism was probably tottering in Ancyra in Clement's day, it may still have been the majority religion. Twenty years later, Christianity and [[monotheism]] had taken its place. Ancyra quickly turned into a Christian city, with a life dominated by monks and priests and theological disputes. The town council or senate gave way to the bishop as the main local figurehead. During the middle of the 4th century, Ancyra was involved in the complex theological disputes over the nature of Christ, and a form of [[Arianism]] seems to have originated there.{{sfn|Parvis|2006|pp=325\u2013345}} \n \n In 362\u2013363, Emperor Julian passed through Ancyra on his way to an ill-fated campaign against the Persians, and according to Christian sources, engaged in a persecution of various holy men. < ref name=gibbon > {{cite book|last=Gibbon|first=Edward|title=[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]|author-link=Edward Gibbon|page=Chapter 23}} < /ref >  The stone base for a statue, with an inscription describing Julian as  \" Lord of the whole world from the British Ocean to the barbarian nations \" , can still be seen, built into the eastern side of the inner circuit of the walls of Ankara Castle. The Column of Julian which was erected in honor of the emperor's visit to the city in 362 still stands today. In 375, Arian bishops met at Ancyra and deposed several bishops, among them [[Gregory of Nyssa|St. Gregory of Nyssa]]. \n \n In the late 4th century, Ancyra became something of an imperial [[resort|holiday resort]]. After [[Constantinople]] became the [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman]] capital, emperors in the 4th and 5th centuries would retire from the humid summer weather on the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] to the drier mountain atmosphere of Ancyra. [[Theodosius II]] (408\u2013450) kept his court in Ancyra in the summers. Laws issued in Ancyra testify to the time they spent there. \n \n The [[Metropolis of Ancyra]] continued to be a residential [[episcopal see|see]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] until the 20th century, with about 40,000 faithful, mostly Turkish-speaking, but that situation ended as a result of the 1923 [[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations]]. The earlier [[Armenian genocide]] put an end to the residential eparchy of Ancyra of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], which had been established in 1850. < ref name= \" Bull Universi Dominici gregis \" > [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k51627x/f401.image Bull ''Universi Dominici gregis''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330045229/http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k51627x/f401.image |date=30 March 2015 }}, in Giovanni Domenico Mansi, ''Sacrorum Conciliorum Nova et Amplissima Collectio'', vol.

Taking advantage of Seljuk decline, a semi-religious cast of craftsmen and trade people named ''[[Ahis|Ahiler]]'' chose Angora as their independent city-state in 1290. [[Orhan I]], the second [[Bey]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], captured the city in 1356. [[Timur]] defeated [[Bayezid I]] at the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402 and took the city, but in 1403 Angora was again under Ottoman control. \n \n The [[Levant Company]] maintained a factory in the town from 1639 to 1768.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=40\u201341}} In the 19th century, its population was estimated at 20,000 to 60,000.{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=45}} It was sacked by [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egyptian]]s under [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] in 1832.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=40\u201341}} \n \n From 1867 to 1922, the city served as the capital of the [[Angora Vilayet]], which included most of ancient Galatia. \n \n Prior to [[World War I]], the town had a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[consul (representative)|consulate]] and a population of around 28,000, roughly {{frac|1|3}} of whom were Christian.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=40\u201341}} \n \n === Turkish republican capital === \n [[File:An\u0131tkabir.JPG|thumb|left|[[An\u0131tkabir]], the mausoleum of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] in Ankara, is visited by large crowds every year during national holidays such as Republic Day on 29 October.]] \n \n Following the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] defeat in [[World War I]], the Ottoman capital [[Ottoman Constantinople|Constantinople]] (modern Istanbul) and much of [[Anatolia]] was occupied by the Allies, who planned to share these lands between [[First Republic of Armenia|Armenia]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], leaving for the Turks the core piece of land in central Anatolia. In response, the leader of the Turkish nationalist movement, [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], established the headquarters of his [[Turkish National Movement|resistance movement]] in Angora in 1920. After the [[Turkish War of Independence]] was won and the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] was superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]], the Turkish nationalists replaced the Ottoman Empire with the [[Republic of Turkey]] on 29 October 1923.

\n \n === Demographics === \n [[File:Ankara road map.png|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Ankara [[metropolitan area]]]]Ankara had a population of 75,000 in 1927. As of 2019, Ankara Province has a population of 5,639,076. < ref > Turkish Statistical Institute, 1 February 2019 data < /ref > \n When Ankara became the capital of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, it was designated as a planned city for 500,000 future inhabitants. During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the city grew in a planned and orderly pace. However, from the 1950s onward, the city grew much faster than envisioned, because unemployment and poverty forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city in order to seek a better standard of living. As a result, many illegal houses called [[gecekondu]] were built around the city, causing the unplanned and uncontrolled urban landscape of Ankara, as not enough planned housing could be built fast enough. Although precariously built, the vast majority of them have electricity, running water and modern household amenities. \n \n Nevertheless, many of these gecekondus have been replaced by huge public housing projects in the form of [[tower block]]s such as Elvankent, [[Eryaman, Etimesgut|Eryaman]] and [[G\u00fczelkent, Etimesgut|G\u00fczelkent]]; and also as mass housing compounds for military and civil service accommodation. Although many gecekondus still remain, they too are gradually being replaced by mass housing compounds, as empty land plots in the city of Ankara for new construction projects are becoming impossible to find. \n \n \u00c7orum and Yozgat, which are located in Central Anatolia and whose population is decreasing, are the provinces with the highest net migration to Ankara. < ref > https://web.archive.org/web/20110920035746/http://report.tuik.gov.tr/reports/rwservlet?adnksdb2= & report=turkiye_il_koy_sehir.RDF & p_il1=6 & p_kod=2 & p_yil=2008 & desformat=html & ENVID=adnksdb2Env < /ref >  About one third of the Central Anatolia population of 15,608,868 people resides in Ankara. \n \n The population of Ankara has a higher education level than the country average. According to 2008 data, 15-years-higher literacy rate creates 88% of the total provincial population (91% in men and 86% in women). This ratio was 83% for Turkey (88% males, 79% females). This difference is particularly evident in the university educated segment of the population. The ratio of university and high school graduates to total population is 10.6% in Ankara, while 5.4% in Turkey. < ref > http://report.tuik.gov.tr/reports/rwservlet?adnksdb2= & report=il_cinsiyet_yasgrp_egitim_top.RDF & p_kod=2 & p_il1=6 & p_xkod=egitim_kod & p_yil=2008 & desformat=html & ENVID=adnksdb2Env{{Dead link|date=June 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > \n \n ===Transportation=== \n {{See also|Ankara Metro|Ankara Central Station|Esenbo\u011fa International Airport}} \n [[File:Ankara Train Station.JPG|thumb|left|[[Ankara railway station]] is a hub for conventional trains.]] \n [[File:TCDD Ta\u015f\u0131mac\u0131l\u0131k HT65000 at Ankara Tren Gari.jpg|thumb|The new [[Ankara Tren Gar\u0131|ATG terminal]] is a hub for the [[High-speed rail in Turkey|high-speed rail]] ([[Y\u00fcksek H\u0131zl\u0131 Tren|YHT]]) services.]] \n \n The ''Electricity, Gas, Bus General Directorate'' (EGO) < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ego.gov.tr |title=EGO Genel M\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc |publisher=Ego.gov.tr |access-date=5 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123055229/http://www.ego.gov.tr/ |archive-date=23 November 2008 |url-status=live}} < /ref >  operates the [[Ankara Metro]] and other forms of public transportation.

The [[Ankara Province|province of Ankara]] is divided into 25 districts. The CHP's key and almost only political stronghold in Ankara lies within the central area of [[\u00c7ankaya, Ankara (district)|\u00c7ankaya]], which is the city's most populous district. While the CHP has always gained between 60 and 70% of the vote in \u00c7ankaya since 2002, political support elsewhere throughout Ankara is minimal. The high population within \u00c7ankaya, as well as [[Yenimahalle]] to an extent, has allowed the CHP to take overall second place behind the AKP in both local and general elections, with the MHP a close third, despite the fact that the MHP is politically stronger than the CHP in almost every other district. Overall, the AKP enjoys the most support throughout the city. The electorate of Ankara thus tend to vote in favor of the political right, far more so than the other main cities of [[Istanbul]] and [[\u0130zmir]].

''Bak\u0131rc\u0131lar \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131s\u0131'' (Bazaar of Coppersmiths) is particularly popular, and many interesting items, not just of copper, can be found here like jewelry, carpets, costumes, antiques and embroidery. Up the hill to the castle gate, there are many shops selling a huge and fresh collection of spices, [[dried fruit]]s, nuts, and other produce. \n \n Modern shopping areas are mostly found in [[K\u0131z\u0131lay, Ankara|K\u0131z\u0131lay]], or on Tunal\u0131 Hilmi Avenue, including the modern mall of [[List of shopping malls in Turkey#Ankara|Karum]] (named after the ancient [[Assyria]]n merchant colonies called [[K\u00fcltepe#K\u00e2rum Kane\u0161|''K\u00e2rum'']] that were established in [[Central Anatolia Region|central]] [[Anatolia]] at the beginning of the [[2nd millennium BC]]) which is located towards the end of the Avenue; and in [[\u00c7ankaya, Ankara|\u00c7ankaya]], the quarter with the highest elevation in the city.

Likewise, the anchor monument is also related with the Spanish name of the mall, Armada, which means [[naval fleet]]. \n \n As Ankara started expanding westward in the 1970s, several modern, suburbia-style developments and mini-cities began to rise along the western highway, also known as the [[Eski\u015fehir]] Road. The ''Armada'', ''CEPA'' and ''Kentpark'' malls on the highway, the ''Galleria'', ''Arcadium'' and ''Gordion'' in \u00dcmitk\u00f6y, and a huge mall, ''Real'' in Bilkent Center, offer North American and European style shopping opportunities (these places can be reached through the Eski\u015fehir Highway.) There is also the newly expanded ''[[ANKAmall]]'' at the outskirts, on the Istanbul Highway, which houses most of the well-known international brands. This mall is the largest throughout the Ankara region. In 2014 a few more shopping malls were open in Ankara.

Turkish Angoras are one of the ancient, naturally occurring cat breeds, having originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia. \n \n They mostly have a white, silky, medium to long length coat, no undercoat and a fine bone structure. There seems to be a connection between the Angora Cats and [[Persian (cat)|Persians]], and the Turkish Angora is also a distant cousin of the [[Turkish Van]]. Although they are known for their shimmery white coat, there are more than twenty varieties including black, blue and reddish fur. They come in [[tabby cat|tabby]] and tabby-white, along with smoke varieties, and are in every color other than pointed, lavender, and cinnamon (all of which would indicate breeding to an outcross.) \n \n Eyes may be blue, green, or amber, or even one blue and one amber or green. The [[Cat coat genetics#White spotting and epistatic white|W gene]] which is responsible for the white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability, and the presence of a blue eye can indicate that the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located. However, a great many blue and [[odd-eyed cat|odd-eyed]] white cats have normal hearing, and even deaf cats lead a very normal life if kept indoors. \n \n Ears are pointed and large, eyes are almond shaped and the head is massive with a two plane profile. Another characteristic is the tail, which is often kept parallel to the back. \n \n ===Angora goat=== \n {{Main|Angora goat}} \n [[File:Angora1.JPG|thumb|180px|[[Angora goat]]]] \n \n The [[Angora goat]] ({{Lang-tr|Ankara ke\u00e7isi}}) is a breed of [[goat|domestic goat]] that originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia. < ref name= \" Ekarius \" > {{cite book|author=Carol Ekarius|title=Storey's Illustrated Breed Guide to Sheep, Goats, Cattle, and Pigs: 163 Breeds from Common to Rare|date=10 September 2008|publisher=Storey Publishing|isbn=978-1-60342-037-2|page=150}} < /ref > \n \n This breed was first mentioned in the time of [[Moses]], roughly in 1500 & nbsp;BC. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://daisyshillfarm.com/My_Homepage_Files/Page2.html |title=Angora Goats history |publisher=Daisyshillfarm.com |access-date=29 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703174935/http://daisyshillfarm.com/My_Homepage_Files/Page2.html |archive-date=3 July 2009}} < /ref >  The first Angora goats were brought to Europe by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], about 1554, but, like later imports, were not very successful. Angora goats were first introduced in the United States in 1849 by Dr. James P. Davis. Seven adult goats were a gift from Sultan [[Abd\u00fclmecid I]] in appreciation for his services and advice on the raising of cotton. \n \n The [[Pile (textile)|fleece]] taken from an Angora goat is called [[mohair]]. A single goat produces between {{convert|5|and|8|kg|spell=in|lk=out|abbr=off}} of hair per year. Angoras are shorn twice a year, unlike [[Domestic sheep|sheep]], which are shorn only once. Angoras have high nutritional requirements due to their rapid hair growth. A poor quality diet will curtail mohair development. The United States, [[Turkey]], and South Africa are the top producers of mohair. \n \n For a long period of time, Angora goats were bred for their white coat. In 1998, the Colored Angora Goat Breeders Association was set up to promote breeding of colored Angoras. Today, Angora goats produce white, black (deep black to greys and silver), red (the color fades significantly as the goat gets older), and brownish fiber. \n \n Angora goats were depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 50 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknotes of 1938\u20131952. < ref > [http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]    {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hFIaQq0J?url=http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ |date=3 June 2009 }}.
