The taxonomy of the genus has been controversial. In 1753 [[Carl Linnaeus]] created the name ''Amaryllis belladonna'', the [[type species]] of the genus ''Amaryllis''. At the time both South African and South American plants were placed in the same genus; subsequently they were separated into two different genera. The key question is whether Linnaeus's type was a South African plant or a South American plant. If the latter, ''Amaryllis'' would be the correct name for the genus ''[[Hippeastrum]]'', and a different name would have to be used for the genus discussed here. [[Alan W. Meerow]] et al. have briefly summarized the debate, which took place from 1938 onwards and involved botanists on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. The outcome was a decision by the 14th International Botanical Congress in 1987 that ''Amaryllis''  < small > L. < /small >  should be a conserved name (i.e. correct regardless of priority) and ultimately based on a specimen of the South African ''[[Amaryllis belladonna]]'' from the [[George Clifford III|Clifford Herbarium]] at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London. < ref > {{Citation |last1=Meerow |first1=Alan W. |last2=Van Scheepen |first2=Johan |last3=Dutilh |first3=Julie H.A. |year=1997 |title=Transfers from ''Amaryllis'' to ''Hippeastrum (Amaryllidaceae)'' |journal=[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]] |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=15\u201319 |doi=10.2307/1224287 |jstor=1224287 |name-list-style=amp }} < /ref > \n \n ===Species=== \n {{As of|2020|October}}, ''Amaryllis'' had only two accepted species, both native to the [[Cape Provinces]] of South Africa: < ref name= \" POWO_331133-2 \" > {{cite web |title=''Amaryllis'' L. |work=Plants of the World Online |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|url=http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:331133-2 |access-date=2020-10-19 }} < /ref > \n *''[[Amaryllis belladonna]]''  < small > L. < /small >  \u2013 south-west Cape Provinces; introduced into many parts of the world, including California, Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand < ref name= \" POWO_62705-1 \" > {{cite web |title=''Amaryllis belladona'' L. |work=Plants of the World Online |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|url=http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:62705-1 |access-date=2020-10-19 }} < /ref > \n *''[[Amaryllis paradisicola]]''  < small > Snijman < /small >  \u2013 west Cape Provinces \n \n === Phylogeny === \n Amaryllidinae are placed within Amaryllideae as follow: \n \n These are phylogenetically related as follows: \n \n {{clade \n | label1= Tribe '''Amaryllideae''' \n \n | 1= {{clade \n | 1= Subtribe '''Amaryllidinae''' \n | 2= {{clade \n | 1= Subtribe [[Boophoninae]] \n | 2= {{clade \n | 1= Subtribe [[Strumariinae]] \n | 2= Subtribe [[Crininae]] \n  }} \n }} \n }} \n }} \n \n ===Etymology === \n The name ''Amaryllis'' is taken from a shepherdess in [[Virgil]]'s pastoral ''[[Eclogues]]'', (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|[[:wikt:\u1f00\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03c9|\u1f00\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03c9]]}} (''{{lang|el|amarysso}}''), meaning  \" to sparkle \" ) and also from  \" amarella \"  for the bitterness of the bulb. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=amaryllis|title=Behind the Name: Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Amaryllis|author=Mike Campbell|work=Behind the Name}} < /ref > < ref > Linn\u00e9, Carl von. 1737.

In more open sandy areas of the Western Cape, the plant flowers annually. < ref name= \" Biodiveristyexp \"  / >  Plants tend to be very localized in dense concentrations due to the seeds' large size and heavy weight. Strong winds shake loose the seeds, which fall to ground and immediately start to germinate, aided by the first winter rains. < ref name= \" Biodiveristyexp \"  / > \n \n == Ecology == \n The leaves are produced in the autumn or early spring in warm climates depending on the onset of rain and eventually die down by late spring. The bulb is then dormant until late summer. The plant is not frost-tolerant, nor does it do well in tropical environments since they require a dry resting period between leaf growth and flower spike production. \n \n One or two leafless stems arise from the bulb in the dry ground in late summer (March in its native habitat and August in [[hardiness zone|USDA zone 7]]). \n \n The plant has a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with [[carpenter bee]]s. It is also visited by [[Noctuidae|noctuid moths]] at night.

No one knows the exact species it was crossed with to produce color variations of white, cream, peach, magenta and nearly red hues. The hybrids were crossed back onto the original ''Amaryllis belladonna'' and with each other to produce naturally seed-bearing crosses that come in a very wide range of flower sizes, shapes, stem heights and intensities of pink. Pure white varieties with bright green stems were bred as well. The hybrids are quite distinct in that the many shades of pink also have stripes, veining, darkened edges, white centers and light yellow centers, also setting them apart from the original light pink. In addition, the hybrids often produce flowers in a fuller circle rather than the  \" side-facing \"  habit of the  \" old-fashioned \"  pink. The hybrids are able to adapt to year-round watering and fertilization but can also tolerate completely dry summer conditions if need be.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} \n \n ''A. & nbsp;belladonna'' has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]]. < ref > {{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Amaryllis belladonna''|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=115|access-date=21 May 2013}} < /ref > \n \n ''Amaryllis belladonna'' has been crossed in cultivation with ''[[Crinum moorei]]'' to produce a hybrid called [[\u00d7 Amarcrinum|\u00d7 & nbsp;''Amarcrinum'']], < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.pacificbulbsociety.org/pbswiki/index.php/XAmarcrinum|title=Pacific Bulb Society - \u00d7Amarcrinum|work=pacificbulbsociety.org}} < /ref >  which has named cultivars.
