Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element; < ref > {{GoldBookRef|title=Allotrope|file=A00243|accessdate=August 11, 2015}} < /ref >  the [[atom]]s of the element are [[Chemical bond|bonded]] together in a different manner. For example, the [[allotropes of carbon]] include [[diamond]] (the carbon atoms are bonded together in a [[Tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] lattice arrangement), [[graphite]] (the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a [[hexagonal lattice]]), [[graphene]] (single sheets of graphite), and [[fullerene]]s (the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations). \n \n The term ''allotropy'' is used for elements only, not for [[Chemical compound|compounds]]. The more general term, used for any crystalline material, is [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]]. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same [[State of matter|phase]] (i.e.:  [[solid]], [[liquid]] or [[gas]] states); the differences between these states would not alone constitute examples of allotropy. \n \n For some elements, allotropes have different molecular formulae despite difference in phase; for example, two [[allotropes of oxygen]] ([[Oxygen|dioxygen]], O < sub > 2 < /sub > , and [[ozone]], O < sub > 3 < /sub > ) can both exist in the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Other elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different phases; for example, [[phosphorus]] has [[Allotropes of phosphorus|numerous solid allotropes]], which all revert to the same P < sub > 4 < /sub >  form when melted to the liquid state. \n \n ==History== \n The concept of allotropy was originally proposed in 1841 by the Swedish scientist Baron [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius]] (1779\u20131848). < ref name=Jensen > {{citation | last = Jensen | first = W.

E. The Allotropy of the Elements (Elsevier 1964) that many have repeated this advice. < /ref > \n \n ==Differences in properties of an element's allotropes== \n Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours. The change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures, i.e., [[pressure]], [[photochemistry|light]], and [[temperature]]. Therefore, the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions. For instance, [[iron]]  changes from a [[body-centered cubic]] structure ([[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]]) to a [[face-centered cubic]] structure ([[austenite]]) above 906 & nbsp;\u00b0C, and [[tin]] undergoes a modification known as [[tin pest]] from a [[metal]]lic form to a [[semiconductor]] form below 13.2 & nbsp;\u00b0C (55.8 & nbsp;\u00b0F). As an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour, ozone (O < sub > 3 < /sub > ) is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen (O < sub > 2 < /sub > ). \n \n ==List of allotropes== \n Typically, elements capable of variable [[coordination number]] and/or [[oxidation states]] tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms. Another contributing factor is the ability of an element to [[catenation|catenate]]. \n \n Examples of allotropes include: \n \n ===Non-metals=== \n {| class= \" wikitable \" \n |- \n ! Element \n !
