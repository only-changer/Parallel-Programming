He saw extensive combat during his 34-year military career, fighting actions in the [[Black Hawk War]], the [[Texas War of Independence]], the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the [[Utah War]], and the [[American Civil War]]. \n \n Considered by Confederate States President [[Jefferson Davis]] to be the finest general officer in the Confederacy before the later emergence of [[Robert E. Lee]], he was killed early in the Civil War at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] on April 6, 1862. Johnston was the highest-ranking officer, Union or Confederate, killed during the entire war. Davis believed the loss of General Johnston  \" was the turning point of our fate. \" \n \n Johnston was unrelated to Confederate general [[Joseph E. Johnston]]. \n \n ==Early life and education== \n Johnston was born in [[Washington, Kentucky]], the youngest son of Dr. John and Abigail (Harris) Johnston. His father was a native of [[Salisbury, Connecticut]]. Although Albert Johnston was born in Kentucky, he lived much of his life in [[Texas]], which he considered his home. He was first educated at [[Transylvania University]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], where he met fellow student [[Jefferson Davis]]. Both were appointed to the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], Davis two years behind Johnston. < ref name= \" Woodworth46 \" > Woodworth, p. 46. < /ref >  In 1826, < ref name=EB1911 > Chisholm, p. 472 < /ref >  Johnston graduated eighth of 41 cadets in his class from West Point with a commission as a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[2nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|2nd U.S. Infantry]]. < ref name= \" Eicher322 \" > Eicher, p. 322. < /ref > \n \n Johnston was assigned to posts in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Missouri]] and served in the brief [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832 as chief of staff to Bvt. Brig. Gen. [[Henry Atkinson (soldier)|Henry Atkinson]]. \n \n ==Marriage and family== \n [[File:China Grove Plantation.jpg|thumb|China Grove Plantation, Johnston's Texas home]] \n In 1829 he married Henrietta Preston, sister of Kentucky politician and future Civil War general [[William Preston (Kentucky soldier)|William Preston]]. They had one son, [[William Preston Johnston]], who became a colonel in the Confederate States Army. < ref > [http://www.csawardept.com/history/Cabinet/WPJohnston/index.html W.P.

The couple moved to Texas, where they settled on a large [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] in [[Brazoria County, Texas|Brazoria County]]. Johnston named the property  \" China Grove \" . Here they raised Johnston's two children from his first marriage and the first three children born to Eliza and him. A sixth child was born later when the family lived in [[Los Angeles]], where they had permanently settled. \n \n ==Texian Army== \n In 1836 Johnston moved to Texas. < ref name=EB1911/ >  He enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the Texian Army < ref name=EB1911/ >  during the [[Texas War of Independence]] from the Republic of Mexico.  He was named [[Adjutant General of Texas|Adjutant General]] as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the Republic of Texas Army on August 5, 1836. On January 31, 1837, he became senior [[brigadier general]] in command of the Texas Army. \n \n On February 5, 1837, he fought in a duel with Texas Brig. Gen. [[Felix Huston]], who was angered and offended by Johnston's promotion. Johnston was shot through the hip and severely wounded, requiring him to relinquish his post during his recovery. < ref > http://www.texasescapes.com/ClayCoppedge/Dueling.htm < /ref >   \n \n On December 22, 1838, [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], the second president of the [[Republic of Texas]], appointed Johnston as Secretary of War. He provided for the defense of the Texas border against Mexican invasion, and in 1839 conducted a campaign against [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in northern Texas. In February 1840, he resigned and returned to Kentucky. \n \n ==United States Army== \n [[File:AlbertSJohnston.jpg|thumb|Johnston as commander of the Department of Utah. Portrait taken by [[Samuel C. Mills]] at [[Camp Floyd]], Utah Territory, winter of 1858\u201359.]] \n Johnston returned to Texas during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u20131848), under General [[Zachary Taylor]] as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the 1st Texas Rifle Volunteers. The enlistments of his volunteers ran out just before the [[Battle of Monterrey]]. Johnston convinced a few volunteers to stay and fight as he served as the inspector general of volunteers and fought at the battles of Monterrey and [[Battle of Buena Vista|Buena Vista]]. \n \n He remained on his plantation after the war until he was appointed by later 12th president [[Zachary Taylor]] to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as a [[Major (United States)|major]] and was made a paymaster in December 1849. < ref name=EB1911/ >  He served in that role for more than five years, making six tours, and traveling more than {{convert|4000|mi|km}} annually on the Indian frontier of Texas. He served on the Texas frontier at [[Fort Mason (Texas)|Fort Mason]] and elsewhere in the West. \n \n In 1855, 14th president [[Franklin Pierce]] appointed him colonel of the new 2nd U.S. Cavalry (the unit that preceded the modern [[5th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|5th U.S.]]), a new regiment, which he organized, his lieut.-colonel being Robert E. Lee, and his majors were Hardee and Thomas. < ref name=EB1911/ >  On August 19, 1856, Gen. [[Persifor Smith]], at the request of Kansas Territorial Governor Wilson Shannon, sent Col. Johnston with 1300 men composed of the 2d Cavalry Dragoons from [[Fort Riley]], a battalion of the 6th Infantry and [[Albion P. Howe|Capt. Howe's]] artillery company from [[Jefferson Barracks Military Post|Jefferson Barracks]], near [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to protect the [[Kansas Territory|territorial]] capital at [[Lecompton, Kansas|Lecompton]] from an imminent attack by [[James Henry Lane (Union general)|James Henry Lane]] and his abolitionist  \" Army of the North. \" \n \n ==Utah War== \n As a key figure in the [[Utah War]], Johnston took command of the U.S forces in November 1857. This army was sent to install Alfred Cummings as governor of the Utah territory, in place of Brigham Young. After the army wintered at Fort Bridger, Wyoming, a peaceful resolution was reached and in late June 1858 Johnston led the army through Salt Lake city without incident to establish [[Camp Floyd]] some 50 miles distant.  He received a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in 1857 for his service in Utah. He spent 1860 in Kentucky until December 21, when he sailed for California to take command of the Department of the Pacific. \n \n ==Slavery== \n Johnston was a proponent of slavery and a slaveholder.  In 1846 he owned a family of four slaves in Texas. < ref > Roland, p. 141. < /ref >  In 1855, he sold a slave for $1,000 and called this slave's tenure  \" a lifetime of kind treatment. \" < ref > Roland, p. 166. < /ref >   In 1856, he called [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]  \" fanatical, idolotrous, negro worshipping \"  in a letter to his son. < ref > Roland, p. 182. < /ref >   Upon moving to California, Johnston sold one slave to his son and freed another on the condition of a $12/month contract for five more years of servitude.  Johnston's wife, Eliza, celebrated the lack of black people in California, writing  \" where the darky is in any numbers it should be as slaves. \" < ref > Roland, p. 242. < /ref > \n \n ==Civil War== \n [[File:Albert S. Johnston, head and shoulders portrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|Albert S. Johnston in Confederate Army uniform wearing Three Gold Stars and Wreath on a General's Collar]] \n At the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], Johnston was the commander of the U.S. Army [[Department of the Pacific]] < ref name=EB1911/ >  in [[California and the Civil War|California]]. Like many regular army officers from the South, he was opposed to secession. But he resigned his commission soon after he heard of the secession of the Southern states. It was accepted by the War Department on May 6, 1861, effective May 3. < ref > Johnston, p. 273. < /ref >  On April 28 he moved to Los Angeles, the home of his wife's brother [[John Strother Griffin|John Griffin]]. Considering staying in California with his wife and five children, Johnston remained there until May.  A sixth child was born in the family home at Los Angeles, where his eldest son, Capt. Albert S. Johnston, Jr. was later killed in an accidental explosion on a steamer ship while on liberty, in 1863. < ref > [https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d & d=LASTAR18630502.2.6 & srpos=4 & e=-------en--20-LASTAR-1--txt-txIN--------1 \u201cHorrible Catastrophe!\u201d] ''Los Angeles Star.''

He became commander of the Confederacy's western armies in the area often called the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Department]] or Western Military Department. < ref name= \" Woodworth51 \" > Woodworth, p. 51. < /ref > < ref name= \" Long, p. 116 \" > Long, p. 116. < /ref >  Johnston's appointment as a [[General (CSA)|full general]] by his friend and admirer Jefferson Davis already had been confirmed by the Confederate Senate on August 31, 1861. The appointment had been backdated to rank from May 30, 1861, making him the second highest ranking general in the Confederate States Army. Only Adjutant General and Inspector General [[Samuel Cooper (general)|Samuel Cooper]] ranked ahead of him. < ref > Eicher, ''Civil War High Commands.'' p. & nbsp;807. From General Command Line List.

Gen. [[Felix Zollicoffer]] with 4,000 men to occupy [[Cumberland Gap]] in Kentucky in order to block Union troops from coming into eastern Tennessee. The Kentucky legislature had voted to side with the Union after the occupation of Columbus by Polk. < ref name= \" Woodworth52 \" / >  By September 18, Johnston had Brig. Gen. [[Simon Bolivar Buckner]] with another 4,000 men blocking the railroad route to Tennessee at [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]]. < ref name= \" Woodworth52 \" / > < ref > Long, p. 119. < /ref > \n \n Johnston had fewer than 40,000 men spread throughout Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas and Missouri. < ref name= \" Woodworth53 \" > Woodworth, p. 53. < /ref >  Of these, 10,000 were in Missouri under [[Missouri State Guard]] Maj. Gen. [[Sterling Price]]. < ref name= \" Woodworth53 \" / >  Johnston did not quickly gain many recruits when he first requested them from the governors, but his more serious problem was lacking sufficient arms and ammunition for the troops he already had. < ref name= \" Woodworth53 \" / >  As the Confederate government concentrated efforts on the units in the East, they gave Johnston small numbers of reinforcements and minimal amounts of arms and material. < ref name= \" Woodworth55 \" > Woodworth, p. 55. < /ref >  Johnston maintained his defense by conducting raids and other measures to make it appear he had larger forces than he did, a strategy that worked for several months. < ref name= \" Woodworth55 \" / >  Johnston's tactics had so annoyed and confused Union Brig. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in Kentucky that he became paranoid and mentally unstable. Sherman overestimated Johnston's forces, and had to be relieved by Brig. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]] on November 9, 1861. However, in his  < em > Memoirs < /em >  Sherman strongly refutes this account. < ref > Woodworth, pp. 55\u201356 < /ref > < ref > Long, p. 138. < /ref > < ref > McPherson, p. 394 says Johnston had 70,000 troops to defend his territory between the Appalachians and the Ozarks by the end of 1861. < /ref > < ref > < em > The Memoirs of General W.

Gen. [[George B. Crittenden]], a former U.S. Army officer with apparent alcohol problems. < ref > Woodworth, p. 61 < /ref >  While Crittenden was away in Richmond, Zollicoffer moved his forces to the north bank of the upper Cumberland River near Mill Springs (now [[Nancy, Kentucky]]), putting the river to his back and his forces into a trap. < ref > Woodworth, p. 65. < /ref > < ref > Long, pp. 161\u2013162. < /ref >  Zollicoffer decided it was impossible to obey orders to return to the other side of the river because of scarcity of transport and proximity of Union troops. < ref name= \" Woodworth, p. 66 \" > Woodworth, p. 66. < /ref >  When Union Brig. Gen. [[George H. Thomas]] moved against the Confederates, Crittenden decided to attack one of the two parts of Thomas's command at Logan's Cross Roads near Mill Springs before the Union forces could unite. < ref name= \" Woodworth, p. 66 \" / >  At the [[Battle of Mill Springs]] on January 19, 1862, the ill-prepared Confederates, after a night march in the rain, attacked the Union force with some initial success. < ref > Woodworth, pp. 66\u201367. < /ref >  As the battle progressed, Zollicoffer was killed, Crittenden was unable to lead the Confederate force (he may have been intoxicated), and the Confederates were turned back and routed by a Union bayonet charge, suffering 533 casualties from their force of 4,000. < ref > Woodworth, p. 67. < /ref > < ref > Long, p. 162. < /ref >  The Confederate troops who escaped were assigned to other units as General Crittenden faced an investigation of his conduct. < ref > Woodworth, p. 69. < /ref > \n \n After the Confederate defeat at the Mill Springs, Davis sent Johnston a brigade and a few other scattered reinforcements. He also assigned him Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]], who was supposed to attract recruits because of his victories early in the war, and act as a competent subordinate for Johnston. < ref > Woodworth, pp. 71\u201372. < /ref >  The brigade was led by Brig. Gen. [[John B. Floyd]], considered incompetent. He took command at [[Fort Donelson]] as the senior general present just before Union Brig. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] attacked the fort. < ref > Woodworth, pp. 80, 84. < /ref >  Historians believe the assignment of Beauregard to the west stimulated Union commanders to attack the forts before Beauregard could make a difference in the theater. Union officers heard that he was bringing 15 regiments with him, but this was an exaggeration of his forces. < ref name= \" Woodworth7278 \" > Woodworth, pp. 72, 78. < /ref > \n \n ===Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, Nashville=== \n Based on the assumption that Kentucky neutrality would act as a shield against a direct invasion from the north, circumstances that no longer applied in September 1861, Tennessee initially had sent men to Virginia and concentrated defenses in the Mississippi Valley. < ref > Woodworth, p. 54. < /ref > < ref > Eicher, ''The Longest Night''. pp. 111\u2013113. < /ref >  Even before Johnston arrived in Tennessee, construction of two forts had been started to defend the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] rivers, which provided avenues into the State from the north. < ref name= \" Woodworth56 \" > Woodworth, p. 56. < /ref >  Both forts were located in Tennessee in order to respect Kentucky neutrality, but these were not in ideal locations. < ref name= \" Woodworth56 \" / > < ref name= \" Long142 \" > Long, p. 142 < /ref > < ref > Weigley, p. 108 < /ref > < ref > McPherson, p. 393. < /ref >  [[Battle of Fort Henry|Fort Henry]] on the Tennessee River was in an unfavorable low-lying location, commanded by hills on the Kentucky side of the river. < ref name= \" Woodworth56 \" / >  [[Fort Donelson]] on the Cumberland River, although in a better location, had a vulnerable land side and did not have enough heavy artillery to defend against gunboats. < ref name= \" Woodworth56 \" / > \n \n Maj. Gen. Polk ignored the problems of the forts when he took command. After Johnston took command, Polk at first refused to comply with Johnston's order to send an engineer, Lt. Joseph K. Dixon, to inspect the forts. < ref name= \" Woodworth57 \" > Woodworth, p. 57. < /ref >  After Johnston asserted his authority, Polk had to allow Dixon to proceed. Dixon recommended that the forts be maintained and strengthened, although they were not in ideal locations, because much work had been done on them and the Confederates might not have time to build new ones. Johnston accepted his recommendations. < ref name= \" Woodworth57 \" / >  Johnston wanted Major [[Alexander P. Stewart]] to command the forts but President Davis appointed Brig. Gen. [[Lloyd Tilghman]] as commander. < ref name= \" Long142 \" / > < ref name= \" Woodworth57 \" / > \n \n To prevent Polk from dissipating his forces by allowing some men to join a partisan group, Johnston ordered him to send Brig. Gen. Gideon Pillow and 5,000 men to Fort Donelson. < ref name= \" Woodworth58 \" > Woodworth, p. 58. < /ref >  Pillow took up a position at nearby [[Clarksville, Tennessee]] and did not move into the fort until February 7, 1862. < ref > Long, pp. 167\u2013168. < /ref > < ref > Eicher, ''The Longest Night'', p. 171 says the garrison at Fort Donelson numbered 1,956 men before the Fort Henry garrison and the men under Floyd and Pillow joined them in early February 1862. < /ref >  Alerted by a Union reconnaissance on January 14, 1862, Johnston ordered Tilghman to fortify the high ground opposite Fort Henry, which Polk had failed to do despite Johnston's orders. < ref name= \" Woodworth71 \" > Woodworth, p. 71. < /ref >  Tilghman failed to act decisively on these orders, which in any event were too late to be adequately carried out. < ref name= \" Woodworth71 \" / > < ref > McPherson, p. 396. < /ref > < ref > A Confederate battery and the beginning of some fortifications were sited across the river at [[Fort Heiman]] but these were of little value when the Union flotilla appeared. < /ref > \n \n Gen. Beauregard arrived at Johnston's headquarters at Bowling Green on February 4, 1862, and was given overall command of Polk's force at the western end of Johnston's line at Columbus, Kentucky. < ref > Woodworth, p. 78. < /ref > < ref > After some preliminary work with Johnston, Beauregard assumed command of this force, which he named the Army of the Mississippi, on March 5, 1862, while at Jackson, Tennessee. Like the other Confederate commander, he had to withdraw to the south after the fall of the forts or be surrounded by the advancing Union forces. Long, p. 178. < /ref >  On February 6, 1862, [[Union Navy]] gunboats quickly reduced the defenses of ill-sited Fort Henry, inflicting 21 casualties on the small remaining Confederate force. < ref name= \" Woodworth7879 \" > Woodworth, pp. 78\u201379. < /ref > < ref name= \" Long167 \" > Long, p. 167. < /ref >  Brig.

Simon Buckner, having been abandoned by Floyd < ref > Floyd was able to ferry his four Virginia regiments out of the fort with him but left his Mississippi regiment behind to surrender with the rest of the garrison.

One of his most famous moments in the battle occurred when he witnessed some of his soldiers breaking from the ranks to pillage and loot the Union camps, and was outraged to see a young lieutenant among them.   \" None of that, sir, \"  Johnston roared at the officer,  \" we are not here for plunder. \"   Then, realizing he had embarrassed the man, he picked up a tin cup off a table and announced,  \" Let this be my share of the spoils today, \"  before directing his army onward. < ref > {{Cite web | url=https://history.army.mil/news/2013/130401a_shiloh.html | title=CMH Remembers the Battle of Shiloh  & #124; CMH}} < /ref > \n \n At about 2:30 & nbsp;pm, while leading one of those charges against a Union camp near the  \" Peach Orchard, \"  he was wounded, taking a bullet behind his right knee. The bullet clipped a part of his [[popliteal artery]] and his boot filled up with blood.  There were no medical personnel on scene at the time, since Johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded Confederate troops and Union prisoners earlier in the battle. < ref name= \" civilwarlandscapes.org \" > {{cite web|title=Battlefield Tours: Full Tour Shiloh|url=http://www.civilwarlandscapes.org/cwla/states/tn/sh/ftour/1jd.htm|website=Civil War Landscapes Association|access-date=February 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102161211/http://civilwarlandscapes.org/cwla/states/tn/sh/ftour/1jd.htm|archive-date=November 2, 2017|url-status=dead}} < /ref > \n \n Within a few minutes, Johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting. Among his staff was [[Isham G. Harris]], the [[Governor of Tennessee]], who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that [[Abraham Lincoln]] had appointed [[Andrew Johnson]] as military governor of Tennessee. Seeing Johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale, Harris asked:  \" General, are you wounded? \"  Johnston glanced down at his leg wound, then faced Harris and replied in a weak voice his last words:  \" Yes... and I fear seriously. \"  Harris and other staff officers removed Johnston from his horse and carried him to a small ravine near the  \" Hornets Nest \"  and desperately tried to aid the general, who had lost consciousness by this point. Harris then sent an aide to fetch Johnston's surgeon but did not apply a [[tourniquet]] to Johnson's wounded leg. A few minutes later, before a doctor could be found, Johnston died from blood loss. It is believed that Johnston may have lived for as long as one hour after receiving his fatal wound.  Ironically, it was later discovered that Johnston had a tourniquet in his pocket when he died. < ref name= \" civilwarlandscapes.org \" / > \n \n Harris and the other officers wrapped General Johnston's body in a blanket so as not to damage the troops' morale with the sight of the dead general. Johnston and his wounded horse, Fire Eater, were taken to his field headquarters on the Corinth road, where his body remained in his tent for the remainder of the battle.  P. G. T. Beauregard assumed command of the army and resumed leading the Confederate assault, which continued advancing and pushed the Union force back to a final defensive line near the Tennessee river.  With his army exhausted and daylight almost gone, Beauregard called off the final Confederate attack around 1900 hours, figuring he could finish off the Union army the following morning.  However, Grant was reinforced by 20,000 fresh troops from [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s [[Army of the Ohio]] during the night, and led a successful counter-attack the following day, driving the Confederates from the field and winning the battle.  As the Confederate army retreated back to Corinth, Johnston's body was taken to the home of Colonel William Inge, which had been his headquarters in Corinth. It was covered in the Confederate flag and lay in state for several hours. < ref > Sword, pp. 270\u201373, 443\u201346; Cunningham, pp. 273\u201376; Smith, pp. 26\u201334.
