Consequently, an adult who engages in sexual activity with a person younger than the age of consent is unable to legally claim that the sexual activity was consensual, and such sexual activity may be considered [[child sexual abuse]] or [[statutory rape]]. The person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim, and their sex partner is regarded as the offender, unless both are underage. The purpose of setting an age of consent is to protect an underage person from sexual advances. \n \n The term ''age of consent'' rarely appears in legal [[statute]]s. < ref name= \" waites \" > {{cite book| last=Waites |first=Matthew |title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship |url=https://archive.org/details/waites-aoc |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |year=2005 |isbn=1-4039-2173-3 |oclc=238887395}} < /ref > {{page needed|date=August 2017}} Generally, a law will establish the age below which it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with that person. It has sometimes been used with other meanings, such as the age at which a person becomes competent to consent to [[marriageable age|marriage]], < ref > ''Oxford English Dictionary'', entry for  \" age of consent \" < /ref >  but the meaning given above is the one now generally understood. It should not be confused with other laws regarding age minimums including, but not limited to, the [[age of majority]], [[defense of infancy|age of criminal responsibility]], [[voting age]], [[Legal drinking age|drinking age]], and [[List of countries by minimum driving age|driving age]]. \n \n [[List of countries by age of consent|Age of consent laws]] vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, < ref name= \" waites \"  / >  though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18. The laws may also vary by the type of sexual act, the gender of the participants or other considerations, such as involving a [[position of trust]]; some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a single age. Charges and penalties resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a [[misdemeanor]], such as ''corruption of a minor'', to what is popularly called ''statutory rape''. \n \n There are many  \" grey areas \"  in this area of law, some regarding unspecific and untried legislation, others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes, and others due to conflicts between [[federal law|federal]] and [[state law|state]] laws. These factors all make age of consent an often confusing subject and a topic of highly charged debates. < ref name= \" waites \"  / > \n \n == By continent == \n {{main|List of countries by age of consent}} \n [[File:Age of Consent - Global.svg|alt=Map of the world's countries, with countries colored by age of consent|thumb|upright=2|Age of consent for heterosexual sex in various countries \n < br > {{legend inline|#FFA07A|puberty}} \n {{legend inline|#FEF592|12}} \n {{legend inline|#7FFFD4|13}} \n {{legend inline|#00CED1|14}} \n {{legend inline|#1E90FF|15}} \n {{legend inline|#0000CD|16}} \n {{legend inline|#808000|17}} \n {{legend inline|#32CD32|18}} \n < br > {{legend inline|#FF1493|must be married}} \n {{legend inline|#D3D3D3|no data available / other}}]] \n \n ===Africa=== \n * [[Ages of consent in Africa]] \n \n ===Americas=== \n * [[Ages of consent in North America]] \n ** [[Ages of consent in the United States]] \n * [[Ages of consent in South America]] \n \n ===Asia=== \n * [[Ages of consent in Asia]] \n \n ===Europe=== \n * [[Ages of consent in Europe]] \n \n ===Oceania=== \n * [[Ages of consent in Oceania]] \n \n ==History and social attitudes== \n \n ===Traditional attitudes=== \n In traditional societies, the age of consent for a sexual union was a matter for the family to decide, or a tribal custom.

In England, for example, the only reliable data in the early modern period comes from property records made after death. Not only were the records relatively rare, but not all bothered to record the participants' ages, and it seems that the more complete the records are, the more likely they are to reveal young marriages. Modern historians have sometimes shown reluctance to accept evidence of young ages of marriage, dismissing it as a 'misreading' by a later copier of the records. < ref name= \" Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent \" / > \n \n In the 12th century, [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], the influential compiler of [[canon law]] in [[medieval]] Europe, accepted the age of puberty for marriage (not sex) to be around twelve for girls and around fourteen for boys but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if both children were older than seven years of age. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |first=John |last=Noonan |date=1967 |website=[[Catholic University of America]] |title=Marriage Canons from the Decretum of Gratian and the Decretals, Sext, Clementines and Extravagantes |quote=If one over the age of seven takes a prepubescent wife of less than seven and transfers her to his house, such a contract gives rise to the impediment of public propriety. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117042750/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Canon%20Law/marriagelaw.htm |archive-date=17 January 2016 }} < /ref >  There were authorities that said that such consent for entering marriage could take place earlier. Marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty, or if they had already consummated the marriage. Judges sometimes honored marriages based on mutual consent at ages younger than & nbsp;seven: in contrast to established canon, there are recorded marriages of two- and three-year-olds. < ref name= \" Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, A-Ar, Age of Consent \" / > \n \n The first ''recorded'' age-of-consent law dates from 1275 in England; as part of its provisions on rape, the [[Statute of Westminster 1275]] made it a misdemeanor to  \" ravish \"  a  \" maiden within age, \"  whether with or without her consent.

Early feminists of the [[Social Purity movement]], such as [[Josephine Butler]] and others, instrumental in securing the repeal of the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]], began to turn towards the problem of [[child prostitution]] by the end of the 1870s. Sensational media revelations about the scourge of child prostitution in London in the 1880s then caused outrage among the respectable middle-classes, leading to pressure for the age of consent to be raised again. \n \n The investigative journalist [[William Thomas Stead]] of the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' was pivotal in exposing the problem of child prostitution in the London underworld through a publicity stunt. In 1885 he  \" purchased \"  one victim, [[The Eliza Armstrong Case|Eliza Armstrong]], the thirteen-year-old daughter of a [[chimney sweep]], for five pounds and took her to a brothel where she was drugged. He then published a series of four expos\u00e9s entitled ''[[The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon]]'', which shocked its readers with tales of child prostitution and the abduction, procurement, and sale of young English virgins to Continental  \" pleasure palaces \" . The  \" Maiden Tribute \"  was an instant sensation with the reading public, and Victorian society was thrown into an uproar about prostitution. Fearing riots on a national scale, the [[Home Secretary]], [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|Sir William Harcourt]], pleaded in vain with Stead to cease publication of the articles. A wide variety of reform groups held protest meetings and marched together to [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] demanding that the age of consent be raised. The government was forced to propose the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]], which raised the age of consent from thirteen to sixteen and clamped down on prostitution. < ref > {{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/0/20097046|title = Child prostitutes: How the age of consent was raised to 16|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140727184445/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/0/20097046|archive-date = 27 July 2014|last = Hogenbloom|first = Melissa|date = 1 November 2012|publisher = BBC History}} < /ref > \n \n In the United States, as late as the 1880s most states set the minimum age at ten to twelve (in Delaware, it was seven in 1895). < ref > {{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 15, 1895|title=PURITY CONGRESS MEETS; A Great Gathering for Moral Work in the City of Baltimore.

For example, in England and Wales the age of consent is 16, but if the person is a student of the older person it becomes & nbsp;18. \n \n ; Circumstances of the relationship: In several jurisdictions, it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with a person under a certain age under certain circumstances regarding the relationship in question, such as if it involves taking advantage of or corrupting the morals of the young person. For example, while the age of consent is 14 in Germany and 16 in Canada, it is illegal in both countries to engage in sexual activity with a person under 18 if the activity exploits the younger person. Another example is in Mexico, where there is a crime called  \" estupro \"  defined as sexual activity with a person over the age of consent but under a certain age limit (generally 18) in which consent of the younger person was obtained through seduction and/or deceit. In Pennsylvania, the age of consent is officially 16, but if the older partner is 18 or older, he/she may still be prosecuted for corruption of minors if he/she corrupts or tends to corrupt the morals of the younger person. \n \n ===Extraterritoriality=== \n {{see also|Child sex tourism#Extraterritorial jurisdiction}} \n A growing number of countries have specific [[Extraterritorial jurisdiction|extraterritorial legislation]] that prosecutes their citizens in their homeland should they engage in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign country with children.

Traditionally, age of consent laws regarding vaginal intercourse were often meant to protect the chastity of unmarried girls. < ref name= \" chnm.gmu.edu \" / >  Many feminists and social campaigners in the 1970s have objected to the social importance of virginity, and have also attempted to change the stereotypes of female passivity and male aggression; demanding that the law protect children from exploitation regardless of their gender, rather than dealing with concerns of chastity. This has led to gender-neutral laws in many jurisdictions. < ref name= \" chnm.gmu.edu \" / >  On the other hand, there is an opposing view which argues that the act of vaginal intercourse is an  \" unequal act \"  for males and females, due to issues such as pregnancy, increased risk of STDs, < ref > UNFPA writes that  \" Biologically, women's risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections during unprotected sexual relations is two to four times that of men. \" [http://www.unfpa.org/resources/giving-special-attention-girls-and-adolescents] < /ref >  and risk of physical injury if the girl is too young and not physically ready. In the US, in ''[[Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County|Michael M. v.
