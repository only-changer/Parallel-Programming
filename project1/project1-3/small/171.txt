The Greeks used it for making jewelry and beads. \n \n ''Brazilian agate'' is found as sizable geodes of layered nodules. These occur in brownish tones inter-layered with white and gray. Quartz forms within these nodules, creating a striking specimen when cut opposite the layered growth axis. It is often dyed in various colors for ornamental purposes. \n \n ''Polyhedroid agate'' forms in a flat-sided shape similar to a [[polyhedron]]. When sliced, it often shows a characteristic layering of concentric [[Polygon|polygons]]. It has been suggested that growth is not crystallographically controlled but is due to the filling-in of spaces between pre-existing crystals which have since dissolved. \n \n Other forms of agate include Holley blue agate (also spelled  \" Holly blue agate \" ), a rare dark blue ribbon agate only found near [[Holley, Oregon]]; [[Lake Superior agate]]; Carnelian agate (has reddish hues); Botswana agate; plume agate; [[condor agate]]; tube agate containing visible flow channels or pinhole-sized  \" tubes \" ; fortification agate with contrasting concentric banding reminiscent of defensive ditches and walls around ancient forts; [[Binghamite]], a variety found only on the Cuyuna iron range (near Crosby) in Crow Wing County, Minnesota; [[fire agate]] showing an iridescent, internal flash or  \" fire \" , the result of a layer of clear agate over a layer of hydrothermally deposited hematite; [[Patuxent River stone]], a red and yellow form of agate only found in [[Maryland]]; [[enhydro agate]] contains tiny inclusions of water, sometimes with air bubbles. \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 130px \" > \n Fossil agatized coral Florida.JPG|alt=A piece of translucent pink agatized coral, with a  \" ruffled \"  appearance along the top edge|Agatized coral \n Dendritic agate.jpg|Dendritic agate \n Elimia fossils Wyoming.jpg|alt=An irregular dark stone with a flat polished front; many white fragments of elongated, spiral,  \" corkscrew \"  shells seem to float in the dark stone| \" Turritella agate \"  (''[[Elimia tenera]]'') \n Crazy Lace Agate - Macro Panorama.jpg|Crazy lace agate \n < /gallery > \n \n ==Uses in industry and art== \n Industrial uses of agate exploit its hardness, ability to retain a highly polished surface finish and resistance to chemical attack. It has traditionally been used to make knife-edge bearings for [[laboratory balance]]s and precision pendulums, and sometimes to make [[Mortar and pestle|mortars and pestles]] to crush and mix chemicals. It has also been used for centuries for [[leather burnishing]] tools. \n \n The decorative arts use it to make ornaments such as [[pins]], [[brooch]]es or other types of [[jewellery]], paper knives, [[inkstand]]s, [[marbles]] and [[seal (emblem)|seals]]. Agate is also still used today for decorative displays, cabochons, beads, carvings and [[Intarsia]] art as well as face-polished and tumble-polished specimens of varying size and origin. [[Idar-Oberstein]] was one of the centers which made use of agate on an industrial scale. Where in the beginning locally found agates were used to make all types of objects for the European market, this became a globalized business around the turn of the 20th century: Idar-Oberstein imported large quantities of agate from Brazil, as ship's ballast. Making use of a variety of proprietary chemical processes, they produced colored beads that were sold around the globe. < ref > [http://www.farlang.com/art/2007-04-15.7721093142 Background Article on Idar Oberstein] < /ref >  Agates have long been used in arts and crafts.
