Her husband was the son of Widerich (born {{circa|lk=no|450}}), grandson of Berismund (born {{circa|lk=no|410}}), and great-grandson of [[Thorismund]] (died after 400), [[Ostrogoths#Ostrogothic rulers|king of the Ostrogoths]] {{circa|lk=no|400}}. It was important to Amalasuintha's father, [[Theoderic the Great]], that she marry into a legitimate royal family, lest her own family's legitimacy be questioned. < ref name= \" :1 \"  / > \n \n She was very much an intellectual, and was well known for her extensive knowledge and reading, which included fluency in Latin, Greek and [[Gothic language|Gothic]].

Her tremendous influence in her position as regent can be seen in a [[diptych]] of [[Rufius Gennadius Probus Orestes]] in which she appears alongside her son, Athalaric, in 530. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >  Deeply imbued with the old Roman culture, she gave to that son's education a more refined and literary turn than suited the ideas of her Gothic subjects. Conscious of her unpopularity she banished \u2013 and afterwards put to death \u2013 three Gothic nobles whom she suspected of conspiring against her rule. At the same time, she opened negotiations with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] with the view of removing herself and the Gothic treasure to [[Constantinople]]. Her son's death on 2 October 534 initially made little apparent change in the state of affairs. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" > {{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amalasuntha|volume=1|page=777}} < /ref > \n \n After Athalaric's death, Amalasuintha became queen, ruling alone only for a short while before making her cousin [[Theodahad]] co-ruler (not, as sometimes stated, her husband, for his wife was still living), < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  with the intent of strengthening her position. Theodahad was a prominent leader of the Gothic military aristocracy, the very group that so opposed her pro-Roman stances. Amalasuintha believed this pairing would help to make supporters out of her harshest critics. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >  The choice was unfortunate, for Theodahad fostered the disaffection of the Goths, and either by his orders or with his permission, Amalasuintha was imprisoned on the island of Martana, located in the [[Lake Bolsena|lake of Bolsena]] in northern Lazio, where on 30 April in the spring of 534/535 she was murdered in her bath. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / > \n \n ==Death== \n {{seealso|Gothic War (535\u2013554)}} \n The death of Amalasuintha gave [[Justinian I]] a reason to go to war with the Ostrogoths and attempt to take Italy. According to the Eastern Roman historian [[Procopius]], it is believed that Amalasuintha and Justinian I had a very close diplomatic relationship. More specifically, Procopius believed that Amalasuintha was thinking about handing over Italy to Justinian around the time of her death. < ref name= \" :3 \" > {{Cite journal|last=Sarantis|first=Alexander|date=2009|title=War and Diplomacy in Pannonia and the Northwest Balkans during the Reign of Justinian: The Gepid Threat and Imperial Responses|jstor=41219761|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers |volume=63|pages=15\u201340}} < /ref >  Shortly after Amalasuintha's murder, Theodahad was replaced by [[Vitiges|Witigis]], Amalasuintha's son-in-law.
