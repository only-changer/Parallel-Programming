''[[Robinia pseudoacacia]]'', an American species locally known as black locust, is sometimes called  \" false acacia \"  in [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and throughout Europe. \n \n ==Description== \n \n [[File:Acacia facsiculifera seedling.jpg|thumb|''[[Acacia fasciculifera]]'' seedling in the transitional stage between pinnate leaves and phyllodes]] \n The leaves of acacias are compound [[pinnate]] in general. In some species, however, more especially in the Australian and [[Pacific Islands]] species, the leaflets are suppressed, and the leaf-stalks ([[Petiole (botany)|petioles]]) become vertically flattened in order to serve the purpose of leaves. These are known as  \" [[phyllode]]s \" . The vertical orientation of the phyllodes protects them from intense sunlight since with their edges towards the sky and earth they do not intercept light as fully as horizontally placed leaves. A few species (such as ''[[Acacia glaucoptera]]'') lack leaves or phyllodes altogether but instead possess [[wikt:cladode|cladodes]], modified leaf-like [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] stems functioning as leaves. \n \n The small flowers have five very small petals, almost hidden by the long [[stamens]], and are arranged in dense, globular or cylindrical clusters; they are yellow or cream-colored in most species, whitish in some, or even purple (''Acacia purpureopetala'') or red ([[Acacia leprosa 'Scarlet Blaze'|''Acacia leprosa'' 'Scarlet Blaze']]). ''Acacia'' flowers can be distinguished from those of a large related genus, ''[[Albizia]]'', by their stamens, which are not joined at the base. Also, unlike individual ''[[Mimosa]]'' flowers, those of ''Acacia'' have more than ten stamens. < ref > {{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurcharan|title=Plant Systematics: An Integrated Approach|publisher=Science Publishers|year=2004|page=445|isbn=978-1-57808-351-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=In_Lv8iMt24C}} < /ref > \n \n The plants often bear spines, especially those species growing in arid regions. These sometimes represent branches that have become short, hard, and pungent, though they sometimes represent leaf-[[stipule]]s. ''[[Acacia armata]]'' is the kangaroo-thorn of Australia, and ''[[Acacia erioloba]]'' (syn. ''Acacia eriolobata'') is the camelthorn of Africa. \n \n Acacia seeds can be difficult to germinate. Research has found that immersing the seeds in various temperatures (usually around 80 & nbsp;\u00b0C (176 & nbsp;\u00b0F)) and manual seed coat chipping can improve growth to around 80%. < ref > {{cite journal |author1=J Clemens |author2=PG Jones |author3=NH Gilbert |year=1977|title=Effect of seed treatments on germination in Acacia|journal=Australian Journal of Botany |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=269\u2013276 |doi=10.1071/BT9770269}} < /ref > \n \n ==Symbiosis== \n [[File:Acacia collinsii3.jpg|thumb|''[[Acacia collinsii]]'' stipules]] \n [[File:Acacia drepanolobium MHNT.BOT.2011.3.97.jpg|thumb|Swollen stipules of ''Acacia drepanolobium'' that serve as ant [[domatia]].

Most Australian ''Acacia'' species introduced to South Africa have become an enormous problem, due to their naturally aggressive propagation.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The pods of ''A. nilotica'' (under the name of ''neb-neb''), and of other African species, are also rich in tannin and used by [[Tanning (leather)|tanners]]. In [[Yemen]], the principal tannin substance was derived from the leaves of the salam-tree (''Acacia etbaica''), a tree known locally by the name ''qara\u1e93'' (''garadh''). < ref > ''R. Moss b.

The water and leaves, however, required changing after seven or eight days, and the leather needed to be turned over daily. \n \n ===Wood=== \n [[File:Starr 030405-0092 Acacia koa.jpg|thumb|''[[Acacia koa]]'' wood]] \n Some ''Acacia'' species are valuable as timber, such as ''A. melanoxylon'' (blackwood) from [[Australia]], which attains a great size; its wood is used for furniture, and takes a high polish; and ''A. omalophylla'' (myall wood, also Australian), which yields a fragrant timber used for ornaments. ''[[Acacia seyal|A. seyal]]'' is thought to be the [[shittah-tree]] of the [[Bible]], which supplied shittim-wood. According to the Book of Exodus, this was used in the construction of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. ''[[Acacia koa|A. koa]]'' from the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and ''[[Acacia heterophylla|A. heterophylla]]'' from [[R\u00e9union]] are both excellent timber trees. Depending on abundance and regional culture, some ''Acacia'' species (e.g. ''A. fumosa'') are traditionally used locally as firewoods. < ref > {{cite web|author=Maugh, T.H.

This is suitable in [[Woodfree uncoated paper|lightweight offset papers]] used for Bibles and dictionaries. It is also used in paper tissue where it improves softness. \n \n ===Land reclamation=== \n Acacias can be planted for erosion control, especially after mining or construction damage. < ref > {{cite journal |author1=Barr, D.

One of the most globally significant invasive acacias is [[Acacia mearnsii|black wattle ''A. mearnsii'']], which is taking over grasslands and abandoned agricultural areas worldwide, especially in moderate coastal and island regions where mild climate promotes its spread. Australian/New Zealand Weed Risk Assessment gives it a  \" high risk, score of 15 \"  rating and it is considered one of the world's 100 most invasive species. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.hear.org/pier/species/acacia_mearnsii.htm |title=Acacia mearnsii (PIER species info) |publisher=Hear.org |access-date=2013-03-06}} < /ref > \n Extensive ecological studies should be performed before further introduction of acacia varieties, as this fast-growing genus, once introduced, spreads quickly and is extremely difficult to eradicate. \n \n ==Phytochemistry== \n \n ===Cyanogenic glycosides=== \n Nineteen different species of ''Acacia'' in the Americas contain [[glycoside|cyanogenic glycosides]], which, if exposed to an [[enzyme]] which specifically splits glycosides, can release [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN) in the  \" leaves \" . < ref > {{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3671484 | volume=32 | title=Cyanogenic Glycosides in Ant-Acacias of Mexico and Central America | year=1987 | journal=The Southwestern Naturalist | last1 = Seigler | first1 = David S.| issue=4 | pages=499\u2013503 | jstor=3671484 }} < /ref >  This sometimes results in the poisoning death of [[livestock]]. \n \n If fresh plant material spontaneously produces 200 ppm or more HCN, then it is potentially toxic. This corresponds to about 7.5 \u03bcmol HCN per gram of fresh plant material. It turns out that, if acacia  \" leaves \"  lack the specific glycoside-splitting enzyme, then they may be less toxic than otherwise, even those containing significant quantities of cyanic glycosides. < ref name= \" chemotaxonomie \" > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YpnboQBbw7EC & q=acacia+tryptamine & pg=PA336 |title=Chemotaxonomie der Pflanzen By Robert Hegnauer |date= 1996-01-01|access-date=2013-03-06|isbn=9783764351656|last1=Hegnauer |first1=R. }} < /ref > \n \n Some ''Acacia'' species containing cyanogens include ''[[Acacia erioloba]]'', ''A. cunninghamii'', ''A. obtusifolia'', ''A. sieberiana'', and ''A. sieberiana'' var.
