Flown in [[low Earth orbit]], it was the second crewed Apollo mission that the United States launched via a [[Saturn V]] rocket, and was the first flight of the full [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo spacecraft]]: the [[command and service module]] (CSM) with the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM). The mission was flown to [[flight qualify|qualify]] the LM for lunar orbit operations in preparation for the first Moon landing by demonstrating its [[descent propulsion system|descent]] and [[ascent propulsion system]]s, showing that its crew could fly it independently, then [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|dock]] with the CSM again, as would be required for [[Apollo 11|the first crewed lunar landing]]. Other objectives of the flight included firing the LM descent engine to propel the spacecraft stack as a backup mode (as would be required on the [[Apollo 13]] mission), and use of the [[portable life support system]] backpack outside the LM cabin. \n \n The three-man crew consisted of Commander [[James McDivitt]], Command Module Pilot [[David Scott]], and Lunar Module Pilot [[Rusty Schweickart]]. During the ten-day mission, they tested systems and procedures critical to landing on the Moon, including the LM engines, backpack life support systems, navigation systems and docking maneuvers. \n \n After launching on March 3, 1969, the crew performed the first crewed flight of a lunar module, the first docking and extraction of the same, one two-person [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalk]] (EVA), and the second docking of two crewed [[spacecraft]]\u2014two months after the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] performed a spacewalk crew transfer between {{nowrap|[[Soyuz 4]]}} and {{nowrap|[[Soyuz 5]]}}. The mission concluded on March 13 and was a complete success. It proved the LM worthy of crewed spaceflight, setting the stage for the dress rehearsal for the lunar landing, [[Apollo 10]], before the ultimate goal, landing on the Moon. \n \n == Mission background == \n {{further|Apollo program}} \n \n In April 1966, McDivitt, Scott, and Schweickart were selected by Director of Flight Crew Operations [[Deke Slayton]] as the second Apollo crew. Their initial job was as backup to the first Apollo crew to be chosen, [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger Chaffee]], for the first crewed Earth orbital test flight of the [[Apollo command and service module#Development history|block I command and service module]], < ref > {{cite news |title='Open End' Orbit Planned for Apollo |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ReojAAAAIBAJ & dq=apollo-1 & pg=7152%2C998301 |agency=United Press International |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Press|The Pittsburgh Press]] |location=Pittsburgh, PA |date=August 4, 1966 |page=20 |access-date=July 11, 2019|via=Google News}} < /ref >  designated [[Apollo 1|AS-204]].

Flight Director Gene Kranz deemed the Apollo{{nbsp}}9 crew the best prepared for their mission, and felt Scott was an extremely knowledgeable CMP.{{sfn|French  &  Burgess|p=330}} Crew members underwent some 1,800 hours of mission-specific training, about seven hours for every hour they would spend in flight. Their training even started on the day before the Apollo{{nbsp}}1 fire, in the very first Block II spacecraft in which they were originally intended to fly. They took part in the vehicle checkouts for the CSM at [[North American Rockwell]]'s facility in [[Downey, California]], and for the LM at [[Grumman]]'s plant in [[Bethpage, New York]]. They also participated in testing of the modules at the launch site.{{sfn|Press Kit|p=83}} \n \n Among the types of the training which the crew underwent were simulations of [[zero-G]], both underwater and in the [[Vomit Comet]]. During these exercises, they practiced for the planned extravehicular activities (EVAs). They traveled to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], for training on the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]] (AGC) at [[MIT]]. The crew studied the sky at the [[Morehead Planetarium]] and at the [[Griffith Planetarium]], especially focusing on the 37 stars used by the AGC. They each spent more than 300 hours in the CM and LM simulators at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) and at Houston, some involving live participation by Mission Control. Additional time was spent in simulators in other locations.{{sfn|Press Kit|pp=83\u201384}} \n \n [[File:Aerial view of the Apollo 9 space vehicle on the way from the Vehicle Assembly Building to Pad A.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large rocket being moved by crawler|The launch vehicle for Apollo{{nbsp}}9 being taken to Pad 39A]] \n \n The first mission to use the CSM, the LM and a Saturn{{nbsp}}V, Apollo{{nbsp}}9 allowed the launch preparations team at KSC its first opportunity to simulate the launch of a lunar landing mission. The LM arrived from Grumman in June 1968 and was subjected to extensive testing including in the altitude chamber, simulating space conditions. As this occurred, other technicians assembled the Saturn{{nbsp}}V inside the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB). The CM and SM arrived in October, but even the experienced KSC team from North American had trouble joining them together. When the lander was done with the altitude chamber, the CSM took its place, letting the LM be available for installation of equipment such as rendezvous radar and antennas. There were no lengthy delays, and on January 3, 1969, the launch vehicle was taken out of the VAB and moved to [[Launch Complex 39]]A by crawler. Flight readiness reviews for the CM, the LM, and the Saturn{{nbsp}}V were held and passed in the following weeks. < ref name= \" chariots_double \" > [[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 12.3: [https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch12-3.html  \" A double workload \" ] < /ref > \n \n == Hardware == \n \n === Launch vehicle === \n The [[Saturn V]] (AS-504) used on Apollo{{nbsp}}9 was the fourth to be flown, the second to carry astronauts to space,{{sfn|Press Kit|p=8}} and the first to bear a lunar module. Although similar in configuration to the Saturn{{nbsp}}V used on Apollo 8, several changes were made. The inner core of the F-1 engine chamber in the first (S-IC) stage was removed, thus saving weight and allowing for a slight increase in [[specific impulse]]. Weight was also saved by replacing the skins of the [[liquid oxygen]] tanks with lighter ones, and by providing lighter versions of other components. Efficiency was increased in the S-II second stage with uprated J-2 engines, and through a closed-loop propellant utilization system rather than Apollo 8's open-loop system.{{sfn|Mission Report|pp=A-59, inside back cover}} Of the {{convert|3250|lb}} weight reduction in the second stage, about half came from a 16 percent reduction in the thickness of the tank side walls.{{sfn|''Science News'' 1969-03-22b|p=283}} \n \n === Spacecraft, equipment and call signs === \n [[File:Lunar Module 3 arrives at KSC aboard Super Guppy (KSC-68PC-85).jpg|thumb|alt=cased LM on airplane in hangar|LM-3 arrives at KSC, June 1968]] \n \n Apollo{{nbsp}}9 used CSM-104, the third block II CSM to be flown with astronauts aboard. Apollo 8, lacking a lunar module, did not have docking equipment; Apollo{{nbsp}}9 flew the probe-and-drogue assembly used for docking along with other equipment added near the forward hatch of the CM; this allowed for rigid docking of the two craft, and for internal transfer between CM and LM.{{sfn|Mission Report|pp=A-1, inside back cover}} Had the switch in missions between Apollo{{nbsp}}8 and{{nbsp}}9 not occurred, the Earth-orbit mission would have flown CSM-103, which flew on Apollo 8.{{sfn|French  &  Burgess|pp=338\u2013339}} \n \n The Earth-orbit mission was originally supposed to use LM-2 as its lunar module, but the crew found numerous flaws in it, many associated with it being the first flight-ready lunar module off Grumman's production line.

If it was not possible to make such a docking, the lunar landing could not take place. It was Scott's responsibility to fly the CSM, which he did to a successful docking, as the probe-and-drogue docking assembly worked properly. After McDivitt and Schweickart inspected the tunnel connecting the CM and LM, the assembled spacecraft separated from the S-IVB. The next task was to demonstrate that two docked spacecraft could be maneuvered by one engine. The five-second burn took place at 05:59.01.1 into the mission, accomplished with the SM's [[Service Propulsion System]] (SPS), after which Scott excitedly reported the LM was still in place.

The experience would teach the doctors enough about the sickness to have the astronauts avoid it on the lunar landings, but at the time Schweickart feared his vomiting might endanger Kennedy's goal. They were well enough to continue with the day's plan, and entered the LM, thus transferring between vehicles for the first time in the US space program, and making the first ever transfer without needing to spacewalk, as Soviet cosmonauts had. The hatches were then closed, though the modules remained docked, showing that ''Spider''{{'s}} communications and life support systems would work in isolation from those of ''Gumdrop''.
