  "{{Short description|A continuous time-varying signal}} \n {{Broader|Signal}} \n {{refimprove|date=September 2015}} \n {{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}} \n {{Use American English|date=July 2018}} \n \n An '''analog signal'''  is any [[continuous signal]] for which the time-varying feature of the signal is a representation of some other time-varying quantity, i.e., ''analogous'' to another time-varying signal. For example, in an analog [[audio signal]], the instantaneous [[voltage]] of the signal varies continuously with the [[Sound pressure|pressure of the sound waves]].  \n \n In contrast, a [[digital signal]] represents the original time-varying quantity as a [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] sequence of [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantized]] values. This imposes some [[Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem|bandwidth]] and [[dynamic range]] constraints on the representation but, unlike the analog signal, can avoid further [[Noise (electronics)|electronic noise]] and [[distortion]]. \n \n The term ''analog signal'' usually refers to [[electrical signal]]s; however, [[Classical mechanics|mechanical]], [[pneumatic]], [[hydraulic]], and other systems may also convey or be considered analog signals. \n \n ==Representation== \n An analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal's information. For example, an [[aneroid barometer]] uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information.  In an electrical signal, the [[voltage]], [[Electric current|current]], or [[frequency]] of the signal may be varied to represent the information. \n     \n Any information may be conveyed by an analog signal; such a signal may be a measured response to changes in a physical variable, such as [[sound]], [[light]], [[temperature]], position, or [[pressure]].  The physical variable is converted to an analog signal by a [[transducer]].   For example, sound striking the diaphragm of a [[microphone]] induces corresponding fluctuations in the current produced by a coil in an electromagnetic microphone or the voltage produced by a [[condenser microphone]].  The voltage or the current is said to be an ''analog'' of the sound. \n \n ==Noise== \n {{See also|Comparison of analog and digital recording}} \n \n An analog signal is subject to [[Noise (electronics)|electronic noise]] and [[distortion]] introduced by [[communication channel]]s, [[Analog recording|recording]] and [[signal processing]] operations, which can progressively degrade the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR). As the signal is transmitted, copied, or processed, the unavoidable noise introduced in the signal path will accumulate as a [[generation loss]], progressively and irreversibly degrading the SNR, until in extreme cases, the signal can be overwhelmed. Noise can show up as [[Tape hiss|hiss]] and [[intermodulation distortion]] in audio signals, or [[Noise (video)|snow]] in [[Analog video|video signals]]. Generation loss is irreversible as there is no reliable method to distinguish the noise from the signal. \n \n In contrast, although [[Analog-to-digital converter|converting an analog signal to digital form]] introduces a low-level [[quantization noise]] into the signal due to finite resolution of digital systems, once in digital form, the signal can be transmitted, stored, or processed without introducing significant additional noise or distortion. \n \n Noise accumulation in analog systems can be minimized by [[electromagnetic shielding]], [[balanced line]]s, [[low-noise amplifier]]s and high-quality electrical components. \n \n In analog systems, it is difficult to detect when such degradation occurs.  However, in digital systems, degradation can not only be [[Error detection and correction|detected but corrected as well]]. \n \n ==See also== \n {{div col|colwidth=20em}} \n * [[Amplifier]] \n * [[Analog computer]] \n * [[Analog device]] \n * [[Analog signal processing]] \n * [[Magnetic tape]] \n * [[Preamplifier]] \n {{div col end}} \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist}} \n \n {{Telecommunications}} \n \n {{Authority control}} \n \n {{DEFAULTSORT:Analog Signal}} \n [[Category:Analog circuits]] \n [[Category:Electronic design]] \n [[Category:Television terminology]] \n [[Category:Video signal]]"
