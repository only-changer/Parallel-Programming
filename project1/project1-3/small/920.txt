[[Tuna]] [[Commercial fishing|fishing]] and [[Fish processing|processing]] plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna being the primary export. Transfers from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] add substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. \n \n [[File:Figure 13 Canning Production Line at StarKist Samoa Cannery (49995644721) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A [[StarKist]] tuna cannery.
