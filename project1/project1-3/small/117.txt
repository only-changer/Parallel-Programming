Most adobe buildings are similar in appearance to [[cob (material)|cob]] and [[rammed earth]] buildings. Adobe is among the earliest building materials, and is used throughout the world. \n \n ==Description== \n Adobe bricks are rectangular prisms small enough that they can quickly air dry individually without cracking. They can be subsequently assembled, with the application of adobe mud to bond the individual bricks into a structure.  There is no standard size, with substantial variations over the years and in different regions. In some areas a popular size measured {{convert|8|\u00d7|4|\u00d7|12|in|cm}} weighing about {{convert|25|lb|kg}}; in other contexts the size is {{convert|10|\u00d7|4|\u00d7|14|in|cm}} weighing about {{convert|35|lb|kg}}. The maximum sizes can reach up to {{convert|100|lb|kg}}; above this weight it becomes difficult to move the pieces, and it is preferred to ram the mud ''in situ'', resulting in a different typology known as [[rammed earth]]. \n \n ==Strength== \n In dry climates, adobe structures are extremely durable, and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world. Adobe buildings offer significant advantages due to their greater [[thermal mass]], but they are known to be particularly susceptible to earthquake damage if they are not reinforced. < ref > [http://www.livingatlaschile.com/?s=adobe {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624140043/http://www.livingatlaschile.com/?s=adobe |date=24 June 2017 }} Short documentary about adobe preparation and [[2010 Chile earthquake]]] Livingatlaschile.com, FICh.

The word can be traced from the [[Middle Egyptian language|Middle Egyptian]] (c. 2000 & nbsp;BC) word ''\u025fbt''  \" mud brick \" . Middle Egyptian evolved into [[Late Egyptian language|Late Egyptian]], [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] or  \" pre-Coptic \" , and finally to Coptic (c. 600 & nbsp;BC), where it appeared as \u03c4\u03c9\u03c9\u03b2\u03b5 {{IPA|t\u014d\u02bep\u0259}}.

The [[soil]] composition typically contains [[sand]], [[silt]] and [[clay]]. Straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly, thereby preventing cracking due to uneven shrinkage rates through the brick. < ref > {{cite journal|last=Vargas|first=J.|author2=J.

Modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or Portland cement up to 10% by weight. \n \n No more than half the clay content should be [[expansive clay]]s, with the remainder non-expansive illite or kaolinite. Too much expansive clay results in uneven drying through the brick, resulting in cracking, while too much kaolinite will make a weak brick. Typically the soils of the Southwest United States, where such construction has been widely used, are an adequate composition. < ref > {{cite web|last=Austin |first=George |url=http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/publications/periodicals/nmg/downloads/6/n4/nmg_v6_n4_p69.pdf |work=New Mexico Geology, November 1984 |publisher=New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources |title=Adobe as a building material |url-status=dead |access-date=27 February 2013 |page=70 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232337/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/publications/periodicals/nmg/downloads/6/n4/nmg_v6_n4_p69.pdf |archive-date=2 December 2013 }} < /ref > \n \n ==Material properties== \n [[File:Djenne great mud mosque.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Mosque of Djenn\u00e9]], [[Mali]], is built in adobe. The struts projecting from the wall serve as decoration, as well as supports for scaffolding during maintenance.]] \n Adobe walls are load bearing, i.e. they carry their own weight into the foundation rather than by another structure, hence the adobe must have sufficient compressive strength. In the United States, most building codes < ref > {{cite web|url=http://quentinwilson.squarespace.com/storage/adobecode.pdf |title=14.7.4 NMAC |access-date=25 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818200926/http://quentinwilson.squarespace.com/storage/adobecode.pdf |archive-date=18 August 2013 }} < /ref >  call for a minimum compressive strength of 300 & nbsp;lbf/in < sup > 2 < /sup >  (2.07 & nbsp;newton/mm < sup > 2 < /sup > ) for the adobe block. Adobe construction should be designed so as to avoid lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads. The building codes require the building sustain a 1 g lateral acceleration earthquake load. Such an acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls, resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile stresses. To withstand such loads, the codes typically call for a tensile modulus of rupture strength of at least 50 & nbsp;lbf/in < sup > 2 < /sup >  (0.345 & nbsp;newton/mm < sup > 2 < /sup > ) for the finished block. \n \n In addition to being an inexpensive material with a small resource cost, adobe can serve as a significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction. In climates typified by hot days and cool nights, the high thermal mass of adobe mediates the high and low temperatures of the day, moderating the temperature of the living space. The massive walls require a large and relatively long input of heat from the sun ([[radiation]]) and from the surrounding air ([[convection]]) before they warm through to the interior. After the sun sets and the temperature drops, the warm wall will continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the time-lag effect. Thus, a well-planned adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling inside temperature through the wide daily fluctuations typical of desert climates, a factor which has contributed to its longevity as a building material. \n \n Thermodynamic material properties have significant variation in the literature. Some experiments suggest that the standard consideration of conductivity is not adequate for this material, as its main thermodynamic property is inertia, and conclude that experimental tests should be performed over a longer period of time than usual - preferably with changing thermal jumps. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Michael, Philokyprou, Thravalou, Ioannou|year=2016|title=The role of adobes in the thermal performance of vernacular dwellings|url=https://craterre.hypotheses.org/files/2018/07/TERRA-2016_Th-4_Art-071_Michael_corr.pdf|journal=Terra Lyon 2016}} < /ref >  There is an effective [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] for a north facing 10-in wall of R0=10 hr ft < sup > 2 < /sup >  \u00b0F/Btu, < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.greenhomebuilding.com/QandA/adobe/mass.htm|title=Mass and insulation with adobe|access-date=12 December 2019}} < /ref >  which corresponds to thermal conductivity k=10 in x 1 & nbsp;ft/12 in /R0=0.33 Btu/(hr ft \u00b0F) or 0.57 W/(m K) in agreement with the thermal conductivity reported from another source. < ref > {{cite book|title=Experimental Measurements of Thermal Properties for Mexican Building Materials to Simulate Thermal Behavior to Save Energy|last1=Ch\u00e1vez-Gal\u00e1n|first1=Jesus|last2=Almanza|first2=Rafael|last3=Rodr\u00edguez|first3=Neftali|publisher=Spriner|year=2008|isbn=978-3-540-75996-6|pages=496\u2013501|chapter=Experimental {{sic|?|Measurments}} of Thermal Properties for Mexican Building Materials to Simulate Thermal Behavior to Save Energy|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-75997-3_89}} < /ref >  To determine the total R-value of a wall, scale R < sub > 0 < /sub >  by the thickness of the wall in inches.

In North America, the brick is typically about {{convert|25|by|36|cm|0|abbr=on}} in size. The mixture is molded into the frame, which is removed after initial setting. After drying for a few hours, the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying. Slow drying in shade reduces cracking. \n \n The same mixture, without straw, is used to make [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and often [[plaster]] on interior and exterior walls. Some cultures used [[Lime (material)|lime]]-based cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} \n \n Depending on the form into which the mixture is pressed, adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size, provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks. Reinforcement can include manure, straw, cement, [[rebar]], or wooden posts. Straw, cement, or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can produce a stronger, more crack-resistant brick. < ref > {{cite web|author=Technical Information Online |url=https://infohub.practicalaction.org/bitstream/handle/11283/314561/5110df27-5b44-4243-920e-37c50a310b36.pdf |title=Mud Plasters and Renders |publisher=Practicalaction.org |access-date=9 November 2010}} < /ref >  A test is done on the soil content first. To do so, a sample of the soil is mixed into a clear container with some water, creating an almost completely saturated liquid. The container is shaken vigorously for one minute. It is then allowed to settle for a day until the soil has settled into layers. Heavier particles settle out first, sand above, silt above that, and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days. After the water has cleared, percentages of the various particles can be determined. Fifty to 60 percent sand and 35 to 40 percent clay will yield strong bricks. The [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service]] at New Mexico State University recommends a mix of not more than \u2153 clay, not less than \u00bd sand, and never more than \u2153 silt.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} \n \n ===Adobe wall construction=== \n [[File:Fort Saint-S\u00e9bastien - Visite des fouilles juin 2012 68.jpg|thumb|The [[earthen plaster]] removed, exposing the adobe bricks at Fort St. Sebastien in France]] \n The ground supporting an adobe structure should be compressed, as the weight of adobe wall is significant and foundation settling may cause cracking of the wall. Footing depth is to be below the ground frost level. The footing and stem wall are commonly 24 and 14 inches thick, respectively.  Modern construction codes call for the use of reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall. Adobe bricks are laid by course. Adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength. When creating window and door openings, a [[lintel]] is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above. Atop the last courses of brick, bond beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces. To protect the interior and exterior adobe walls, finishes such as mud plaster, whitewash or stucco can be applied. These protect the adobe wall from water damage, but need to be reapplied periodically. Alternatively, the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection. Bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters. \n \n ===Adobe roof=== \n The traditional adobe roof has been constructed using a mixture of soil/clay, water, sand and organic materials. The mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms, producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across a support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe. \n \n Depending on the materials available, a roof may be assembled using wood or metal beams to create a framework to begin layering adobe bricks. Depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks, the framework has been preformed using a steel framing and a layering of a metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly. This method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent cracking. \n \n The more traditional flat adobe roofs are functional only in dry climates that are not exposed to snow loads. The heaviest wooden beams, called [[Viga (architecture)|vigas]], lie atop the wall. Across the vigas lie smaller members called latillas < ref > {{cite web|url=http://dl-building.com/preservation-historic-adobe-buildings/ |title=Preservation of Historic Adobe Buildings |publisher=Dawson Lupul |access-date=30 January 2014}} < /ref >  and upon those brush is then laid. Finally, the adobe layer is applied. \n \n To construct a flat adobe roof, beams of wood were laid to span the building, the ends of which were attached to the tops of the walls. Once the vigas, latillas and brush are laid, adobe bricks are placed. An adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a greater expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the roof. Following each individual brick should be a layer of adobe mortar, recommended to be at least {{convert|1|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} thick to make certain there is ample strength between the brick's edges and also to provide a relative moisture barrier during rain. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/construction/materials/adobe-construction2.htm|title=How Adobe Construction Works|date=2012-04-17|work=Add Water, Then Stir \u2013 How Adobe Construction Works {{!}} HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}} < /ref > \n \n Roof design evolved around 1850 in the American Southwest. Three inches of adobe mud was applied on top of the latillas, then 18 inches of dry adobe dirt applied to the roof. The dirt was contoured into a low slope to a downspout aka a 'canal'. When moisture was applied to the roof the clay particles expanded to create a waterproof membrane. Once a year it was necessary to pull the weeds from the roof and re-slope the dirt as needed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} \n \n Depending on the materials, adobe roofs can be inherently fire-proof. The construction of a chimney can greatly influence the construction of the roof supports, creating an extra need for care in choosing the materials. The builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in a similar fashion as the surrounding walls. \n \n In 1927, the [[Uniform Building Code]] (UBC) was adopted in the United States. Local ordinances, referencing the UBC added requirements to building with adobe. These included: restriction of building height of adobe structures to 1-story, requirements for adobe mix (compressive and shear strength) and new requirements which stated that every building shall be designed to withstand seismic activity, specifically lateral forces. By the 1980s however, seismic related changes in the California Building Code effectively ended solid wall adobe construction in California; however Post-and-Beam adobe and veneers are still being used. \n \n ==Adobe around the world== \n The largest structure ever made from adobe is the [[Arg-\u00e9 Bam]] built by the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Other large adobe structures are the [[Huaca del Sol]] in Peru, with 100 million signed bricks and the ''ciudellas'' of [[Chan Chan]] and [[Tambo Colorado]], both in Peru. \n {{wide image|Ancient Bam, 2002.png|1000px|align-cap=center|The [[citadel]] of [[Bam, Iran]], or [[Arg-\u00e9 Bam]], in [[Kerman Province]], [[Iran]]: The world's largest adobe structure, dating to at least 500 & nbsp;BC}} \n \n < gallery widths= \" 180px \"  heights= \" 180px \"  perrow= \" 4 \" > \n File:RomaniaDanubeDelta MakingMaterialForCOnstructing0003jpg.JPG|Still in production today, [[Romania]]'s [[Danube Delta]] \n File:RomaniaDanubeDelta MakingMaterialForCOnstructing0002jpg.JPG|Mixing mud and straw in brick frames \n File:RomaniaDanubeDelta MakingMaterialForCOnstructing0001jpg.JPG|Community effort \n File:Milyanfan-adobe-brick-house-8039.jpg|Adobe brick house under construction in [[Kyrgyzstan]] \n File:Sa'dah 02.jpg|House in [[Sa'dah]], Yemen \n File:AdobeHouseVrancea.JPG|Adobe brick house under construction in [[Romania]] \n File:5640-Linxia-City-Dongguan-back-street.jpg|An adobe wall in [[Linxia City]], Gansu, China \n File:Poeh museum, night.jpg|[[Poeh Museum]] tower, the tallest adobe structure in [[New Mexico]], US \n File:16 21 2688 san miguel.jpg|[[San Miguel Mission]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] \n File:Great Mosque of Djenn\u00e9 3.jpg|[[Great Mosque of Djenn\u00e9]], famous building made from [[Mudbrick#Banco|banco]], a type of adobe \n < /gallery > \n \n ==See also== \n * {{annotated link|Alker}} \n * {{annotated link|Cas di torto}} \n * {{annotated link|Cob (building)}} \n * {{annotated link|Compressed earth block}} \n * {{annotated link|Earth structure}} \n * {{annotated link|Hassan Fathy}} \n * {{annotated link|Mission San Xavier del Bac}} \n * {{annotated link|Monterey Colonial architecture}} used adobe walls \n * {{annotated link|Mudbrick}} \n * {{annotated link|Qadad}} (waterproofing plaster) \n * {{annotated link|Qalat (fortress)}} \n * {{annotated link|Rammed earth}} \n * {{annotated link|Sod house}} \n * {{annotated link|Superadobe}} \n * {{annotated link|Taq Kasra}} (also known as Ctesiphon Arch) in Iraq is the largest mud brick arch in the world, built beginning in 540 AD \n * {{annotated link|Wattle and daub}} \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n \n ==External links== \n {{Commons category|Adobe}} \n {{Wiktionary|adobe}} \n \n {{Prehistoric technology}} \n {{Authority control}} \n \n [[Category:Soil-based building materials]] \n [[Category:Masonry]] \n [[Category:Adobe buildings and structures]] \n [[Category:Appropriate technology]] \n [[Category:Vernacular architecture]] \n [[Category:Sustainable building]] \n [[Category:Buildings and structures by construction material]]"
