The size of the upper [[canine tooth]] in ''A. ramidus'' males was not distinctly different from that of females. Their upper canines were less sharp than those of modern common chimpanzees in part because of this decreased upper canine size, as larger upper canines can be honed through wear against teeth in the lower mouth.

In particular, it has been used to suggest that the [[last common ancestor]] of hominids and African apes was characterized by relatively little aggression between males and between groups. This is markedly different from social patterns in common chimpanzees, among which intermale and intergroup aggression are typically high. Researchers in a 2009 study said that this condition  \" compromises the living chimpanzee as a behavioral model for the ancestral hominid condition. \" < ref name= \" Suwa_2009b \" / > \n \n ''A. ramidus'' existed more recently than the [[most recent common ancestor]] of humans and chimpanzees ([[Chimpanzee-human last common ancestor|CLCA or ''Pan''-''Homo'' LCA]]) and thus is not fully representative of that common ancestor. Nevertheless, it is in some ways unlike chimpanzees, suggesting that the common ancestor differs from the modern chimpanzee. After the chimpanzee and human lineages diverged, both underwent substantial evolutionary change. Chimp feet are specialized for grasping trees; ''A. ramidus'' feet are better suited for walking. The canine teeth of ''A. ramidus'' are smaller, and equal in size between males and females, which suggests reduced male-to-male conflict, increased pair-bonding, and increased parental investment.  \" Thus, fundamental reproductive and social behavioral changes probably occurred in hominids long before they had enlarged brains and began to use stone tools, \"  the research team concluded. < ref name= \" AndThePaleobiology \"  / > \n \n === Ardi === \n {{Main|Ardi}} \n On October 1, [[2009 in science|2009]], paleontologists formally announced the discovery of the relatively complete ''A. ramidus'' fossil skeleton first unearthed in 1994.

The study also provides support for Stephen Jay Gould's theory in [[Ontogeny and Phylogeny (book)|''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'']] that the paedomorphic (childlike) form of early hominin craniofacial morphology results from dissociation of growth trajectories. \n \n Clark and Henneberg also argued that such shortening of the skull\u2014which may have caused a descension of the [[larynx]]\u2014as well as lordosis\u2014allowing better movement of the larynx\u2014increased vocal ability, significantly pushing back the [[origin of language]] to well before the evolution of ''Homo''. They argued that self domestication was aided by the development of vocalization, living in a pro-social society. They conceded that chimps and ''A. ramidus'' likely had the same vocal capabilities, but said that ''A. ramidus'' made use of more complex vocalizations, and vocalized at the same level as a human infant due to [[selective pressure]] to become more social. This would have allowed their society to become more complex. They also noted that the base of the skull stopped growing with the brain by the end of juvenility, whereas in chimps it continues growing with the rest of the body into adulthood; and considered this evidence of a switch from a gross skeletal anatomy trajectory to a neurological development trajectory due to selective pressure for sociability. Nonetheless, their conclusions are highly speculative. < ref > {{cite journal|first1=G.|last1=Clark|first2=M.|last2=Henneberg|year=2017|title=''Ardipithecus ramidus'' and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability|journal=Homo|volume=68|issue=2|pages=101\u2013121|doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001|pmid=28363458}} < /ref > < ref name= \" Clark  &  Henneberg 2015 \" > {{cite journal |doi=10.1515/anre-2015-0009 |title=The life history of Ardipithecus ramidus: A heterochronic model of sexual and social maturation |journal=Anthropological Review |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=109\u2013132|year=2015 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej |doi-access=free }} < /ref > \n \n According to [[Scott Simpson (anthropologist)|Scott Simpson]], the Gona Project's [[biological anthropology|physical anthropologist]], the fossil evidence from the [[Middle Awash]] indicates that both ''A. kadabba'' and ''A. ramidus'' lived in  \" a mosaic of woodland and grasslands with lakes, swamps and springs nearby, \"  but further research is needed to determine which habitat ''Ardipithecus'' at Gona preferred. < ref name= \" stoneageinstitute.org \"  / > \n \n Anatomically, Ardi is closer to the [[orangutan]] than to the [[chimpanzee]], bonobo or [[gorilla]]. All three are adapted for knuckle walking on the forest floor and climbling trees. The orangutan spends virtually its entire life in the forest canopy. Its anatomy allows for maximum reach by its upper limbs for overhead branches while its lower limbs have a narrow stance that enables it to balance while walking  \" foot over foot \"  on lower branches and vines. Although not as closely related genetically as the knuckle walking apes, this that Ardi was behaviourly more similar to the orangutan than to the other three great apes. In nature, the orangutan is widely dispersed.  There is one dominant male in a territory with wide cheek flaps who maintains contact with others in his territory by vocalizations. The female raises offspring one at a time with a maturation period of about eight years. This is the longest maturation period of any of the apes. During this period, the offspring learns the intricate task of weaving a sleeping platform. Rescue centers are now raising young orangutans that have lost their mother typically from deforestation. They are raised in age cohorts by these centers to learn the necessary skills to be able to be released into the forest. While in these cohorts, they show social behavior reminiscent of age appropriate behavior of [[human]] children. This suggests that Ardi was physically preadapted for bipedal locomotion as well social behavior. \n \n == See also == \n * ''[[Australopithecus]]'' \n * ''[[Paranthropus]]'' \n * ''[[Graecopithecus]]'' \n * [[List of human evolution fossils]] \n * ''[[Orrorin]]'' \n * ''[[Sahelanthropus]]'' \n \n == References == \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n \n == External links == \n {{Wikispecies}} \n {{Commons category|Ardipithecus}} \n * [http://www.sciencemag.org/ardipithecus/ Science Magazine: ''Ardipithecus'' special] (requires free registration) \n * The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program: \n ** [http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/ardipithecus-kadabba Ardipithecus kadabba] \n ** [http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/ardipithecus-ramidus Ardipithecus ramidus] \n * [http://www.archaeologyinfo.com/ardipithecusramidus.htm ''Ardipithecus ramidus''] at Archaeology info \n * [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/human-evolution/human-ancestor ''Explore Ardipithecus''] at [[National Geographic Magazine|NationalGeographic.com]] \n * [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/326/5949/64.full?sid=0e89e15f-0594-40ef-9dce-2b9b9f48d9e6 ''Ardipithecus ramidus'' - Science Journal Article] \n * [https://web.archive.org/web/20130228131344/http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/ardipithecus/ardipithecus.html Discovering Ardi - Discovery Channel] \n * [http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-evolution-timeline-interactive Human Timeline (Interactive)] \u2013 [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], [[National Museum of Natural History]] (August 2016). \n {{Human Evolution}} \n {{Breakthrough of the Year}} \n {{Portal bar|Evolutionary biology|Science}} \n {{Taxonbar|from=Q106565}} \n {{Authority control}} \n \n [[Category:Hominini]] \n [[Category:Prehistoric primate genera]] \n [[Category:Pliocene primates]] \n [[Category:Transitional fossils]] \n [[Category:Fossil taxa described in 1995]] \n [[Category:Prehistoric Ethiopia]] \n [[Category:Miocene genus first appearances]] \n [[Category:Zanclean extinctions]]"
