It was incorporated as '''Apple Computer, Inc.''', in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the [[Apple II]], grew quickly. \n \n Jobs and Wozniak hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line starting in Jobs' garage. Apple [[initial public offering|went public]] in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative [[graphical user interface]]s, such as the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee, < ref name= \" wozemployee \" > {{Cite news |url= http://woz.org/letters/never-left-apple/ |title= I Never Left Apple |date= January 3, 2018 |work= Officially Woz |access-date= October 2, 2018 |language= en-US}} < /ref >  while Jobs resigned to found [[NeXT]], taking some Apple co-workers with him. < ref name= \" rice19850415 \"  / > \n \n As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of [[Microsoft Windows]] on [[Intel]] PC clones. The board recruited [[CEO]] [[Gil Amelio]] to what would be a 500-day attempt to rehabilitate the financially troubled company\u2014reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product focus. He led Apple to buy NeXT in 1997, solving a failed operating system strategy and bringing Jobs back. \n \n Jobs regained leadership status, becoming CEO in September 1997. Apple swiftly returned to profitability under the revitalizing  \" [[Think different]] \"  campaign, rebuilding Apple's status by launching the [[iMac G3|iMac]] and [[iPod classic|iPod]], opening a retail chain of [[Apple Store]]s in 2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software portfolio. The company was renamed to Apple Inc. in 2007, reflecting a focus toward consumer electronics, and launched the [[iPhone]] to critical acclaim and financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and [[Tim Cook]] became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company. In June 2019, [[Jony Ive]], Apple's [[Chief design officer|CDO]], left the company to start his own firm but stated he would work with Apple as its primary client. \n \n Apple's worldwide annual revenue totaled $274.5 & nbsp;billion for the 2020 [[fiscal year]].

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]], a Swiss linguist and [[semiotician]], created a semiotic model that identifies two parts of a sign: the [[signified and signifier]]. The signifier is the perceptual component that we physically see, and the signified is then the concept which the sign refers to. In Saussure\u2019s model, the sign results from the recognition of a sound or object with a concept. In his model, the signified and signifier are \u201cas inseparable as two sides of a piece of paper \" . < ref name= \" Chandler \" > {{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=Daniel|title=Semiotics: The Basics|date=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|edition=3rd}} < /ref >  The second popular semiotic model that exists is the Peircean Model. [[Charles Sanders Pierce]] was a logician. His model, like Saussure\u2019s model, involved the relationship between the elements of signs and objects. However, the Peircean model added that whoever is decoding the sign must have some previous understanding or knowledge about the transmitted message. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Parmentier |first1=Richard |title=Signs in society: Studies in semiotic anthropology |date=1994 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0253327571}} < /ref >  Peirce\u2019s model can be represented using the three sides of triangle: the [[representamen]] (the sign), an object (what the sign represents), and the [[interpretant]] (the produced effect by the sign). < ref name=Chandler/ > \n \n The symbolic representation that a [[brand]] carries can affect how a [[consumer]] \u201crecalls, internalizes, and relates\u201d to the performance of a company. There is plenty of evidence to show that a company can easily fail if they do not keep track of how the brand changes with the [[media culture]]. Semiotic research can be used to help a company relate to their customer\u2019s culture over time and help their brand to stand out in competitive markets. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Oswald |first1=L. |title=The structural semiotics paradigm for marketing research: theory, methodology, and case analysis. |journal=Semiotica |date=2015 |volume=2015 |issue=205 |pages=115\u2013148 |doi= 10.1515/sem-2015-0005|s2cid=53117665 }} < /ref > \n \n The first two Apple logos are drastically different from each other. However, they both share the sign of an apple. In the original logo designed by [[Ronald Wayne]], [[Sir Isaac Newton]] is seen sitting under the infamous apple tree about to bear fruit above, just before his discovery of gravity. Analysis of the [[semiotics]] with Saussure's model yields the signified, or sign, of the apple. The signifier represents discovery, innovation, and the notion of thought. < ref name= \" SlideShare \" > {{cite web|last1=Rohan|first1=R.|title=Semiotics Analysis of Apple Inc.

The company\u2019s mission was, and still is, to simplify technology for everyday life. A fun and clever logo that spoke to computer-savvy people was needed. In 1977, [[Rob Janoff]] created the iconic rainbow apple symbol that is still recognized today. The logo has double meaning and differs from the many serious corporate logos in existence at the time.{{Sfn|Linzmayer|2004}}{{page needed|date=June 2020}} \n \n Apple Inc. is well known for being an innovative company who challenge the status quo and established standards. Again, using Saussure\u2019s semiotic model, the signified, is an apple, but with a bite taken out of it. Because Apple is seen as a challenger in the industry, the most common signifier is the forbidden fruit from the Biblical reference, the Garden of Eden. < ref name= \" Cowin \" > {{cite web|last1=Cowin|first1=E.|title=The evolution of U.S. corporate logos a semiotic analysis|url=http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024 & context=etd|access-date=March 27, 2020}} < /ref >  The signified is the bite from the apple, and the represented signifier is the tree of knowledge, thus symbolizing Apple as a rebellious young company ready to challenge the world < ref name=SlideShare/ >  and the promise of knowledge that an entire culture of Apple users may gain from the product. < ref name=Cowin/ > \n \n The [[semiotics]] of the bite and the color of the logo can also be looked at from a technological viewpoint. The bite is the [[signified]] and the computer storage unit, [[byte]], is the [[signifier]]. The rainbow color of the logo portrays the message that its [[computer monitor]] could be producing color images. < ref name=SlideShare/ >  [[Steve Jobs]] argued that color was crucial for  \" humanizing the company \"  at that time. < ref name=Cowin/ > \n \n The only thing to change with the logo since 1977 has been the color. In 1998, a [[monochromatic]] logo was implemented with the release of the first [[iMac]]. This is the first Mac to not have the iconic rainbow-colored apple since its creation 20 years prior. < ref name= \" Biricik \" > {{cite document|last1=Biricik|first1=Asli|title=The role of logo design in creating brand emotion: A semiotic comparison of the Apple and IBM logos|year=2006|citeseerx=10.1.1.427.5285}} < /ref >  The new look represents a new era of Apple Inc.

He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating  \" Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success \" . He acknowledges that people are wishing for the  \" excitement of revolution \" , but argues that people want  \" the comfort that comes with harmony \" . Furthermore, he writes that  \" a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned \" , referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] did not have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity).

Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data.  \" Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley \" , Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies. Though switching Siri's functions to [[machine learning]] and [[algorithm]]s, which dramatically cut its error rate, the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of Amazon's [[Amazon Echo|Echo]], which features the [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] personal assistant.

According to ''The New York Times,'' in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the  \" [[Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich]], \"  which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean. < ref > {{Cite news |last1=Duhigg |first1=Charles |last2=Kocieniewski |first2=David |title=How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 29, 2012 |date=April 28, 2012}} < /ref > \n \n [[British Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament [[Charlie Elphicke]] published research on October 30, 2012, < ref > {{Cite news |last= Watson |first= Roland |title= Foreign companies 'avoid billions in corporation tax' |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3583772.ece |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date= October 30, 2012}} < /ref >  which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard [[corporation tax]].
