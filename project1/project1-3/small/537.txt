Together with [[Pyrrho]], he accompanied [[Alexander the Great]] into Asia. The reports of his philosophical views suggest that he was a forerunner of [[Pyrrhonism]]. [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] writes that he was called Eudaemonicus or  \" Happy Man \"  ({{lang-grc|\u0395\u1f50\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03c2}}). < ref name= \" Varia_Historia_9.37 \" > [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0545.tlg002.perseus-grc1:9.37 Aelian, Varia Historia, 9.37] < /ref > < ref > Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ''Lives'', ix. 60 < /ref > \n \n ==Life== \n {{Pyrrhonism sidebar}}  \n Anaxarchus was born at [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] in [[Thrace]]. He was the companion and friend of [[Alexander the Great]] in his Asiatic campaigns. According to [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]], in response to Alexander's claim to have been the son of Zeus-Ammon, Anaxarchus pointed to his bleeding wound and remarked,  \" See the blood of a mortal, not [[ichor]], such as flows from the veins of the immortal gods. \" < ref name= \" La\u00ebrtius60 \" > Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ''Lives'', ix. 60 < /ref >  [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], writes that Anaxarchus laughed at Alexander for making himself a God and said,  \" The hopes of our God are in a porringer of broth \" , when the physician prescribed a broth to Alexander. < ref name= \" Varia_Historia_9.37 \" / > \n \n [[Plutarch]] tells a story that at [[Bactra]], in 327 & nbsp;BC in a debate with [[Callisthenes]], he advised all to worship Alexander as a god even during his lifetime, as they would surely do it after he died.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} \n \n When Alexander was trying to show that he is divine so that the Macedonians would perform [[proskynesis]] to him, Anaxarchus said that Alexander could  \" more justly be considered a god than [[Dionysus]] or [[Heracles]] \" , as Dionysus was Theban while Heracles was Alexander's non-Macedonian ancestor. (Arrian, 104). \n \n Diogenes La\u00ebrtius says that [[Nicocreon of Cyprus|Nicocreon]], the tyrant of [[Cyprus]], commanded him to be pounded to death in a mortar, and that he endured this torture with fortitude. [[Cicero]] relates the same story. < ref name= \" La\u00ebrtius58 \" > Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ''Lives'', ix. 58 < /ref > \n \n ==Philosophy== \n Very little is known about his philosophical views. It is thought that he represents a link between the [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]], and the [[Pyrrhonism|skepticism]] of [[Pyrrho]]. \n \n Anaxarchus is said to have studied under Diogenes of Smyrna, whose teachings were said to be the same as those of Democritus' student [[Protagoras]]. < ref > Kathleen Freeman, ''Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers: A Complete Translation of the Fragments in Diels, Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'' 1983 {{ISBN|0674035011}} p 121 < /ref >  Diogenes studied under [[Metrodorus of Chios]], who used to declare that he knew nothing, not even the fact that he knew nothing. < ref name= \" La\u00ebrtius58 \" / >  According to [[Sextus Empiricus]], Anaxarchus  \" compared existing things to a scene-painting and supposed them to resemble the impressions experienced in sleep or madness. \" < ref > Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Logicians'', 7.88. < /ref >  Anaxarchus's student Pyrrho is said to have adopted  \" a most noble philosophy, \u2026 taking the form of agnosticism and suspension of judgement. \" < ref > Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ''Lives'', ix. 61 < /ref >  Anaxarchus is said to have praised Pyrrho's  \" indifference and sang-froid. \" < ref > Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, ''Lives'', ix. 63 < /ref >  Anaxarchus is said to have possessed  \" fortitude and contentment in life, \"  which earned him the epithet ''eudaimonikos'' ( \" fortunate \" ), < ref name= \" La\u00ebrtius60 \" / >  which may imply that he held the end of life to be ''[[eudaimonia]].'' \n \n [[Plutarch]] reports that he told [[Alexander the Great]] that there were an infinite number of worlds, leading Alexander to weep, for he had not yet conquered even one. < ref > {{Cite book|last=Plutarch|title=De tranquillitate animi}} < /ref > \n \n ==References== \n {{reflist}} \n \n ==External links== \n *{{cite IEP |url-id=anaxarch |title=Anaxarchus |last=O'Keefe |first=Tim}} \n *{{ws|[[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]], ''[[s:Lives of the Eminent Philosophers/Book IX#Anaxarchus|Life of Anaxarchus]]'', translated by [[Robert Drew Hicks]] (1925)}} \n \n {{Authority control}} \n \n {{DEFAULTSORT:Anaxarchus}} \n [[Category:4th-century BC Greek people]] \n [[Category:4th-century BC philosophers]] \n [[Category:Abderites]] \n [[Category:Ancient Greek atomist philosophers]] \n [[Category:Ancient Thracian Greeks]] \n [[Category:Hellenistic-era philosophers]] \n [[Category:Philosophers and tutors of Alexander the Great]] \n [[Category:Ancient Skeptic philosophers]] \n [[Category:Executed philosophers]] \n [[Category:Pyrrhonism]]"
