With [[Isidore of Miletus]], he designed the [[Hagia Sophia]] for [[Justinian & nbsp;I]]. \n {{anchor|History|Biography}} \n \n ==Life== \n Anthemius was one of the five sons of Stephanus of Tralles, a physician. His brothers were Dioscorus, Alexander, Olympius, and Metrodorus. Dioscorus followed his father's profession in Tralles; Alexander did so in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and became one of the most celebrated medical men of his time; Olympius became a noted [[Roman law|lawyer]]; and Metrodorus worked as a [[Grammarian (Greco-Roman world)|grammarian]] in Constantinople.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=98}} \n \n Anthemius was said to have annoyed his neighbor Zeno in two ways: first, by engineering a miniature earthquake by sending steam through leather tubes he had fixed among the [[joist]]s and flooring of Zeno's parlor while he was entertaining friends and, second, by simulating [[thunder]] and [[lightning]] and flashing intolerable light into Zeno's eyes from a slightly hollowed mirror.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=98}} In addition to his familiarity with steam, some dubious authorities credited Anthemius with a knowledge of [[gunpowder]] or other explosive compound.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=98}} \n \n ==Mathematics== \n Anthemius was a capable [[Greek mathematics|mathematician]]. In the course of his treatise ''[[On Burning Mirrors]]'', he intended to facilitate the construction of surfaces to reflect light to a single point, he described the string construction of the [[ellipse]]{{sfnp|Boyer|1991|p=193}} and assumed a property of ellipses not found in [[Apollonius of Perga]]'s ''Conics'': the equality of the angles subtended at a focus by two tangents drawn from a point. His work also includes the first practical use of the [[directrix (conic section)|directrix]]: having given the focus and a double ordinate, he used the focus and directrix to obtain any number of points on a [[parabola]].{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=98}} This work was later known to [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematicians]] such as [[Book of Optics|Alhazen]]. \n \n Eutocius's commentary on Apollonius's ''Conics'' was dedicated to Anthemius.{{sfnp|Boyer|1991|p=193}} \n [[File:Hagia Sophia Mars 2013.jpg|thumb|120px|Exterior of the [[Hagia Sophia]], 2013]] \n \n ==Architecture== \n As an architect, Anthemius is best known for his work designing the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=98}} He was commissioned with [[Isidore of Miletus]] by [[Justinian & nbsp;I]] shortly after the earlier church on the site burned down in 532 but died early on in the project. He is also said to have repaired the flood defenses at [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Daras]]. < ref > http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Anthemius.html < /ref > \n \n ==See also== \n * [[Anthemius (disambiguation)|Other Anthemiuses]] \n \n ==Notes== \n {{reflist}} \n \n ==References== \n * {{citation |last=Boyer |first=Carl Benjamin |author-link=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=2nd |publisher=John Wiley  &  Sons |date=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmathema00boye }}. \n \n '''Attribution:''' \n * {{EB1911 |mode=cs2 |last=Heath |first=Thomas Little |author-link=Thomas Little Heath |wstitle=Anthemius |volume=2  |page=93 }} \n \n ==Further reading== \n * {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Anthemius |volume=2  |ref=none |page=103 }} \n * Editions of Anthemius's  \" On Burning-Glasses \" : \n :: {{citation |last=Dupuy |first=L. |title=''\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd [''Per\u00ed Parad\u00f3x\u014dn M\u0113khan\u0113m\u00e1t\u014dn; Concerning Wondrous Machines'']'' |date=1777 }}. {{in lang|el}} \n :: {{citation |title=Histoire de l'Academie des Instrumentistes |volume=XLII }}. {{in lang|fr}} \n :: {{citation |last=Westermann |first=A. |title=''\u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9 [''Paradoxogr\u00e1phoi; Marvel-Writers'']'' |date=1839 }}. {{in lang|el}} \n \n == External links == \n * {{citation |contribution=Anthemius of Tralles |title=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography |date=2008 |contribution-url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830900120.html }}. \n * {{MacTutor Biography|id=Anthemius}} \n \n {{Ancient Greek mathematics}} \n \n {{Authority control}} \n \n [[Category:470s births]] \n [[Category:Byzantine architects]] \n [[Category:6th-century Byzantine people]] \n [[Category:5th-century mathematicians]] \n [[Category:6th-century mathematicians]] \n [[Category:Greek Christians]] \n [[Category:People from Tralles]] \n [[Category:Justinian I]] \n [[Category:6th-century deaths]] \n [[Category:5th-century Byzantine people]] \n [[Category:5th-century Byzantine scientists]] \n [[Category:6th-century Byzantine scientists]] \n [[Category:6th-century Byzantine writers]] \n [[Category:Ancient Greek architects]]"
