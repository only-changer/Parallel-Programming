They are found in tropical [[South America]]. Four [[species]] are currently recognized. \n \n ==Description== \n Although the name applies to a group of snakes, it is often used to refer only to one species, in particular, the common or [[green anaconda]] (''Eunectes murinus''), which is the largest snake in the world by weight, and the second longest. \n \n ==Etymology== \n The South American names ''anacauchoa'' and ''anacaona'' were suggested in an account by [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]], but the idea of a South American origin was questioned by [[Henry Walter Bates]] who, in his travels in South America, failed to find any similar name in use. The word anaconda is derived from the name of a snake from Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]) that [[John Ray]] described in Latin in his ''Synopsis Methodica Animalium'' (1693) as ''serpens indicus bubalinus anacandaia zeylonibus, ides bubalorum aliorumque jumentorum membra conterens''. < ref > {{cite book|last=Ray|first=John|author-link=John Ray|year=1693|title=Synopsis methodica animalium quadrupedum et serpentini generis|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/28832440|page=332|language=la|publisher=Impensis S.

Edwin. Edwin described a '[[tiger]]' being crushed to death by an anaconda, when there actually never were any tigers in Sri Lanka.{{efn|In [[South Asia]]n languages like Hindi, the [[leopard]] and [[tiger]] may share the same name, that is ''B\u00e1gh'' ({{lang-hi|\u092c\u093e\u0918}}), and it is the former that occurs in Sri Lanka. < ref name= \" Pocock1930 \" > {{cite journal |last=Pocock |first=Reginald I. |author-link=Reginald Innes Pocock |title=The Panthers and Ounces of Asia |journal=Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society |volume=34 |issue=2 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48295762 |pages=307\u2013336 |year=1930 |via=Biodiversity Heritage Library}} < /ref > }} Yule and [[Frank Wall (herpetologist)|Frank Wall]] noted that the snake was in fact a python and suggested a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] origin ''anai-kondra'' meaning elephant killer. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Wall |first=Frank |author-link=Frank Wall (herpetologist) |year=1921 |title=Ophidia Taprobanica or the Snakes of Ceylon |publisher=H.
