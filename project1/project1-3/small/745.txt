Goals can be explicitly defined or induced. If the AI is programmed for  \" [[reinforcement learning]] \" , goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.{{efn|The act of doling out rewards can itself be formalized or automated into a  \" [[reward function]] \" .}} Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a  \" [[fitness function]] \"  to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 5}} Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 7}} Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose  \" goal \"  is to  accomplish its narrow classification task. < ref > Lindenbaum, M., Markovitch, S.,  &  Rusakov, D. (2004). Selective sampling for nearest neighbor classifiers. Machine learning, 54(2), 125\u2013152. < /ref > \n \n AI often revolves around the use of [[algorithms]]. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.{{efn|Terminology varies; see [[algorithm characterizations]].}} A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) recipe for play at [[tic-tac-toe]]:{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 1}} \n \n # If someone has a  \" threat \"  (that is, two in a row), take the remaining square. Otherwise, \n # if a move  \" forks \"  to create two threats at once, play that move. Otherwise, \n # take the center square if it is free. Otherwise, \n # if your opponent has played in a corner, take the opposite corner. Otherwise, \n # take an empty corner if one exists. Otherwise, \n # take any empty square. \n \n Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] (strategies, or  \" rules of thumb \" , that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms. Some of the  \" learners \"  described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate any [[function (mathematics)|function]], including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} These learners could therefore derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data. In practice, it is seldom possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of  \" [[combinatorial explosion]] \" , where the time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering a broad range of possibilities unlikely to be beneficial. < ref name= \" Intractability \"  / > {{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 3}} For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from [[Denver]] to [[New York City|New York]] in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through [[San Francisco]] or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm like [[A* search algorithm|A*]] can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered. < ref > {{cite journal |first=P.

A second, more general, approach is [[Bayesian inference]]:  \" If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way \" . The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as [[Support vector machine|SVM]] and [[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|nearest-neighbor]]:  \" After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza \" . A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain's machinery works: the [[artificial neural network]] approach uses artificial  \" [[neurons]] \"  that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to  \" reinforce \"  connections that seemed to be useful. These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies. Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms; the best approach is often different depending on the problem.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 4, Chapter 6}} < !-- The influenza example is expanded from Domingos chapter 6; feel free to put in a better example if you have one -- > < ref > {{cite news|title=Can neural network computers learn from experience, and if so, could they ever become what we would call 'smart'?|work=Scientific American|date=2018 |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-neural-network-comput/|access-date=24 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325045717/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-neural-network-comput/ |archive-date=25 March 2018|url-status=live}} < /ref > \n \n Learning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future. These inferences can be obvious, such as  \" since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well \" . They can be nuanced, such as  \" X% of [[Family (biology)|families]] have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered [[black swan theory|black swans]] exist \" . Learners also work on the basis of  \" [[Occam's razor#Probability theory and statistics|Occam's razor]] \" : The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest. Therefore, according to Occam's razor principle, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better. \n \n [[File:Overfitted Data.png|thumb|The blue line could be an example of [[overfitting]] a linear function due to random noise.]] \n Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as [[overfitting]]. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 6, Chapter 7}} Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by  \" learning the wrong lesson \" . A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=286}} A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often don't primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in  \" adversarial \"  images that the system misclassifies.{{efn|Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations.

What would have been otherwise straightforward, an equivalently difficult problem may be challenging to solve computationally as opposed to using the human mind. This gives rise to two classes of models: structuralist and functionalist. The structural models aim to loosely mimic the basic intelligence operations of the mind such as reasoning and logic.

For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture a fist-sized animal that sings and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] identified this problem in 1969 < ref name= \" Qualification problem \"  / >  as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem. < ref name= \" Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic \"  / > \n ;Breadth of commonsense knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large.

For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it  \" feels too exposed \" {{sfn|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}} or an art critic can take one look at a statue and realize that it is a fake.{{sfn|Gladwell|2005}} These are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain. < ref name= \" Intuition \"  / >  Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge.

Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. < ref name= \" Machine learning \"  / >  Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as  \" function approximators \"  trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories,  \" spam \"  or  \" not spam \" .

Or is [[human biology]] as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to [[aeronautical engineering]]? < ref name= \" Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general \"  / > \n Can intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as [[logic]] or [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]])? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of unrelated problems? < ref name= \" Neats vs. scruffies \"  / > \n \n === Cybernetics and brain simulation === \n {{Main|Cybernetics|Computational neuroscience}} \n In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between [[neurobiology]], [[information theory]], and [[cybernetics]]. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as [[W. Grey Walter]]'s [[turtle (robot)|turtles]] and the [[Johns Hopkins Beast]]. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Ratio Club]] in England. < ref name= \" AI's immediate precursors \"  / >  By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s. \n \n === Symbolic === \n {{Main|Symbolic AI}} \n When access to digital computers became possible in the mid-1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Stanford]], and [[MIT]], and as described below, each one developed its own style of research. [[John Haugeland]] named these symbolic approaches to AI  \" good old fashioned AI \"  or  \" [[GOFAI]] \" . < ref name= \" GOFAI \"  / >  During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level  \" thinking \"  in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on [[cybernetics]] or [[artificial neural network]]s were abandoned or pushed into the background.{{efn|The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of [[perceptron]]s by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]] in 1969. See [[History of AI]], [[AI winter]], or [[Frank Rosenblatt]].{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}}} \n Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with [[artificial general intelligence]] and considered this the goal of their field. \n \n ==== Cognitive simulation ==== \n Economist [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as [[cognitive science]], [[operations research]] and [[management science]]. Their research team used the results of [[psychology|psychological]] experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] would eventually culminate in the development of the [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] architecture in the middle 1980s. < ref name= \" AI at CMU in the 60s \"  / > < ref name= \" Soar \"  / > \n \n ==== Logic-based ==== \n Unlike Simon and Newell, [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem-solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms. < ref name= \" Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general \"  / >  His laboratory at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] ([[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|SAIL]]) focused on using formal [[logic]] to solve a wide variety of problems, including [[knowledge representation]], [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] and [[machine learning|learning]]. < ref name= \" AI at Stanford in the 60s \"  / >  Logic was also the focus of the work at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language [[Prolog]] and the science of [[logic programming]]. < ref name= \" AI at Edinburgh and France in the 60s \"  / > \n \n ==== Anti-logic or scruffy ==== \n Researchers at [[MIT]] (such as [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]]) < ref name= \" AI at MIT in the 60s \"  / >  found that solving difficult problems in [[computer vision|vision]] and [[natural language processing]] required ad hoc solutions\u2014they argued that no simple and general principle (like [[logic]]) would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. [[Roger Schank]] described their  \" anti-logic \"  approaches as  \" [[Neats vs. scruffies|scruffy]] \"  (as opposed to the  \" [[neats vs. scruffies|neat]] \"  paradigms at [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]] and Stanford). < ref name= \" Neats vs. scruffies \"  / >  [[Commonsense knowledge bases]] (such as [[Doug Lenat]]'s [[Cyc]]) are an example of  \" scruffy \"  AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time. < ref name= \" Cyc \"  / > \n \n ==== Knowledge-based ==== \n When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build [[knowledge representation|knowledge]] into AI applications. < ref name= \" Knowledge revolution \"  / >  This  \" knowledge revolution \"  led to the development and deployment of [[expert system]]s (introduced by [[Edward Feigenbaum]]), the first truly successful form of AI software. < ref name= \" Expert systems \"  / >  A key component of the system architecture for all expert systems is the knowledge base, which stores facts and rules that illustrate AI. < ref > {{Cite journal |last1=Frederick |first1=Hayes-Roth |last2=William |first2=Murray |last3=Leonard |first3=Adelman |title=Expert systems|journal=AccessScience |language=en |doi=10.1036/1097-8542.248550}} < /ref >  The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications. \n \n === Sub-symbolic === \n By the 1980s, progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially [[machine perception|perception]], robotics, [[machine learning|learning]] and [[pattern recognition]]. A number of researchers began to look into  \" sub-symbolic \"  approaches to specific AI problems. < ref name= \" Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic \"  / >  Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge. \n \n ==== Embodied intelligence ==== \n This includes [[embodied agent|embodied]], [[situated]], [[behavior-based AI|behavior-based]], and [[nouvelle AI]]. Researchers from the related field of robotics, such as [[Rodney Brooks]], rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive. < ref name= \" Embodied AI \"  / >  Their work revived the non-symbolic point of view of the early [[cybernetic]]s researchers of the 1950s and reintroduced the use of [[control theory]] in AI. This coincided with the development of the [[embodied mind thesis]] in the related field of [[cognitive science]]: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence. \n \n Within [[developmental robotics]], developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social interaction with human teachers, and the use of guidance mechanisms (active learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.).{{sfn|Weng|McClelland|Pentland|Sporns|2001}}{{sfn|Lungarella|Metta|Pfeifer|Sandini|2003}}{{sfn|Asada|Hosoda|Kuniyoshi|Ishiguro|2009}}{{sfn|Oudeyer|2010}} \n \n ==== Computational intelligence and soft computing ==== \n Interest in [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and  \" [[connectionism]] \"  was revived by [[David Rumelhart]] and others in the middle of the 1980s. < ref name= \" Revival of connectionism \"  / >  [[Artificial neural network]]s are an example of [[soft computing]]\u2014they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often sufficient. Other [[soft computing]] approaches to AI include [[fuzzy system]]s, [[Grey system theory]], [[evolutionary computation]] and many statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of [[computational intelligence]]. < ref name= \" Computational intelligence \"  / > \n \n === Statistical === \n Much of traditional [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|GOFAI]] got bogged down on ''ad hoc'' patches to [[symbolic computation]] that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results. However, around the 1990s, AI researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools, such as [[hidden Markov model]]s (HMM), [[information theory]], and normative Bayesian [[decision theory]] to compare or to unify competing architectures. The shared mathematical language permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like [[mathematics]], economics or [[operations research]]).{{efn|While such a  \" victory of the neats \"  may be a consequence of the field becoming more mature, [[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|AIMA]] states that in practice both [[neats and scruffies|neat and scruffy]] approaches continue to be necessary in AI research.}} Compared with GOFAI, new  \" statistical learning \"  techniques such as HMM and neural networks were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as [[data mining]], without necessarily acquiring a semantic understanding of the datasets. The increased successes with real-world data led to increasing emphasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy models; AI research was becoming more [[scientific method|scientific]].

In AGI research, some scholars caution against over-reliance on statistical learning, and argue that continuing research into GOFAI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence.{{sfn|Langley|2011}}{{sfn|Katz|2012}} \n \n === Integrating the approaches === \n ;Intelligent agent paradigm: An [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as [[firm]]s). The paradigm allows researchers to directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given  \" goal function \" . An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works\u2014some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic [[artificial neural network]]s and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields\u2014such as [[decision theory]] and economics\u2014that also use concepts of abstract agents. Building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration; for example, because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment, planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s. < ref name= \" Intelligent agents \"  / > \n \n ;[[Agent architecture]]s and [[cognitive architecture]]s:Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting [[intelligent agent]]s in a [[multi-agent system]]. < ref name= \" Agent architectures \"  / >  A [[hierarchical control system]] provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modeling. < ref name= \" Hierarchical control system \"  / >  Some cognitive architectures are custom-built to solve a narrow problem; others, such as [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]], are designed to mimic human cognition and to provide insight into general intelligence.

In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems\u2014it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics. \" < ref name= \" autogenerated2 \"  / >  Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality.

Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth. \n \n One proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is '[[Friendly AI]]' and will be able to control subsequently developed AIs. Some question whether this kind of check could actually remain in place. \n \n Leading AI researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] writes,  \" I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years.

This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness, generally referred to as the [[hard problem of consciousness]]. \n \n ==== Consciousness ==== \n {{Main|Hard problem of consciousness|Theory of mind}} \n [[David Chalmers]] identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the  \" hard \"  and  \" easy \"  problems of consciousness. < ref > {{cite journal |url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |title=Facing up to the problem of consciousness |last=Chalmers |first=David |author-link=David Chalmers |journal=[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]] |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=1995 |pages=200\u2013219 |access-date=11 October 2018 |archive-date=8 March 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308163649/http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |url-status=live }} See also [http://consc.net/papers/facing.html this link] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408224800/http://consc.net/papers/facing.html |date=8 April 2011 }} < /ref >  The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this ''feels'' or why it should feel like anything at all. Human [[information processing]] is easy to explain, however human [[subjective experience]] is difficult to explain. \n \n For example, consider what happens when a person is shown a color swatch and identifies it, saying  \" it's red \" . The easy problem only requires understanding the machinery in the brain that makes it possible for a person to know that the color swatch is red. The hard problem is that people also know something else\u2014they also know ''what red looks like''. (Consider that a person born blind can know that something is red without knowing what red looks like.){{efn|This is based on [[Mary's Room]], a thought experiment first proposed by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] in 1982}} Everyone knows subjective experience exists, because they do it every day (e.g., all sighted people know what red looks like). The hard problem is explaining how the brain creates it, why it exists, and how it is different from knowledge and other aspects of the brain. \n \n ==== Computationalism and functionalism ==== \n {{Main|Computationalism|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}} \n Computationalism is the position in the [[philosophy of mind]] that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. < ref > [[Steven Horst|Horst, Steven]], (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/  \" The Computational Theory of Mind \" ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911043901/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/ |date=11 September 2018 }} in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' < /ref >  Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the [[mind-body problem]]. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]]. \n \n ==== Strong AI hypothesis ==== \n {{Main|Chinese room}} \n The philosophical position that [[John Searle]] has named [[strong AI hypothesis| \" strong AI \" ]] states:  \" The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds. \" {{efn|name= \" Searle's strong AI \" |This version is from {{Harvtxt|Searle|1999}}, and is also quoted in {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|p=435}}. Searle's original formulation was  \" The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states. \" {{sfn|Searle|1980|p=1}} Strong AI is defined similarly by {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}:  \" The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis. \" }} Searle counters this assertion with his [[Chinese room]] argument, which asks us to look ''inside'' the computer and try to find where the  \" mind \"  might be. < ref name= \" Chinese room \"  / > \n \n ==== Robot rights ==== \n {{Main|Robot rights}} \n If a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also ''[[sentience|feel]]''?

He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit [[Instrumental convergence|convergent]] behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI's goals do not fully reflect humanity's\u2014one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible\u2014it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.  Bostrom also emphasizes the difficulty of fully conveying humanity's values to an advanced AI.  He uses the hypothetical example of giving an AI the goal to make humans smile to illustrate a misguided attempt.  If the AI in that scenario were to become superintelligent, Bostrom argues, it may resort to methods that most humans would find horrifying, such as inserting  \" electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins \"  because that would be an efficient way to achieve its goal of making humans smile. < ref > {{cite web|last=Bostrom|first=Nick|date=2015|title=What happens when our computers get smarter than we are?|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_what_happens_when_our_computers_get_smarter_than_we_are/transcript|publisher=[[TED (conference)]]|access-date=30 January 2020|archive-date=25 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725005719/https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_what_happens_when_our_computers_get_smarter_than_we_are/transcript|url-status=live}} < /ref >   In his book ''[[Human Compatible]]'', AI researcher [[Stuart J.

Sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always an unnatural product of the human mind, a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form. \n \n Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have [[sentience|the ability to feel]], and thus to suffer.
