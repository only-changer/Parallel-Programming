She was syncretized with the Roman goddess {{lang|la|[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]}}. Aphrodite's major symbols include [[Myrtle (common)|myrtles]], [[rose]]s, [[dove]]s, [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s, and [[swan]]s. The cult of Aphrodite was largely derived from that of the [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Phoenician goddess]] [[Astarte]], a [[cognate]] of the [[East Semitic]] goddess [[Ishtar]], whose cult was based on the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian cult]] of [[Inanna]]. Aphrodite's main cult centers were [[Kythira|Cythera]], [[Cyprus]], [[Corinth]], and [[Athens]]. Her main festival was the [[Aphrodisia]], which was celebrated annually in midsummer. In [[Laconia]], Aphrodite was worshipped as a warrior goddess. She was also the patron goddess of [[Prostitution in ancient Greece|prostitutes]], an association which led early scholars to propose the concept of  \" [[sacred prostitution]] \"  in Greco-Roman culture, an idea which is now generally seen as erroneous. \n \n In [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Aphrodite is born off the coast of Cythera from the foam (''{{Lang|el|\u03b1\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 aphr\u00f3s}}'') produced by [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]'s genitals, which his son [[Cronus]] has [[castration|severed]] and thrown into the sea. In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', however, she is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Dione (Titaness/Oceanid)|Dione]]. [[Plato]], in his ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' 180e, asserts that these two origins actually belong to separate entities: [[Aphrodite Urania|Aphrodite Ourania]] (a transcendent,  \" Heavenly \"  Aphrodite) and [[Aphrodite Pandemos]] (Aphrodite common to  \" all the people \" ). Aphrodite had many other [[epithet]]s, each emphasizing a different aspect of the same goddess, or used by a different local cult. Thus she was also known as '''Cytherea''' (''Lady of Cythera'') and '''Cypris''' (''Lady of Cyprus''), because both locations claimed to be the place of her birth. \n \n In [[Greek mythology]], Aphrodite was married to [[Hephaestus]], the god of fire, blacksmiths and metalworking. Aphrodite was frequently [[adultery|unfaithful]] to him and had many lovers; in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', she is caught in the act of adultery with [[Ares]], the god of war. In the ''[[Homeric Hymns|First Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite]]'', she seduces the mortal shepherd [[Anchises]]. Aphrodite was also the surrogate mother and lover of the mortal shepherd [[Adonis]], who was killed by a [[wild boar]]. Along with [[Athena]] and [[Hera]], Aphrodite was one of the three goddesses [[Judgement of Paris|whose feud]] resulted in the beginning of the [[Trojan War]] and she plays a major role throughout the ''[[Iliad]]''. Aphrodite has been featured in [[Art of Europe|Western art]] as a symbol of [[Physical attractiveness#Female physical attractiveness|female beauty]] and has appeared in numerous works of [[Western literature]]. She is a major deity in modern [[Modern Paganism|Neopagan religions]], including the [[Church of Aphrodite]], [[Wicca]], and [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenismos]]. \n \n == Etymology == \n [[Hesiod]] derives ''Aphrodite'' from {{Lang|grc-latn|aphr\u00f3s}} ({{Lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2}})  \" sea-foam \" ,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=14}} interpreting the name as  \" risen from the foam \" , < ref > Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'', [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+173 190\u2013197]. < /ref > {{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=14}} but most modern scholars regard this as a spurious [[folk etymology]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=14}}{{sfn|West|2000|pages=134\u2013138}} Early modern scholars of classical mythology attempted to argue that Aphrodite's name was of Greek or [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin, but these efforts have now been mostly abandoned.{{sfn|West|2000|pages=134\u2013138}} Aphrodite's name is generally accepted to be of non-Greek, probably [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], origin, but its exact derivation cannot be determined.{{sfn|West|2000|pages=134\u2013138}}{{sfn|Beekes|2009|page=179}} \n \n Scholars in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, accepting Hesiod's  \" foam \"  etymology as genuine, analyzed the second part of Aphrodite's name as *''-od\u00edt\u0113''  \" wanderer \" < ref > [[Paul Kretschmer]],  \" Zum pamphylischen Dialekt \" , ''[[Historische Sprachforschung|Zeitschrift f\u00fcr vergleichende Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiet der Indogermanischen Sprachen]]'' 33 (1895): 267. < /ref >  or *''-d\u00edt\u0113''  \" bright \" . < ref > Ernst Maa\u00df,  \" Aphrodite und die hl.

classical scholars had a general aversion to the idea that ancient Greek religion was at all influenced by the cultures of the Near East,{{sfn|Konaris|2016|page=169}} but, even [[Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker]], who argued that Near Eastern influence on Greek culture was largely confined to material culture,{{sfn|Konaris|2016|page=169}} admitted that Aphrodite was clearly of Phoenician origin.{{sfn|Konaris|2016|page=169}} The significant influence of Near Eastern culture on early Greek religion in general, and on the cult of Aphrodite in particular,{{sfn|Burkert|1998|pages=1\u20136}} is now widely recognized as dating to a period of [[Orientalizing period|orientalization]] during the eighth century BC,{{sfn|Burkert|1998|pages=1\u20136}} when [[archaic Greece]] was on the fringes of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].{{sfn|Burkert|1998|pages=1\u201341}} \n \n ===Indo-European dawn goddess=== \n Some early [[comparative mythology|comparative mythologists]] opposed to the idea of a Near Eastern origin argued that Aphrodite originated as an aspect of the Greek dawn goddess [[Eos]]{{sfn|Dum\u00e9zil|1934|page=}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=24}} and that she was therefore ultimately derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European]] dawn goddess [[Hausos|*''H

Aphrodite,{{sfn|West|2000|pages=134\u2013138}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|pages=162\u2013164}}{{sfn|Boedeker|1974|pages=15\u201316}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=24\u201325}} but it is possible that Aphrodite, originally a [[Ancient Semitic religion|Semitic]] deity, may have been influenced by the Indo-European dawn goddess.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=24\u201325}} Both Aphrodite and Eos were known for their erotic beauty and aggressive sexuality{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=24}} and both had relationships with mortal lovers.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=24}} Both goddesses were associated with the colors red, white, and gold.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=24}} Michael Janda etymologizes Aphrodite's name as an epithet of Eos meaning  \" she who rises from the foam [of the ocean] \" {{sfn|Janda|2010|page=65}} and points to Hesiod's ''Theogony'' account of Aphrodite's birth as an archaic reflex of Indo-European myth.{{sfn|Janda|2010|page=65}} Aphrodite rising out of the waters after Cronus defeats Uranus as a mytheme would then be directly cognate to the [[Rig Veda|Rigvedic]] myth of [[Indra]] defeating [[Vrtra]], liberating [[Ushas]].{{sfn|Janda|2005|pages=349\u2013360}}{{sfn|Janda|2010|page=65}} Another key similarity between Aphrodite and the Indo-European dawn goddess is her close kinship to the Greek sky deity,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=24\u201325}} since both of the main claimants to her paternity (Zeus and Uranus) are sky deities.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=25}} \n \n ==Forms and epithets== \n {{multiple image \n | align     = right \n | direction = horizontal \n | header   =  \n | width     =  \n < !--

seduction.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=35\u201338}} The character of Pausanias in [[Plato]]'s [[Symposium (Plato)|''Symposium'']], takes differing cult-practices associated with different epithets of the goddess to claim that Ourania and Pandemos are, in fact, separate goddesses. He asserts that ''Aphrodite Ourania'' is the celestial Aphrodite, born from the sea foam after Cronus castrated Uranus, and the older of the two goddesses. According to the ''Symposium'', ''Aphrodite Ourania'' is the inspiration of [[Human male sexuality#Male homoeroticism|male homosexual desire]], specifically the [[Ephebic Oath|ephebic]] [[Eros (concept)|eros]], and [[pederasty]]. ''Aphrodite Pandemos'', by contrast, is the younger of the two goddesses: the common Aphrodite, born from the union of Zeus and Dione, and the inspiration of [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual desire]] and sexual promiscuity, the  \" lesser \"  of the two loves. < ref > [[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' 181a-d. < /ref > < ref > Richard L.

and tear their tunics.{{sfn|West|1997|pages=530\u2013531}} Later references flesh out the story with more details.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=95}} According to the retelling of the story found in the poem ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' by the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (43 BC \u2013 17/18 AD), [[Adonis]] was the son of [[Myrrha]], who was cursed by Aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father, King [[Cinyras]] of [[Cyprus]], after Myrrha's mother bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the goddess.{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=75}} Driven out after becoming pregnant, Myrrha was changed into a

killed her devoted follower [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=96}} The story also provides an [[etiology]] for Aphrodite's associations with certain flowers.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=96}} Reportedly, as she mourned Adonis's death, she caused [[anemone]]s to grow wherever his blood fell,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=96}} and declared a festival on the

have first become popular in Athens in the mid-fifth century BC.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} At the start of the festival, the women would plant a  \" garden of Adonis \" , a small garden planted inside a small basket or a shallow piece of broken pottery containing a variety of quick-growing plants, such as [[lettuce]] and [[fennel]], or even quick-sprouting grains such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} The women would then climb ladders to the roofs of their houses, where they would place the gardens out under the heat of the summer

portrays Aphrodite on the point of untying the laces of the sandal on her left foot, under which a small Eros squats, touching the sole of her shoe with his right hand. The Goddess is leaning with her left arm (the hand is missing) against a figure of Priapus standing, naked and bearded, positioned on a small cylindrical altar while, next to her left thigh, there is a tree trunk over which the garment of the Goddess is folded. Aphrodite, almost completely naked, wears only a sort of costume, consisting of a corset held up by two pairs of straps and two short sleeves on the upper part of her arm, from which a long chain leads to her hips and forms a star-shaped motif at the level of her navel. The 'bikini', for which the statuette is famous, is obtained by the masterly use of the technique of gilding, also employed on her groin, in the pendant necklace and in the armilla on Aphrodite's right wrist, as well as on Priapus' phallus. Traces of the red paint are evident on the tree trunk, on the short curly hair gathered back in a bun and on the lips of the Goddess, as well as on the heads of Priapus and the Eros. Aphrodite's eyes are made of glass paste, while the presence of holes at the level of the ear-lobes suggest the existence of precious metal ear-rings which have since been lost. An interesting insight into the female ornaments of Roman times, the statuette, probably imported from the area of Alexandria, reproduces with a few modifications the statuary type of Aphrodite untying her sandal, known from copies in bronze and terracotta.}} \n \n For extensive research and a bibliography on the subject, see: de Franciscis 1963, p. 78, tav.

Anadyomene|Aphrodite Anadyomene]]'' (''Aphrodite Rising from the Sea'').{{sfn|Havelock|2007|page=86}} According to [[Athenaeus]], Apelles was inspired to paint the painting after watching the courtesan [[Phryne]] take off her clothes, untie her hair, and bathe naked in the sea at [[Eleusis]].{{sfn|Havelock|2007|page=86}} The painting was displayed in the [[Asclepeion]] on the island of
