The Mon language is a recognized indigenous language in [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]]. In Myanmar, the [[Wa language]] is the de facto official language of [[Wa State]]. [[Santali language|Santali]] is one of the 22 [[Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India|scheduled languages of India]]. The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status. \n \n ''[[Ethnologue]]'' identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages. These form thirteen established families (plus perhaps [[Shompen language|Shompen]], which is poorly attested, as a fourteenth), which have traditionally been grouped into two, as Mon\u2013Khmer and [[Munda languages|Munda]]. However, one recent classification posits three groups (Munda, Nuclear Mon-Khmer and [[Khasi\u2013Palaungic languages|Khasi\u2013Khmuic]]), < ref > Diffloth 2005 < /ref >  while another has abandoned Mon\u2013Khmer as a taxon altogether, making it synonymous with the larger family. < ref > Sidwell 2009 < /ref > \n \n Austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across Southeast Asia and parts of India, Bangladesh, Nepal and East Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken. They appear to be the extant [[Indigenous language|autochthonous languages]] of Mainland Southeast Asia (excluding the [[Andaman Islands]]), with the neighboring [[Kra\u2013Dai languages|Kra\u2013Dai]], [[Hmong\u2013Mien languages|Hmong-Mien]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], and [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] being the result of later migrations. < ref name= \" SidwellBlench2011 \"  / > \n \n ==Etymology== \n The name ''Austroasiatic'' comes from a combination of the [[Latin]] words for  \" South \"  and  \" Asia \" , hence  \" South Asia \" . \n \n ==Typology== \n Regarding word structure, Austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic [[sesquisyllable| \" sesquisyllabic \" ]] pattern, with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial, unstressed, reduced [[minor syllable]] followed by a stressed, full syllable.{{sfn|Alves|2014|p=524}} This reduction of presyllables has led to a variety among modern languages of phonological shapes of the same original Proto-Austroasiatic prefixes, such as the causative prefix, ranging from CVC syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants.{{sfn|Alves|2014|p=526}} As for word formation, most Austroasiatic languages have a variety of derivational prefixes, many have [[infix]]es, but suffixes are almost completely non-existent in most branches except Munda, and a few specialized exceptions in other Austroasiatic branches. < ref > Alves 2014, 2015 < /ref > \n \n The Austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of [[Register (phonology)|register]] contrast, either between [[modal voice|modal]] (normal) voice and [[breathy voice|breathy]] (lax) voice or between modal voice and [[creaky voice]]. < ref > Diffloth, G\u00e9rard (1989). [http://www.sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/15:139-154.pdf  \" Proto-Austroasiatic creaky voice. \" ] < /ref >  Languages in the Pearic branch and some in the Vietic branch can have a three- or even four-way voicing contrast. \n \n However, some Austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases, such as Vietnamese, [[tonogenesis]]. Vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by Chinese that its original Austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of South Chinese languages, whereas Khmer, which had more influence from Sanskrit, has retained a more typically Austroasiatic structure. \n \n ==Proto-language== \n {{Main|Proto-Austroasiatic language}} \n Much work has been done on the reconstruction of [[Proto-Mon\u2013Khmer]] in [[Harry L. Shorto]]'s ''Mon\u2013Khmer Comparative Dictionary''. Little work has been done on the [[Munda languages]], which are not well documented. With their demotion from a primary branch, Proto-Mon\u2013Khmer becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic. Paul Sidwell (2005) reconstructs the consonant inventory of Proto-Mon\u2013Khmer as follows:{{sfnp|Sidwell|2005|p=196}} \n \n {| class= \" IPA wikitable \" \n |- \n | *p || *t || *c || *k || *\u0294 \n |- \n | *b || *d || *\u025f || *\u0261 || \n |- \n | *\u0253 || *\u0257 || *\u0284 || || \n |- \n | *m || *n || *\u0272 || *\u014b || \n |- \n | *w || *l, *r || *j || || \n |- \n | || *s || || || *h \n |} \n This is identical to earlier reconstructions except for {{IPA|*\u0284}}.  {{IPA|*\u0284}} is better preserved in the [[Katuic languages]], which Sidwell has specialized in. \n \n ==Internal classification== \n Linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austroasiatic: the [[Mon\u2013Khmer languages]] of [[Southeast Asia]], [[North-East India|Northeast India]] and the [[Nicobar Islands]], and the [[Munda languages]] of [[East India|East]] and [[Central India]] and parts of [[Bangladesh]], parts of [[Nepal]]. However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published. \n \n Each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade.{{clarify|date=February 2016}} By contrast, the relationships ''between'' these families within Austroasiatic are debated. In addition to the traditional classification, two recent proposals are given, neither of which accepts traditional  \" Mon\u2013Khmer \"  as a valid unit. However, little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review. \n \n In addition, there are suggestions that additional branches of Austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] in Sumatra (Diffloth), the [[Chamic languages]] of Vietnam, and the [[Land Dayak languages]] of Borneo (Adelaar 1995). < ref > Roger Blench, ''2009.

Sidwell  &  [[Roger Blench|Blench]] (2011) discuss this proposal in more detail, and note that there is good evidence for a Khasi\u2013Palaungic node, which could also possibly be closely related to Khmuic. < ref name= \" SidwellBlench2011 \" > Sidwell, Paul, and Roger Blench. 2011.  \" [http://rogerblench.info/Archaeology/SE%20Asia/SR09/Sidwell%20Blench%20offprint.pdf The Austroasiatic Urheimat: the Southeastern Riverine Hypothesis]. \"  Enfield, NJ (ed.)

Canberra: Pacific Linguistics. < /ref > \n \n If this would the case, Sidwell  &  Blench suggest that Khasic may have been an early offshoot of Palaungic that had spread westward. Sidwell  &  Blench (2011) suggest [[Shompen language|Shompen]] as an additional branch, and believe that a Vieto-Katuic connection is worth investigating. In general, however, the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed, since Proto-Austroasiatic speakers are believed by Sidwell to have radiated out from the central [[Mekong]] river valley relatively quickly. \n \n {{clade \n | label1=Austroasiatic: {{nobreak|Mon\u2013Khmer}} \n | 1={{clade \n | 1=[[Munda languages|Munda]] \n | label2= & nbsp;Khasi\u2013Palaungic & nbsp; \n | 2={{clade \n | 1=[[Khasic languages|Khasian]] \n | 2=[[Palaungic languages|Palaungic]] \n }} \n | 3=[[Khmuic languages|Khmuic]] \n | 4=[[Mangic languages|Mangic]] \n | 6=[[Vietic languages|Vietic]] \n | 7=[[Katuic languages|Katuic]] \n | 8=[[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]] \n | 9=[[Khmer language|Khmer]] \n | 10=[[Pearic languages|Pearic]] \n | 11=[[Monic languages|Monic]] \n | 12=[[Aslian languages|Aslian]] \n | 13=[[Nicobarese languages|Nicobarese]] \n | 14=?[[Shompen language|Shompen]] \n }} \n }} \n \n Subsequently, Sidwell (2015a: 179) < ref > Sidwell, Paul. 2015a.  \" Austroasiatic classification. \"  In Jenny, Mathias and Paul Sidwell, eds (2015).

Austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] watershed of [[Lingnan]], which would have been either a coastal route down the coast of Vietnam, or downstream through the [[Mekong River]] via [[Yunnan]]. < ref name= \" Sidwell2015 \" / >  Both the reconstructed lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic and the archaeological record clearly show that early Austroasiatic speakers around 4,000 B.P. cultivated rice and [[millet]], kept livestock such as dogs, pigs, and chickens, and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments. < ref name= \" Sidwell2015 \" / > \n \n At 4,500 B.P., this  \" Neolithic package \"  suddenly arrived in Indochina from the Lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer cultures, with grain husks found in northern Indochina by 4,100 B.P. and in southern Indochina by 3,800 B.P. < ref name= \" Sidwell2015 \" / >  However, Sidwell (2015c) found that iron is not reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic, since each Austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from Tai, Chinese, Tibetan, Malay, and other languages. \n \n During the [[Iron Age]] about 2,500 B.P., relatively young Austroasiatic branches in Indochina such as [[Vietic languages|Vietic]], [[Katuic languages|Katuic]], [[Pearic languages|Pearic]], and [[Khmer language|Khmer]] were formed, while the more internally diverse [[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]] branch (dating to about 3,000 B.P.) underwent more extensive internal diversification. < ref name= \" Sidwell2015 \" / >  By the Iron Age, all of the Austroasiatic branches were more or less in their present-day locations, with most of the diversification within Austroasiatic taking place during the Iron Age. < ref name= \" Sidwell2015 \" / > \n \n Paul Sidwell (2018) < ref > Sidwell, Paul. 2018.

Paper presented at the 28th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society, held 17\u201319 May 2018 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. < /ref >  considers the Austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around 4,000 years B.P. during the arrival of rice agriculture in Indochina, but notes that the origin of Proto-Austroasiatic itself is older than that date. The lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum. The early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts, animal names, natural features, and pronouns, while the names of cultural items (agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts, which are reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic) form part of the later stratum. \n \n [[Roger Blench]] (2017) < ref name= \" Blench2017 \" > Blench, Roger. 2017. ''[http://southasiabibliography.de/uploads/Blench.pdf Waterworld: lexical evidence for aquatic subsistence strategies in Austroasiatic]''. Presented at ICAAL 7, Kiel, Germany. < /ref >  suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies (such as boats, waterways, river fauna, and fish capture techniques) can be reconstructed for Proto-Austroasiatic. Blench (2017) finds widespread Austroasiatic roots for 'river, valley', 'boat', 'fish', 'catfish sp.', 'eel', 'prawn', 'shrimp' (Central Austroasiatic), 'crab', 'tortoise', 'turtle', 'otter', 'crocodile', 'heron, fishing bird', and 'fish trap'. Archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern [[Indochina]] (northern Vietnam, Laos, and other nearby areas) dates back to only about 4,000 years B.P. (2,000 BC), with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the Yangtze valley where it has been dated to 6,000 B.P. < ref name= \" Blench2017 \" / > \n \n Hence, this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of Austroasiatic as compared to [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], whose speakers had a distinct non-riverine culture. In addition to living an aquatic-based lifestyle, early Austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock, crops, and newer types of watercraft. As early Austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways, they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area, such as Sino-Tibetan. < ref name= \" Blench2017 \" / > \n \n === Possible extinct branches === \n [[Roger Blench]] (2009) < ref > Blench, Roger. 2009.  \" [http://icaal.org/abstract/blench-are.html Are there four additional unrecognised branches of Austroasiatic?]. \" < /ref >  also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of Austroasiatic that are now extinct, based on [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrate]] evidence in modern-day languages. \n * '''Pre-[[Chamic language|Chamic]] languages''' (the languages of coastal Vietnam before the Chamic migrations).

The  \" southern East Asian \"  component descended from a  \" basal East Asian \"  source population, which also gave rise to the  \" northern East Asian \"  component of East and Northeast Asia. From Mainland Southeast Asia, the Austroasiatic-speakers expanded into the Indian-subcontinent and [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. There is evidence that continuing migration of agriculturalists from more northerly East Asia merged with the  \" southern East Asians \" , forming modern day Southeast Asians, and contributed to the fragmentation observed among modern day Austroasiatic-speakers. Similarly, Austroasiatic-speakers in India intermixed with local tribals. The authors also found that the ancient [[Hoabinhian]] people likely spoke a variant of [[Proto-Austroasiatic language|Proto-Austroasiatic]], and had largely  \" southern East Asian ancestry \" . They concluded that their new genetic evidence does not support a partial relationship between Hoabinhians and [[Andamanese peoples|Andamanese (Onge)]]/[[Papuans]], as suggested by Mc.Coll 2018, but in contrary, points to genetic influence (geneflow) of  \" southern East Asians \"  towards the Onge/Andamanese (previous studies estimated about 32% East Asian-related ancestry in Andamanese people). Additionally, it was found that East Asian-like ancestry (East-Eurasian, including both  \" southern East Asian \"  and  \" northern East Asian \"  components) originated likely in Mainland Southeast Asia and southern China, and expanded from this region towards the South and North respectively. The authors finally concluded that genetics do not necessarily correspond with linguistic identity, pointing to the fragmentation of modern Austroasiatic-speakers. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Tagore|first=Debashree|last2=Aghakhanian|first2=Farhang|last3=Naidu|first3=Rakesh|last4=Phipps|first4=Maude E.|last5=Basu|first5=Analabha|date=2021-03-29|title=Insights into the demographic history of Asia from common ancestry and admixture in the genomic landscape of present-day Austroasiatic speakers|url= |journal=BMC Biology|volume=19|issue=1|pages=61|doi=10.1186/s12915-021-00981-x|issn=1741-7007|pmc=8008685|pmid=33781248|quote=McColl et al. suggested that ancient SEA hunter-gatherers (H\u00f2ab\u00ecnhian) share some ancestry with the Onge, Jehai, Papuan, and Indian populations.

Contrary to their claim, we found no evidence of Onge, Jarawa, and Papuan ancestries in the ANC samples (results of ADMIXTURE run hence not shown). We regressed the AAI ancestry (and the EA-like ancestry) of the ancient genomes jointly on the age of the sample and the latitude where these samples were found (Supplementary Table 7). While latitude was only marginally significant for the AAI-like ancestry, it was extremely significant for EA-like ancestry, showing a decreasing trend of EA-like ancestry as one moves from North to South (Fig. 6e, Supplementary Figure 14 in Additional file 1).
