God alone is, for Arius, without beginning, unbegotten and eternal. In the terminology of negative theology, Arius stresses monotheism with ever-renewed attempts. God can only be understood as creator. He denies the co-eternal state of the Logos with God since otherwise God would be stripped of his absolute uniqueness. God alone is, and thus he was not always Father. [...] Following Proverbs 8:22\u201325, Arius is able to argue that the Son was created. For Arius the Logos belongs wholly on the side of the Divine, but he is markedly subordinate to God. [...] The strong support that Arius received outside of the Egyptian metropolis, and from a whole series of prominent bishops, proves that in this historical situation, the theological ideas of Arius were not especially unusual. [...] According to Alexander, Arius has assigned the Logos a place among created beings (which Arius explicitly denies); from that, he draws the conclusion that the Son/Logos of Arius is merely a man. < sup > 47 < /sup >  [...] This view is still to be found in the realm of popular scholarship and most recently led to the idea that \u2018Arianism\u2019, as a theology without a doctrine of the Trinity that sees Christ merely as a man, could form a possible bridge to Islam. [...] After the Synod of Nicaea, the debate shifted and became a debate over unity and trinity in the Trinitarian notion of God \u2013 a debate which is considered, unjustly, to be a further \u2018Arian controversy\u2019. [...] Only after researchers began to position Arius within the Origenist tradition, did it become possible to see that the development after Nicaea was not a conflict between \u2018Nicenes\u2019 and \u2018Arians\u2019, as common opinion claimed, but rather a debate on the nature of divine hypostasis \u2013 in particular, on the question whether it was appropriate to speak of one single or three distinct hypostases. A detailed discussion of the complicated sequence of events in this conflict from the beginning of the 330s through the 380s and individual portrayals of the key protagonists would, however, be beyond the scope of this chapter. < sup > 68 < /sup > < ref name= \" Steinacher2 \" / > }} < ref > {{Cite encyclopedia |title=Arianism |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Arianism}} < /ref > {{efn| A [[Heresy in Christianity|heresy]] of the [[State church of the Roman Empire|Christian Church]], started by Arius, bishop of Alexandria (d. 336), who taught that the Son is not equivalent to the Father (''\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2'' gr:''homoousios'' \u2245 lt:''consubstantialis''), thereby provoking a serious schism in the Christian Church, which in turn affected the [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|fortunes of the Jews]] in many countries. In view of the fact that most [[Germanic peoples]] \u2014 such as the eastern and western [[Goths]], as also the [[Franks]], the [[Lombards]], the [[Suebi|Suevi]], and the [[Vandals]] \u2014 were baptized into Arian Christianity, and that these tribes settled in widely spread districts of the old Roman empire, a large number of Jews, already resident in those lands, fell under Arian domination. In contrast with the domination of the orthodox church, the Arian was distinguished by a wise tolerance and a mild treatment of the population of other faiths, conduct mainly attributable to the unsophisticated sense of justice characterizing the children of nature, but also traceable in some degree to certain points of agreement between the Arian doctrine and Judaism, points totally absent in the orthodox confession. The very insistence upon the more subordinate relationship of the Son \u2014 that is, the Messiah \u2014 to God-the-father is much nearer to the [[Messiah in Judaism|Jewish doctrine of the Messiah]] than to the conception of the full divinity of the Son, as enunciated at [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]]. < ref name= \" JE2 \" / > }} who was begotten by [[God the Father]]. < ref name= \" Steinacher2 \" / >   \n \n The term ''Arian'' is derived from the name Arius and, like the term ''Christian'', it was not what they called themselves, but rather a [[Exonym and endonym|term used by outsiders]]. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Wiles |first=Maurice |title=Archetypal heresy : Arianism through the centuries |date=1996 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=9780191520594 |location=Oxford |pages=5 |oclc=344023364}} < /ref >  The nature of Arius's teachings and his supporters were opposed to the theological views held by [[Homoousian]] Christians, regarding the nature of the Trinity and the nature of Christ.

War, for example, was not a simple matter of a test of strength and courage, but supernatural matters had to be taken carefully into consideration. When [[Clovis I|Clovis]] said of the Goths in southern Gaul, 'I take it hard that these Arians should hold a part of the Gauls; let us go with God's aid and conquer them and bring the land under our dominion', [note: see p. 45 (Book II:37)] he was not speaking in a hypocritical or arrogant manner but in real accordance with the religious sentiment of the time. What he meant was that the Goths, being heretics, were at once enemies of the true God and inferior to the orthodox Franks in their supernatural backing. Considerations of duty, strategy, and self-interest all reinforced one another in Clovis's mind. However, it was not always the orthodox side that won.

Latter-day Saint theology also teaches that Christ is equal in nature, power, and glory with the Father, but has achieved this through subordinating his will to the will of the Father. However, Christ's existence is not contingent on the Father and he is not ontologically subordinate to the Father, as in Arianism. The Father is in turn understood to have his power only by virtue of his own perfect character and subordination to eternal and uncreated principles of righteousness, with the Book of Mormon stating in Alma 42:13 that were God not to be perfectly just then  \" God would cease to be God \" . Thus, Christ's subordination to the Father's will is understood as subordination to those same eternal and uncreated principles of righteousness through perfectly emulating the Father's character and example. < ref > [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/revelations-in-context/man-was-also-in-the-beginning-with-god?lang=eng] < /ref > \n \n The LDS Church's view of the [[God in Mormonism|Godhead]] breaks with [[Nicene Creed]] tradition and believes it returns to the teachings taught by Jesus.
