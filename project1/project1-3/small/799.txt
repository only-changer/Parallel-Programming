The ABC innovations included electronic computation, binary arithmetic, [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]], [[regenerative capacitor memory]], and a separation of memory and computing functions. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/computer-hist-web.htm|title=The History of Computing|website=mason.gmu.edu|access-date=6 April 2018}} < /ref >  The mechanical and logic design was worked out by Atanasoff over the next year. A grant application to build a [[proof of concept]] prototype was submitted in March 1939 to the [[Agronomy]] department which was also interested in speeding up computation for economic and research analysis. $5,000 of further funding ({{Inflation|US|5000|1939|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) to complete the machine came from the nonprofit [[Research Corporation]] of [[New York City]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} \n \n The ABC was built by Atanasoff and Berry in the basement of the physics building at [[Iowa State College]] during 1939\u201342. The initial funds were released in September, and the 11-tube prototype was first demonstrated in October 1939. A December demonstration prompted a grant for construction of the full-scale machine. < ref > {{Citation | last = Mollenhoff | first = Clark R. | year = 1988 | title = Atanasoff: Forgotten Father of the Computer | pages = [https://archive.org/details/atanasoffforgott0000moll/page/47 47, 48] | isbn = 0-8138-0032-3 | publisher = Iowa State University Press | location = Ames | url = https://archive.org/details/atanasoffforgott0000moll/page/47 }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-cdBfPrxfUC|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Iowa|last=Hudson|first=David|last2=Bergman|first2=Marvin|last3=Horton|first3=Loren|date=2009|publisher=University of Iowa Press|isbn=9781587297243|pages=22|language=en}} < /ref >  The ABC was built and tested over the next two years. A January 15, 1941, story in the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' announced the ABC as  \" an electrical computing machine \"  with more than 300 vacuum tubes that would  \" compute complicated algebraic equations \"  (but gave no precise technical description of the computer). The system weighed more than {{convert|700|lb|kg|spell=in}}. It contained approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} of wire, 280 dual-triode [[vacuum tube]]s, 31 [[thyratron]]s, and was about the size of a desk. \n \n It was not a [[Turing complete]] computer, which distinguishes it from more general machines of the same era such as [[Konrad Zuse]]'s 1941 [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] and the [[Colossus computer]]s of 1943\u201345. Nor did it implement the [[stored program architecture]], first implemented in the [[Manchester Baby]] of 1948, required for fully general-purpose practical computing machines. \n \n [[File:Atanasoff-Berry add-subtract module.agr.jpg|thumb|Add-subtract module (reconstructed) from Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer]] \n The machine was, however, the first to implement three critical ideas that are still part of every modern computer: \n #Using [[binary numeral system|binary]] digits to represent all numbers and data \n #Performing all calculations using [[electronics]] rather than wheels, ratchets, or mechanical switches \n #Organizing a system in which [[computation]] and [[computer storage|memory]] are separated. \n \n The memory of the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer was a system called ''regenerative capacitor memory'', which consisted of a pair of drums, each containing 1600 [[capacitor]]s that rotated on a common shaft once per second. The capacitors on each drum were organized into 32  \" bands \"  of 50 (30 active bands and two spares in case a capacitor failed), giving the machine a speed of 30 additions/subtractions per second. Data was represented as 50-bit binary [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] numbers. The electronics of the memory and arithmetic units could store and operate on 60 such numbers at a time (3000 bits). \n \n The [[alternating current]] [[utility frequency|power line frequency]] of 60 & nbsp;Hz was the primary clock rate for the lowest-level operations. \n \n The [[arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic logic functions]] were fully electronic, implemented with vacuum tubes. The family of [[logic gate]]s ranged from inverters to two and three input gates. The input and output levels and operating voltages were compatible between the different gates. Each gate consisted of one inverting vacuum tube amplifier, preceded by a resistor divider input network that defined the logical function. The control logic functions, which only needed to operate once per drum rotation and therefore did not require electronic speed, were electromechanical, implemented with [[relay]]s. \n \n The ALU operated on only one bit of each number at a time; it kept the carry/borrow bit in a capacitor for use in the next AC cycle. < ref > \n John Gustafson. \n [http://johngustafson.net/pubs/pub57/ABCPaper.htm  \" Reconstruction of the Atanasoff-Berry Computer \" ]. \n quote:  \" the total vacuum tube count was very low: about 300 for the entire machine. Much of this economy is the result of operating on only one bit of each number at a time, keeping the carry/borrow bit in a capacitor for use in the next cycle. \" \n < /ref > \n \n Although the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer was an important step up from earlier calculating machines, it was not able to run entirely automatically through an entire problem. An operator was needed to operate the control switches to set up its functions, much like the electro-mechanical calculators and [[unit record equipment]] of the time. Selection of the operation to be performed, reading, writing, converting to or from binary to decimal, or reducing a set of equations was made by front panel switches and in some cases jumpers. \n \n There were two forms of input and output: primary user input and output and an intermediate results output and input. The intermediate results storage allowed operation on problems too large to be handled entirely within the electronic memory. (The largest problem that could be solved without the use of the intermediate output and input was two [[simultaneous equations]], a trivial problem.) \n \n Intermediate results were binary, written onto paper sheets by electrostatically modifying the resistance at 1500 locations to represent 30 of the 50-bit numbers (one equation). Each sheet could be written or read in one second. The reliability of the system was limited to about 1 error in 100,000 calculations by these units, primarily attributed to lack of control of the sheets' material characteristics. In retrospect a solution could have been to add a parity bit to each number as written. This problem was not solved by the time Atanasoff left the university for war-related work. \n \n Primary user input was decimal, via standard [[IBM]] 80-column [[punched card]]s and output was decimal, via a front panel display. \n \n ==Function== \n The ABC was designed for a specific purpose, the solution of systems of simultaneous linear equations. It could handle systems with up to twenty-nine equations, a difficult problem for the time. Problems of this scale were becoming common in physics, the department in which John Atanasoff worked. The machine could be fed two linear equations with up to twenty-nine variables and a constant term and eliminate one of the variables. This process would be repeated manually for each of the equations, which would result in a system of equations with one fewer variable. Then the whole process would be repeated to eliminate another variable. \n \n [[George W. Snedecor]], the head of Iowa State's Statistics Department, was very likely the first user of an electronic digital computer to solve real-world mathematics problems. He submitted many of these problems to Atanasoff. < ref > {{cite book |first=Ra\u00fal |last=Rojas |title=The First Computers: History and Architectures |publisher=MIT Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-262-68137-4 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nDWPW9uwZPAC }} < /ref > \n \n ==Patent dispute== \n On June 26, 1947, J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly were the first to file for patent on a digital computing device ([[ENIAC]]), much to the surprise of Atanasoff. The ABC had been examined by John Mauchly in June 1941, and Isaac Auerbach, < ref > {{cite journal|url=http://purl.umn.edu/104351|title=Oral history interview with Isaac Levin Auerbach|first=Auerbach, Isaac L. (Isaac Levin)|last=1921-1992|date=1 October 1992|website=umn.edu|access-date=6 April 2018}} < /ref >  a former student of Mauchly's, alleged that it influenced his later work on ENIAC, although Mauchly denied this. < ref > {{Citation | last = Shurkin | first = Joel N. | title = Engines of the Mind | publisher = Pocket Books | year = 1985 | edition = Reprint edition (1 Aug. 1985) | pages = [https://archive.org/details/enginesofmindhis00shur/page/280 280\u2013299] | isbn = 978-0671600365 | url = https://archive.org/details/enginesofmindhis00shur/page/280 }} < /ref >  The ENIAC patent did not issue until 1964, and by 1967 [[Honeywell]] sued [[Sperry Rand]] in an attempt to break the ENIAC patents, arguing the ABC constituted [[prior art]]. The [[United States District Court for the District of Minnesota]] released its judgement on October 19, 1973, finding in ''[[Honeywell v. Sperry Rand]]'' that the ENIAC patent was a derivative of John Atanasoff's invention. \n \n Campbell-Kelly and Aspray conclude: \n {{Quote|The extent to which Mauchly drew on Atanasoff's ideas remains unknown, and the evidence is massive and conflicting. The ABC was quite modest technology, and it was not fully implemented. At the very least we can infer that Mauchly saw the potential significance of the ABC and that this may have led him to propose a similar, electronic solution.{{sfn|Campbell-Kelly|Aspray|1996|p=86}}}} \n \n The case was legally resolved on October 19, 1973, when U.S. District Judge Earl R. Larson held the ENIAC patent invalid, ruling that the ENIAC derived many basic ideas from the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer. Judge Larson explicitly stated, \n {{Quote|Eckert and Mauchly did not themselves first invent the automatic electronic digital computer, but instead derived that subject matter from one Dr. John Vincent Atanasoff.}} \n \n [[Herman Goldstine]], one of the original developers of ENIAC wrote: \n \n {{Quote|Atanasoff contemplated storing the coefficients of an equation in capacitors located on the periphery of a cylinder. He apparently had a prototype of his machine working 'early in 1940'. This machine was, it should be emphasized, probably the first use of vacuum tubes to do digital computation and was a special-purpose machine. \n \n This machine never saw the light of day as a serious tool for computation since it was somewhat premature in its engineering conception and limited in its logical one. Nonetheless it must be viewed as a great pioneering effort. Perhaps its chief importance was to influence the thinking of another physicist who was much interested in the computational process, John W. Mauchly. During the period of Atanasoff's work on his linear equation solver, Mauchly was at Ursinus College, a small school in the environs of Philadelphia. Somehow he became aware of Atanasoff's project and visited him for a week in 1941. During the visit the two men apparently went into Atanasoff's ideas in considerable detail. The discussion greatly influenced Mauchly and through him the entire history of electronic computers. < ref > Herman Goldstine, 'The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann', 1972; pp.125-126 < /ref > }} \n \n ==Replica== \n The original ABC was eventually dismantled in 1948, < ref > {{cite book|last1=Soltis|first1=Frank G.|title=Fortress Rochester: The Inside Story of the IBM ISeries|date=2001|publisher=System iNetwork|isbn=9781583040836|page=364|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypJmzqt7JdUC|language=en}} < /ref >  when the university converted the basement to classrooms, and all of its pieces except for one memory drum were discarded. \n \n In 1997, a team of researchers led by [[John Gustafson (scientist)|John Gustafson]] from [[Ames Laboratory]] (located on the Iowa State campus) finished building a working replica of the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer at a cost of $350,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|350000|1997|r=-3|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}).
