His grandson [[Aldus Manutius the Younger]] then ran the firm until his death in 1597.

Protection outside the Republic was more problematic, however.

Manutius met Andrea Torresani, who had acquired publishing equipment from [[Nicolas Jenson|Nicholas Jenson]]'s widow. The Aldine Press was originally owned half by Pier Francesco Barbarigo, the nephew of the current doge of the time, [[Agostino Barbarigo]], and the other half by Andrea Torresani. Manutius owned one fifth of Torresani's share. Manutius mainly was in charge of the scholarship and editing, leaving financial and operating concerns to Barbarigo and Torresani.

At first the press printed new copies of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and other Greek and Latin classics.  \n \n The first edition of Plato's works, known as Aldine edition,  \n was dedicated to [[Pope Leo X]] and included a poem of [[Marcus Musurus]]  and the life of Plato by [[Diogenes Laertius]], which were also included in the first two editions of Plato's works printed in [[Basel]]. < ref name= \" oclc_957714117 \"  / >  The two Basel editions were introduced by a Latin preface written by the Greek scholar [[Simon Grynaeus]] who dedicated the work to the humanist [[Thomas More]]. < ref name= \" oclc_957714117 \" > {{cite book|first1=David|last1=Blair Pass|url=https://www.escholarship.org/contenti/qt0sn280zv.pdf/|title=An Athenian Commentary on Plato's Republic; Poetry, science and textual engagement Prickus' In Rem|format=pdf|page=83|publisher=University of California, Berkeley, Classics Graduate Division|year=2013|access-date=May 18, 2021|oclc=957714117}} (PhD dissertation in Classics) < /ref > \n \n Manutius also printed dictionaries and grammars to help people interpret the books, used by scholars wanting to learn Greek to employ learned Greeks to teach them directly. < ref name= \" The Printing Press as an Agent of Change \" > {{cite book|last1=Eisenstein|first1=Elizabeth L.|title=The Printing Press as an Agent of Change|url=https://archive.org/details/printingpressas01eise|url-access=registration|date=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England}} < /ref >  Historian [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]] claimed that the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453 had threatened the importance and survival of Greek scholarship, but publications such as those by the Aldine Press secured it. [[Erasmus]] was one of the scholars learned in Greek with whom the Aldine Press partnered in order to provide accurately translated text. < ref name= \" The Printing Press as an Agent of Change \"  / > {{rp|221}} The Aldine Press also expanded into current languages, mainly Italian and French. < ref name= \" New Aldine Studies \"  / > [[File:Aldus Manutius LOC photo meetup 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Aldus Manutius LOC photo meetup 2012]] \n ===Humanist typefaces=== \n Aldus Manutius hired [[Francesco Griffo]] to create a typeface designed to reproduce the written hand of the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]]. This resulted in the first {{clarify span|text=roman face|date=July 2020}} adapted and known today as [[italic type]]. It was first used to print [[Pietro Bembo|Cardinal Pietro Bembo's]] ''De Aetna'' in 1495. Before this time print publishing used block letters, the look of handwriting as print was a new phenomenon and, try as he might to prevent it, Manutius' typeface was illegally copied, spreading through Europe. < ref name= \" The Evolution of Type \"  / > \n \n ===Aldus Manutius the Elder's portable books=== \n In 1505 Manutius produced plain texts in useful form, using the term ''[[wikt:enchiridion|enchiridion]]'', meaning a manual or small, hand-held weapon. < ref name= \" New Aldine Studies \"  / >  The [[octavo]] was the first appearance of the editio minor{{cfn|date=July 2020}}, a straightforward text, established as well as the editor can manage. Although these new, portable books were not cheap, the books of the Aldine Press did not force upon their buyers a substantial investment that large volumes of text and commentary demanded during this era. The editio minor, instead, brought financial and logistical benefits to those interested in the classics. An individual didn't have to go to the book, rather now the book came along with them. < ref name= \" New Aldine Studies \"  / > {{rp|1-7}} \n \n ===Imprint and motto=== \n In 1501, Aldus used as his publisher's device the image of a [[dolphin]] wrapped around an [[anchor]]. < ref > H. George Fletcher, ''In praise of Aldus Manutius'' (New York: Morgan Library, 1995), pp. 26\u201327. < /ref >   \" The dolphin and anchor device owed its origins most immediately to Pietro Bembo.

This would become the motto for the Aldine Press. < ref name= \" New Aldine Studies \"  / > \n \n ==The Aldine Press after 1515== \n [[Aldus Manutius]] the Elder died on February 6, 1515. After his death the firm was run by Andrea Torresani and his daughter, Maria, the widow of Aldus Manutius. The Aldine Press was named in 1508 as  \" In the House of Aldus and Andrea Torresano \"  which kept this name until 1529. In 1533, [[Paulus Manutius]] managed the firm, starting it up again and changing its name to  \" Heirs of Aldus and Andrea Torresano \" . In 1539 the imprint changed to  \" Sons of Aldo Manuzio \" . In 1567 [[Aldus Manutius the Younger]] continued the business until his death. < ref name= \" A Bibliographical Sketch of the Aldine Press at Venice \" > {{cite book|last1=Goldsmid|first1=Edmund|title=A Bibliographical Sketch of the Aldine Press at Venice: 3 Volumes|date=1887|publisher=Privately Published|location=Edinburgh}} < /ref > \n \n ==Publications== \n A partial list of publications from the Aldine Press cited from ''Aldus Manutius: A Legacy More Lasting than Bronze''. < ref > {{cite book|last1=George Fletcher|first1=Scott Clemons|title=Aldus Manutius: A Legacy More Lasting than Bronze|date=2015|publisher=The Grolier Glub|location=New York}} < /ref > \n *''Musarum Panagyris'' Aldus Manutius, after March 1487 and before March 1491. \n *''Erotemata cum interpretatione Latina'' Constantine Lascaris, 8 March 1495. \n *''Opusculum de Herone et Leandro, quod et in Latinam Linguam ad verbum tralatum est'' Musaeus, before November 1495 (Greek text) and 1497/98 (Latin text). \n *''Dictionarium Graecum'' Johannes Crastonus, December 1497. \n *''Institutiones Graecae grammatices'' Urban Valeriani, January 1497. \n *''Rudimenta grammatices latinae linguae'' Aldus Manutius, June 1501. \n *''Poetae Christiani veteres'', June 1502. \n *''Institutionum grammaticarum libri quatuor'' Aldus Manutius, December 1514. \n *''Suda'', February 1514. \n \n Works published from the Greeks.
