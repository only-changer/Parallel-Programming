The climate is highland continental: hot summers and cold winters. The land rises to 4,090 m above sea-level at [[Mount Aragats]]. \n \n ==Physical environment== \n [[Image:Armenia 2002 CIA map.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Detailed map of Armenia]]  \n Armenia is located in

the [[Araks River]] and the region around [[Lake Van]] in Turkey. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  Armenia is bordered on the north by Georgia, on the east by Azerbaijan, on the southeast by [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]], on the south by Iran, and on the west by Turkey. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / > \n \n ==Topography and drainage== \n [[Image:Armenia Topography.png|thumb|left|Topography of Armenia]]{{See also|Rivers and lakes of Armenia}}{{See also|Mountains of Armenia}} \n \n Twenty-five million years ago, a geological upheaval pushed up the Earth's crust to form the Armenian Plateau, creating the complex topography of modern Armenia. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  The Lesser Caucasus range extends through northern Armenia, runs southeast between [[Lake Sevan]] and Azerbaijan, then passes roughly along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border to Iran. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  Thus situated, the mountains make travel from north to south difficult. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  Geological turmoil continues in the form of devastating earthquakes, which have plagued Armenia. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  In December 1988, the second largest city in the republic, Leninakan (now [[Gyumri]]), was heavily damaged by a massive quake that killed more than 25,000 people. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / > \n \n About half of Armenia's area of approximately {{convert|29,743|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} has an elevation of at least {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and only 3% of the country lies below {{convert|650|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  The lowest points are in the valleys of the [[Aras (river)|Araks River]] and the [[Debed|Debed River]] in the far north, which have elevations of {{convert|380|and|430|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, respectively. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  Elevations in the Lesser Caucasus vary between {{convert|2640|and|3280|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  To the southwest of the range is the Armenian Plateau, which slopes southwestward toward the Araks River on the Turkish border. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  The plateau is masked by intermediate mountain ranges and extinct volcanoes. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  The largest of these, [[Mount Aragats]], {{convert|4090|m|ft|0|sp=us|abbr=}} high, is also the highest point in [[Armenia]]. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  Most of the population lives in the western and northwestern parts of the country, where the two major cities, [[Yerevan]] and [[Gyumri]], are located. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / > \n \n The valleys of the Debed and [[Aghstafa (river)|Akstafa]] rivers form the chief routes into Armenia from the north as they pass through the mountains. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  [[Lake Sevan]], {{convert|72.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} across at its widest point and {{convert|376|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} long, is by far the largest lake. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  It lies {{convert|1900|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level on the plateau and is

to the extreme southwest. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  Most of Armenia is drained by the [[Araks]] or its tributary, the [[Hrazdan]], which flows from Lake Sevan. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  The Araks forms most of Armenia's border with Turkey and Iran, < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  while the [[Zangezur Mountains]] form the border between Armenia's southern [[Syunik Province|province of Syunik]] and

generally depend upon elevation. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  Mountain formations block the moderating climatic influences of the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, creating wide seasonal variations with cold snowy winters, and warm to hot summers. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  On the Armenian Plateau, the mean midwinter temperature is {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to

from {{convert|250|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year in the lower Araks River valley to {{convert|800|mm|in|1|sp=us}} at the highest altitudes. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  Despite the harshness of winter in most parts (with frosts reaching {{convert|-40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and lower in [[Shirak Province|Shirak]] region{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}), the fertility of the plateau's volcanic soil made Armenia one of the world's earliest sites of agricultural activity. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / > \n \n ==Area and boundaries== \n {{More citations needed|section|date=October 2020}} \n '''Area''': < br
