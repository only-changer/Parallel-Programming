Lincoln led the nation through the [[American Civil War]], the country's greatest moral, cultural, constitutional, and political crisis. He succeeded in preserving the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolishing]] [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], bolstering the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], and modernizing the [[Economy of the United States|U.S. economy]]. \n \n Lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin and was raised on the [[American frontier|frontier]] primarily in [[Indiana]]. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849, he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[history of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President [[1860 United States presidential election|in 1860]], sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the [[Southern United States|South]] equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] [[Battle of Fort Sumter|fired on Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. \n \n As the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents on both sides. [[War Democrat]]s rallied a large faction of former opponents into his moderate camp, but they were countered by [[Radical Republicans]], who demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates. Anti-war Democrats (called  \" [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]] \" ) despised him, and irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements plotted his assassination. Lincoln managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. His [[Gettysburg Address]] became a historic clarion call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and his order that the Army protect and recruit former slaves. He also encouraged [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which outlawed slavery across the country. \n \n Lincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], Lincoln was attending a play at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|he was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln is remembered as a [[martyr]] and hero of the United States and is consistently [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States#Scholar survey results|ranked]] as one of the greatest presidents in American history. \n {{TOC_limit|3}} \n \n ==Family and childhood== \n ===Early life=== \n {{Main|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln}} \n Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, the second child of [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Lincoln|Nancy Hanks Lincoln]], in a log cabin on [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park|Sinking Spring Farm]] near [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=20\u201322}} He was a descendant of [[Samuel Lincoln]], an Englishman who migrated from [[Hingham, Norfolk]], to its namesake, [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], in 1638.

It included two short stints in Kentucky, where he learned to read but probably not to write, at age seven,{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=23}} and in Indiana, where he went to school sporadically due to farm chores, for a total of less than 12 months in aggregate by the age of 15.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p= 29}}  He persisted as an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning.{{sfn|Madison|2014|p=110}} Family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that his reading included the [[King James Version|King James Bible]], [[Aesop's Fables]], [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', and ''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin]]''.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=29\u201331, 38\u201343}} \n \n As a teen, Lincoln took responsibility for chores, and customarily gave his father all earnings from work outside the home until he was 21.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=30\u201333}} Lincoln was tall, strong, and athletic, and became adept at using an ax.{{sfn|Warren|2017|p=134\u2013135}} He was an active wrestler during his youth and trained in the rough [[Catch wrestling|catch-as-catch-can]] style (also known as catch wrestling).

He answered that in the practice of law he frequently came across the word  \" demonstrate \"  but had insufficient understanding of the term.

These were the most famous political debates in American history; they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=214\u2013218}} The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that Douglas\u2019  \" Slave Power \"  was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the Founding Fathers' premise that [[all men are created equal]]. Douglas emphasized his [[Freeport Doctrine]], that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=214\u2013224}} Lincoln's argument assumed a moral tone, as he claimed Douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery.

Lincoln's articulation of the issues gave him a national political presence.{{sfn|Carwardine|2003|pp=89\u201390}} In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the ''Illinois Staats-Anzeiger'', a German-language newspaper that was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but the German-language paper mobilized Republican support.{{sfn|Donald|1996|pp=242, 412}} In the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate, rivaled by [[William H.

While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast, and was unsure whether to seek the office.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=291\u2013293}} In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed his candidacy.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=307\u2013308}} \n \n Traveling untiringly Lincoln made about fifty speeches. By their quality and simplicity he quickly became the champion of the Republican party. However, unlike his overwhelming support in the mid-west his support in the east was not as great, where he sometimes encountered a lack of appreciation and in some quarters was met with much indifference. Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, at that time wrote up an unflattering account of Lincoln's compromising position on slavery and his reluctance to challenge the court's Dred-Scott ruling, which was promptly used against him by his political rivals.{{sfn|Donald|1996|p=200}}{{sfn|Morse|1893|p=112}} \n \n On February 27, 1860, powerful New York Republicans invited Lincoln to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at Cooper Union]], in which he argued that the [[List of national founders|Founding Fathers]] had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery.

On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops [[Battle of Fort Sumter|at Fort Sumter]] and began the fight. Historian [[Allan Nevins]] argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and overlooking Southern Unionist opposition to an invasion.{{sfn|Nevins|1959|p=5:29}} \n \n [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was  \" sadly disappointed \"  at his failure to realize that  \" the country was sleeping on a volcano \"  and that the South was preparing for war.{{sfn|Sherman|1990|pp=185\u2013186}} Donald concludes that,  \" His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft.

This call forced states to choose sides. Virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] as the Confederate capital, despite its exposure to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas followed over the following two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky remained neutral.{{sfn|Oates|1974|p=226}} The Fort Sumter attack rallied Americans north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to defend the nation. \n \n As States sent Union regiments south, on April 19, Baltimore mobs in control of the rail links [[Baltimore riot of 1861|attacked Union troops]] who were changing trains. Local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the Army responded by arresting [[Maryland in the American Civil War#Imposition of martial law|local Maryland]] officials.

He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended ''habeas corpus'', and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers.

He tracked all phases of the effort, consulting with governors, and selecting generals based on their success, their state, and their party. In January 1862, after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced [[United States Secretary of War|War Secretary]] Simon Cameron with [[Edwin Stanton]].
