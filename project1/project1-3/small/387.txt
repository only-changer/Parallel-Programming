The [[Byzantine Emperors|Emperor]] [[Romanos IV]] Diogenes, assuming command in person, met the invaders in [[Cilicia]]. In three arduous campaigns, the Turks were defeated in detail and driven across the Euphrates in 1070. The first two campaigns were conducted by the emperor himself, while the third was directed by Manuel Comnenos, great-uncle of Emperor [[Manuel Comnenus|Manuel Comnenos]]. During this time, Arslan gained the allegiance of [[Rashid al-Dawla Mahmud]], the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo. \n \n In 1071 Romanos again took the field and advanced into Armenia with possibly 30,000 men, including a contingent of [[Cuman]] Turks as well as contingents of [[Franks]] and [[Normans]], under [[Roussel de Bailleul|Ursel de Baieul]]. Alp Arslan, who had moved his troops south to fight the Fatimids, quickly reversed to meet the Byzantines. At [[Manzikert]], on the [[Murat River]], north of [[Lake Van]], the two forces waged the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. The [[Cuman]] mercenaries among the Byzantine forces immediately defected to the Turkic side.

While the Byzantine Empire was to continue for nearly four more centuries, and the Crusades would contest the issue for some time, the victory at Manzikert signalled the beginning of Turkmen < ref name= \" anatolia \" / >  ascendancy in Anatolia. The battle of, especially the victory at Manzikert became so popular among the Turks that later every noble family in Anatolia claimed to have had an ancestor who had fought on that day. < ref name= \" anatolia2 \" > {{cite web |last1=Cahen |first1=Claude |title=Alp-Arslan |url=https://www.britannica.com:443/biography/Alp-Arslan |website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}  \" Later, every princely family in Asia Minor was to claim an ancestor who had fought on that prestigious day. \" < /ref > \n \n Most historians, including [[Edward Gibbon]], date the defeat at Manzikert as the beginning of the end of the Eastern Roman Empire. \n \n == State organization == \n \n Alp Arslan's strength lay in the military realm. Domestic affairs were handled by his able vizier, [[Nizam al-Mulk]], the founder of the administrative organization that characterized and strengthened the sultanate during the reigns of Alp Arslan and his son, Malik Shah. Military [[fiefdom|fiefs]], governed by Seljuq princes, were established to provide support for the soldiery and to accommodate the nomadic Turks to the established Anatolian agricultural scene. This type of military fiefdom enabled the nomadic Turks to draw on the resources of the sedentary Persians, Turks, and other established cultures within the Seljuq realm, and allowed Alp Arslan to field a huge standing army without depending on tribute from conquest to pay his soldiers. He not only had enough food from his subjects to maintain his military, but the taxes collected from traders and merchants added to his coffers sufficiently to fund his continuous wars. \n \n According to the poet [[Saadi Shirazi]]: < ref > {{cite book|title=Wisdom of the East: The Bust\u0430\u0304n of Sadi |translator-last=Edwards |translator-first=A. Hart |date=1911 |publisher=E. P.

Secure from all were those within its walls, for its roads were a labyrinth, like the curls of a bride. \n \n From a learned traveler Qazal once inquired:  \" Didst thou ever, in thy wanderings, see a fort as strong as this? \" \n \n \" Splendid it is, \"  was the reply,  \" but methinks not it confers much strength. Before thee, did not other kings possess it for a while, then pass away? After thee, will not other kings assume control, and eat the fruits of the tree of thy hope? \" \n \n In the estimation of the wise, the world is a false gem that passes each moment from one hand to another. \n }} \n \n [[Suleyman I of R\u00fbm|Suleiman ibn Kutalmish]] was the son of the contender for Arslan's throne; he was appointed governor of the north-western provinces and assigned to completing the invasion of Anatolia. An explanation for this choice can only be conjectured from [[Ibn al-Athir]]'s account of the battle between Alp-Arslan and [[Kutalmish]], in which he writes that Alp-Arslan wept for the latter's death and greatly mourned the loss of his kinsman. \n \n == Death == \n After Manzikert, the dominion of Alp Arslan extended over much of western [[Asia]]. He soon prepared to march for the conquest of [[Turkestan]], the original seat of his ancestors. With a powerful army he advanced to the banks of the [[Oxus river|Oxus]]. Before he could pass the river with safety, however, it was necessary to subdue certain fortresses, one of which was for several days vigorously defended by the Khwarazmian governor, [[Yussuf al-Kharezmi]]. He was obliged to surrender, however, and was carried as a prisoner before the sultan, who condemned him to death. Yussuf drew his dagger and rushed upon the sultan. Alp Arslan, who took great pride in his reputation as an archer, motioned to his guards not to interfere. He drew his bow, but his foot slipped, the arrow glanced aside, and he received the assassin's dagger in his chest. Alp Arslan died from this wound four days later, on 25 November 1072, in his 42nd year. Subsequently, he was taken to [[Merv]] to be buried next to his father, [[Chaghri Beg]]. \n \n == Legacy == \n Alp Arslan is widely regarded as having begun [[Anatolianism]], although unintentionally. His victory at Manzikert is often cited as the beginning of the end of Byzantine power in Anatolia, and the beginning of Turkic identity there. \n \n Alp Arslan's conquest of Anatolia from the Byzantines is also seen as one of the pivotal precursors to the launch of the [[crusade]]s. \n \n From 2002 to July 2008 under [[Renaming of Turkmen months and days of week, 2002|Turkmen calendar reform]], the month of August was named after Alp Arslan. \n \n The [[2nd Training Motorized Rifle Division]] of the [[Turkmen Ground Forces]] is named in his honour. \n \n == References == \n {{reflist}} \n \n == Sources == \n * {{cite book | title = The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 5: The Saljuq and Mongol periods | year = 1968 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | editor-last = Frye | editor-first = R.
