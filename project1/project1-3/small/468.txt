Engagements took place in [[North America]], the [[Caribbean Sea]], and in the [[North Atlantic]], specifically the [[North Sea]], the [[Irish Sea]], and the [[English Channel]]. Formally, the  \" American War \"  was from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] by Congress addressed to Great Britain, to the September 1783 British-American [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] to end the American Revolutionary War. Though signed on 2 September, it did not take effect until the day after  \" at the pleasure \"  of King George, at the signing of the Anglo-French [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] in the palace of Louis XVI; the Anglo-Spanish [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] followed the French. The Congress was not a signatory to either of these last two. < ref > [[#wallaceray2015|Wallace 2015]],  \" American Revolution \" < /ref > }} From their founding in the 1600s, the colonies were largely left to govern themselves. The cost of victory in the 1754 to 1763 [[French and Indian War]] and the 1756 to 1763 [[Seven Years' War]] left the British government deeply in debt; the [[The Thirteen Colonies|colonies]], where the war was fought, equipped and populated the British forces there at the cost of millions of their own funds. The [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] and [[Townshend Acts]] provoked colonial opposition and unrest, leading to the 1770 [[Boston Massacre]] and 1773 [[Boston Tea Party]]. When Parliament imposed the [[Intolerable Acts]] in spring 1774 upon [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], twelve colonies sent delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]] (September 5 \u2013 October 26, 1774) to draft a [[Petition to the King]] and organize a boycott of British goods.{{Efn|The [[colony of Georgia]] joined the Continental Congress later. Of interest, the [[Vermont Republic]] was independently established 1777\u20131791 before its admission to the US. Their [[Green Mountain Boys]] won an early engagement in May 1775 at [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|Ticonderoga]], and [[Ethan Allen]] later served as a general in the Continental Army.}} \n \n Fighting broke out on 19 April 1775: the British army stationed at Boston was harassed by the Massachusetts militia at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] after destroying colonial Assembly powder stores. In June, the [[Second Continental Congress]] appointed [[George Washington]] to create a [[Continental Army]] and oversee the [[Siege of Boston|capture of Boston]] (April 19, 1775 \u2013 March 17, 1776). The [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] sent the [[Olive Branch Petition]] (signed July 8, 1775) to the King and Parliament, both of whom rejected it. In response, they invaded [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|British Quebec]] but were repulsed. In July 1776, Congress unanimously passed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Hopes of a quick settlement were supported by [[Rockingham Whigs|American sympathizers within Parliament]] who opposed [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]]'s  \" coercion policy \"  in the colonies. However, after the British were [[Siege of Boston|driven out]] of Boston the new British commander-in-chief, General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]], launched a [[New York and New Jersey campaign|counter-offensive]] and captured New York City. After [[George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|crossing the Delaware]] Washington engaged and routed Hessian forces at the [[Battle of Trenton]] and the British at the [[Battle of Princeton]]. After British General [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] surrendered at the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October 1777, Howe's 1777\u20131778 [[Philadelphia campaign]] captured that city. Washington retreated to [[Valley Forge]] during the winter of 1777\u20131778 where Prussian allied General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|von Steuben]] drilled the largely untrained [[Continental Army]] into an organized fighting unit. \n \n French Foreign Minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Vergennes]] saw the war as a way to create an America economically and militarily dependent on France, not Britain. Although talks on a formal alliance began in late 1776, they proceeded slowly until the Patriot victory at Saratoga in October 1777. Fears Congress might come to an early settlement with Britain resulted in France and the United States signing two treaties in February 1778. The first was a [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (France\u2013United States)|commercial treaty]], the second a [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|Treaty of Alliance]]; in return for a French guarantee of American independence, Congress agreed to join the war against Britain and defend the [[French West Indies]]. Although Spain refused to join the Franco-American alliance, in the 1779 [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)|Treaty of Aranjuez]] they agreed to support France in its [[Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)|global war with Britain]], hoping to regain losses incurred in 1713. \n \n In other fronts in North America, Governor of Spanish Louisiana [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez, 1st Viscount of Galveston|Bernardo G\u00e1lvez]] routed British forces from [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]]. The Spanish, along with [[Privateer#United States|American privateers]] supplied the 1779 American conquest of [[Illinois campaign|Western Quebec]] ([[Northwest Territory#British control|later the US Northwest Territory]]). < ref > [[#nessy|O'Shaughnessy 2013]], p. 179. < /ref >  G\u00e1lvez then expelled British forces from Mobile during the [[Battle of Fort Charlotte]] and the [[siege of Pensacola]], cutting off British military aid to their American Indian allies in the interior southeast. Howe's replacement, General [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Sir Henry Clinton]], then mounted a 1778  \" [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War#British campaign in the South|Southern strategy]] \"  from Charleston. After [[Capture of Savannah|capturing Savannah]], defeats at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] and the [[Battle of Cowpens]] forced [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Cornwallis]] to retreat to [[Siege of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]], where his army was besieged by an allied French and American force. An attempt to resupply the garrison was repulsed by the French navy at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], and Cornwallis surrendered in October 1781. \n \n Although their war with France and Spain continued for another two years, the British fight against the Americans ended with the Battle of Yorktown. The [[North Ministry]] was replaced by [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]], who accepted office on the basis [[George III]] agreed to American independence. Preliminary articles were signed in November 1782, and in April 1783 Congress accepted British terms; these included independence, evacuation of British troops, cession of territory up to the [[Mississippi River]] and navigation to the sea, as well as fishing rights in Newfoundland.

This event would be known as the [[Boston Tea Party]]. In response, Parliament passed the Coercive Acts, also called the [[Intolerable Acts]] by the colonists.

To restore the empire, the British had to defeat the Continental Army in the early months, and compel the Congress to dissolve itself. < ref > [[#mays2019|Mays 2019]], pp. 1\u20132 < /ref >  Historian Terry M. Mays identifies three separate types of warfare, the first being a colonial conflict in which objections to Imperial trade regulation were as significant as taxation policy. The second was a civil war with all thirteen states split between Patriots, Loyalists and those who preferred to remain neutral. Particularly in the south, many battles were fought between Patriots and Loyalists with no British involvement, leading to divisions that continued after independence was achieved. < ref > [[#mays2019|Mays 2019]], pp. 2-3 < /ref > \n \n The third element was a global war between France, Spain, the Dutch Republic and Britain, with America as one of a number of different theaters. < ref > [[#mays2019|Mays 2019]], pp. 2-3 < /ref >  After entering the war in 1778, France provided the Americans money, weapons, soldiers, and naval assistance, while French troops fought under US command in North America. While Spain did not formally join the war in America, they provided access to the Mississippi River and by capturing British possessions on the Gulf of Mexico denied bases to the Royal Navy, as well as retaking [[Menorca]] and besieging [[Gibraltar]] in Europe. < ref > [[#davenport1917|Davenport 1917]], p. 168 < /ref > \n \n Although the Dutch Republic was no longer a major power, prior to 1774 they still dominated the European carrying trade, and Dutch merchants made large profits by shipping French-supplied munitions to the Patriots. This ended when Britain [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War|declared war]] in December 1780 and the conflict proved disastrous to their economy. < ref > [[#Scott|Scott 1988]], pp. 572\u2013573 < /ref >  The Dutch were also excluded from the [[First League of Armed Neutrality]], formed by Russia, Sweden and Denmark in March 1780 to protect neutral shipping from being stopped and searched for contraband by Britain and France. < ref > [[#grainger2005|Grainger 2005]], p. 10 < /ref >  While of limited effect, these interventions forced the British to divert men and resources away from North America. < ref > [[#mays2019|Mays 2019]], p. 3 < /ref > \n \n === American strategy === \n [[File:Population Density in the American Colonies 1775.gif|thumb|left|alt=MAP of North America east of the Mississippi River outlining state borders in 1782 after state cessions of the Northwest Territory to Congress.

Their prosperous state populations depended on local production for food and supplies rather than on imports from their mother country that lay six to twelve weeks away by sail. They were spread across most of the North American Atlantic seaboard, stretching 1,000 miles. Most farms were remote from the seaports, and controlling four or five major ports did not give British armies control over the inland areas. Each state had established internal distribution systems. < ref > [[#jgreene2008|Greene  &  Pole 2008]], pp. 36\u201339 < /ref > \n \n Each former colony had a long-established system of local militia, combat-tested in support of British regulars thirteen years before to secure an expanded British Empire. Together they took away French claims in North America west to the Mississippi River in the [[French and Indian War]]. The state legislatures independently funded and controlled their local militias. In the American Revolution, they trained and provided Continental Line regiments to the regular army, each with their own state officer corps. < ref > [[#jgreene2008|Greene  &  Pole 2008]], pp. 36\u201339 < /ref >  Motivation was also a major asset: each colonial capital had its own newspapers and printers, and the Patriots had more popular support than the Loyalists.

Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time and lacked the training and discipline of more experienced soldiers. Local county militias were reluctant to travel far from home and they were unavailable for extended operations. < ref > [[#black2001|Black 2001]] & nbsp;[1991], p. 59 < /ref >  To compensate for this, Congress established a regular force known as the Continental Army on June 14, 1775, the origin of the modern [[United States Army]], and appointed Washington as commander-in-chief. However, it suffered significantly from the lack of an effective training program and from largely inexperienced officers and sergeants, offset by a few senior officers. < ref > [[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 286\u2013287 < /ref > \n \n Each state legislature appointed officers for both county and state militias and their regimental Continental Line officers; although Washington was required to accept Congressional appointments, he was still permitted to choose and command his own generals, such as [[Nathanael Greene]], his chief of artillery, [[Henry Knox]], and [[Alexander Hamilton]], the chief of staff. < ref > [[#higginbotham1987|Higginbotham 1987]], Chap.3 < /ref >  One of Washington's most successful recruits to general officer was Baron [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff who wrote the [[Revolutionary War Drill Manual]]. < ref > [[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 286\u2013287 < /ref >  The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war; when properly employed, the combination allowed them to overwhelm smaller British forces, as at Concord, Boston, Bennington, and Saratoga.

The great successes at [[Siege of Boston|Boston]] (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777), and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781) were won from trapping the British far from base with a greater number of troops. < ref > [[#higginbotham1987|Higginbotham 1987]], Chap.3 < /ref >  Nevertheless, after 1778, Washington's army was transformed into a more disciplined and effective force, mostly by [[Baron von Steuben]]'s training. < ref > [[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 286\u2013287 < /ref >  Immediately after the Army emerged from Valley Forge, it proved its ability to match the British troops in action at the [[Battle of Monmouth]], including a black Rhode Island regiment fending off a British bayonet attack then counter-charging for the first time in Washington's army. < ref > [[#ferling2007|Ferling 2007]], pp. 294\u2013295 < /ref >  Here Washington came to realize that saving entire towns was not necessary, but preserving his army and keeping the revolutionary spirit alive was more important in the long run.
