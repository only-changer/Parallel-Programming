The Apollo{{nbs}}7 crew [[commander (Apollo program)|was commanded]] by [[Wally Schirra|Walter M. Schirra]], with [[command module pilot]] [[Donn F. Eisele]] and [[lunar module pilot]] [[R. Walter Cunningham]] (so designated even though Apollo{{nbs}}7 did not carry a [[lunar module]]). \n \n The three astronauts were originally designated for the second crewed Apollo flight, and then as backups for Apollo{{nbs}}1. After the fire, crewed flights were suspended while the cause of the accident was investigated and improvements made to the spacecraft and safety procedures, and uncrewed test flights made. Determined to prevent a repetition of the fire, the crew spent long periods of time monitoring the construction of their [[Apollo command and service module]]s (CSM). Training continued over much of the 21-month pause that followed the Apollo{{nbs}}1 disaster. \n \n Apollo 7 was launched on October 11, 1968, from [[Cape Kennedy Air Force Station]], Florida, and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean eleven days later. Extensive testing of the CSM took place, and also the first live television broadcast from an American spacecraft. Despite tension between the crew and ground controllers, the mission was a complete technical success, giving NASA the confidence to send [[Apollo & nbsp;8]] into orbit around the [[Moon]] two months later. In part because of these tensions, none of the crew flew in space again, though Schirra had already announced he would retire from NASA after the flight. Apollo{{nbs}}7 fulfilled Apollo{{nbs}}1's mission of testing the CSM in [[low Earth orbit]], and was a significant step towards NASA's goal of landing astronauts on the Moon. \n \n ==Background and personnel== \n \n {{Spaceflight crew \n |terminology      = Astronaut < ref name= \" crew \" > {{cite web |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/topics/apollo/apollo-program/orbital-missions/apollo7-crew.cfm |title=Apollo 7 Crew |publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]] |access-date=April 19, 2018}} < /ref > \n |position1        = Commander \n |crew1_up         = [[Wally Schirra|Walter M.

He flew [[Mercury-Atlas 8]] in 1962, the fifth crewed flight of [[Project Mercury]] (the third to reach orbit) and was the command pilot for [[Gemini 6A]]. He was a 45-year-old captain in the Navy at the time of Apollo{{nbs}}7. Eisele graduated from the Naval Academy in 1952 with a B.S. in aeronautics. He elected to be commissioned in the Air Force, and was a 38-year-old major at the time of Apollo{{nbs}}7.{{sfn|Orloff  &  Harland 2006|p=171}} Cunningham joined the U.S. Navy in 1951, began flight training the following year, and served in a Marine flight squadron from 1953 to 1956, and was a civilian, aged 36, serving in the Marine Corps reserves with a rank of major, at the time of Apollo{{nbs}}7.{{sfn|Orloff  &  Harland 2006|p=171}}{{sfn|Press Kit|p=68}} He received degrees in physics from [[UCLA]], a B.A. in 1960 and an M.A. in 1961. Both Eisele and Cunningham were selected as part of the [[NASA Astronaut Group 3|third group of astronauts]] in 1963.{{sfn|Orloff  &  Harland 2006|p=171}} \n [[File:AS-205 crew.jpg|thumb|right|Schirra's crew trains for Apollo{{nbs}}2, 1966]] \n \n Eisele was originally slotted for a position on [[Gus Grissom]]'s [[Apollo & nbsp;1]] crew along with [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], but days prior to the official announcement on March 25, 1966, Eisele sustained a shoulder injury that would require surgery. Instead, [[Roger Chaffee]] was given the position and Eisele was reassigned to Schirra's crew.{{sfn|French  &  Burgess 2007|pp=689\u2013691}} \n \n Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham were first named as an Apollo crew on September 29, 1966. They were to fly a second Earth orbital test of the [[Apollo command and service module#Command module|Apollo Command Module]] (CM).{{sfn|French  &  Burgess 2007|pp=955\u2013957}} Although delighted as a rookie to be assigned to a prime crew without having served as a backup, Cunningham was troubled by the fact that Apollo{{nbs}}2 seemed unnecessary if Apollo{{nbs}}1 was successful. He learned later that Director of Flight Crew Operations [[Deke Slayton]], another of the Mercury Seven who had been grounded for medical reasons and supervised the astronauts, planned, with Schirra's support, to command the mission if he gained medical clearance. When this was not forthcoming, Schirra remained in command of the crew, and in November 1966, Apollo{{nbs}}2 was cancelled and Schirra's crew assigned as backup to Grissom's.{{sfn|Cunningham 2003|pp=88\u201391}} Apollo 2 backup commander [[Thomas P. Stafford]] stated that the cancellation followed Schirra and his crew submitting a list of demands to NASA management (Schirra wanted the mission to include a lunar module and a CM capable of docking with it), and that the assignment as backups left Schirra complaining that Slayton and [[Chief Astronaut]] [[Alan Shepard]] had destroyed his career.{{sfn|Stafford 2002|pp=552\u2013556}} \n \n On January 27, 1967, Grissom's crew was conducting a launch-pad test for their planned February 21 mission, when a fire broke out in the cabin, killing all three men.{{sfn|Chaikin 1998|pp=12\u201318}} A complete safety review of the Apollo program followed.{{sfn|Scott  &  Leonov|pp=193\u2013195}} Soon after the fire, Slayton asked Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham to fly the first mission after the pause.{{sfn|Cunningham 2003|p=113}} Apollo 7 would use the Block{{nbs}}II spacecraft designed for the lunar missions, as opposed to the Block I CSM used for Apollo 1, which was intended only to be used for the early Earth-orbit missions, as it lacked the capability of docking with a lunar module. The CM and astronauts' spacesuits had been extensively redesigned, to reduce any chance of a repeat of the accident which killed the first crew. < ref name= \" Schirra's Obituary \" > {{cite news |last=Watkins |first=Thomas |date=May 3, 2007 |title=Astronaut Walter Schirra dies at 84 |url=http://www.valleymorningstar.com/news/latest_news/article_b5ab61b9-cbe9-5db5-b76f-8cfd89096919.html |newspaper=[[Valley Morning Star]] |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131005020013/http://www.valleymorningstar.com/news/latest_news/article_b5ab61b9-cbe9-5db5-b76f-8cfd89096919.html |archive-date=October 5, 2013 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |location=Harlingen, Texas |access-date=October 4, 2013 |url-status=live }} < /ref >  Schirra's crew would test the [[life support]], [[propulsion]], guidance and control systems during this  \" open-ended \"  mission (meaning it would be extended as it passed each test).

Flight directors were [[Glynn Lunney]], [[Gene Kranz]] and [[Gerry Griffin]].{{sfn|Orloff  &  Harland 2006|pp=171\u2013172}} \n \n ==Preparation== \n \n According to Cunningham, Schirra originally had limited interest in making a third spaceflight, beginning to focus on his post-NASA career. Flying the first mission after the fire changed things,  \" Wally Schirra was being pictured as the man chosen to rescue the manned space program. And that was a task worthy of Wally's interest. \" {{sfn|Cunningham 2003|pp=115\u2013116}} Eisele noted,  \" coming on the heels of the fire, we knew the fate and future of the entire manned space program\u2014not to mention our own skins\u2014was riding on the success or failure of Apollo{{nbs}}7. \" {{sfn|Eisele 2017|p=38}} \n \n Given the circumstances of the fire, the crew initially had little confidence in the staff at [[North American Aviation]]'s plant at [[Downey, California]], who built the Apollo command modules, and they were determined to follow their craft every step of the way through construction and testing. This interfered with training, but the simulators of the CM were not yet ready, and they knew it would be a long time until they launched. They spent long periods of time at Downey. Simulators were constructed at Houston's [[Johnson Space Center|Manned Spacecraft Center]] and at KSC in Florida. Once these were available for use, the crew had difficulty finding enough time to do everything, even with the help of the backup and support crews; the crew often worked 12 or 14 hours per day. After the CM was completed and shipped to KSC, the focus of the crew's training shifted to Florida, though they went to Houston for planning and technical meetings. Rather than return to their Houston homes for the weekend, they often had to remain at KSC in order to participate in training or spacecraft testing.{{sfn|Eisele 2017|pp=35\u201339}} According to former astronaut [[Tom Jones (astronaut)|Tom Jones]] in a 2018 article, Schirra,  \" with indisputable evidence of the risks his crew would be taking, now had immense leverage with management at NASA and North American, and he used it. In conference rooms or on the spacecraft assembly line, Schirra got his way. \" < ref name =  \" fight \"  / > \n [[File:Apollo 7 crew during water egress training.jpg|thumb|left|The crew during water egress training]] \n \n The Apollo 7 crew spent five hours in training for every hour they could expect to remain aboard if the mission went its full eleven days. In addition, they attended technical briefings and pilots' meetings, and studied on their own. They undertook launch pad evacuation training, water egress training to exit the vehicle after splashdown, and learned to use firefighting equipment. They trained on the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]] at [[MIT]]. Each crew member spent 160 hours in CM simulations, in some of which Mission Control in Houston participated live.{{sfn|Press Kit|pp=55\u201357}} The  \" plugs out \"  test\u2014the test that had killed the Apollo{{nbs}}1 crew\u2014was conducted with the prime crew in the spacecraft, but with the hatch open.{{sfn|Press Kit|pp=37, 41}} One reason the Apollo{{nbs}}1 crew had died was because it was impossible to open the inward-opening hatch before the fire raced through the cabin; this was changed for Apollo{{nbs}}7.{{sfn|Orloff  &  Harland 2006|pp=110\u2013115}} \n \n Command modules similar to that used on Apollo{{nbs}}7 were subjected to tests in the run-up to the mission. A three-astronaut crew ([[Joseph P. Kerwin]], [[Vance D. Brand]] and [[Joe H. Engle]]) was inside a CM that was placed in a vacuum chamber at the Manned Spaceflight Center in Houston for eight days in June 1968 to test spacecraft systems. Another crew, ([[James Lovell]], [[Stuart Roosa]] and [[Charles M. Duke]]) spent 48 hours at sea aboard a CM lowered into the Gulf of Mexico from a naval vessel in April 1968, to test how systems would respond to seawater. Further tests were conducted the following month in a tank at Houston. Fires were set aboard a [[boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] CM using various atmospheric compositions and pressures. The results led to the decision to use 60 percent oxygen and 40 percent nitrogen within the CM at launch, which would be replaced with a lower pressure of pure oxygen within four hours, as providing adequate fire protection. Other boilerplate spacecraft were subjected to drops to test parachutes, and to simulate the likely damage if a CM came down on land. All results were satisfactory.{{sfn|Press Kit|pp=70\u201375}} \n \n During the run-up to the mission, the Soviets sent uncrewed probes [[Zond & nbsp;4]] and [[Zond & nbsp;5]] around the Moon, seeming to foreshadow a circumlunar crewed mission. NASA's [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) was suffering delays, and Apollo Program Spacecraft Manager [[George Low]] proposed that if Apollo{{nbs}}7 was a success, that [[Apollo & nbsp;8]] go to lunar orbit without a LM. The acceptance of Low's proposal raised the stakes for Apollo{{nbs}}7. < ref name =  \" fight \"  / > {{sfn|Chaikin 1998|p=76}} According to Stafford, Schirra  \" clearly felt the full weight of the program riding on a successful mission and as a result became more openly critical and more sarcastic. \" {{sfn|Stafford 2002|p=616}} \n \n Throughout the Mercury and Gemini programs, [[McDonnell Aircraft]] engineer [[Guenter Wendt]] led the spacecraft launch pad teams, with ultimate responsibility for condition of the spacecraft at launch. He earned the astronauts' respect and admiration, including Schirra's. < ref name= \" Guenter Wendt Obit \" > {{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-050310a.html |title=Guenter Wendt, 86, 'Pad Leader' for NASA's moon missions, dies |last=Pearlman |first=Robert Z. |author-link=Robert Pearlman |date=May 3, 2010 |website=[[collectSPACE]] |publisher=Robert Pearlman |access-date=June 12, 2014}} < /ref >  However, the spacecraft contractor had changed from McDonnell (Mercury and Gemini) to North American (Apollo), so Wendt was not the pad leader for Apollo{{nbs}}1. < ref name= \" FirstOnTheMoon \" > [[#Farmer  &  Hamblin 1970|Farmer  &  Hamblin 1970]], pp. 51\u201354 < /ref >  So adamant was Schirra in his desire to have Wendt back as pad leader for his Apollo flight, that he got his boss Slayton to persuade North American management to hire Wendt away from McDonnell, and Schirra personally lobbied North American's launch operations manager to change Wendt's shift from midnight to day so he could be pad leader for Apollo{{nbs}}7.

First, they maneuvered the craft with the S-IVB still attached, as would be required for [[Trans-lunar injection|the burn]] that would take lunar missions to the Moon. Then, after separation from the S-IVB, Schirra turned the CSM around and approached a docking target painted on the S-IVB, simulating the docking maneuver with the lunar module on Moon-bound missions prior to extracting the combined craft. < ref name = nyt1012 / > \n After [[Orbital station-keeping|station keeping]] with the S-IVB for 20 minutes, Schirra let it drift away, putting {{convert|76|mi}} between the CSM and it in preparation for the following day's rendezvous attempt. < ref name= \" fight \" / > \n [[Image:As7-3-1545.jpg|thumb|left|Apollo 7 S-IVB rocket stage in orbit]] \n \n The astronauts also enjoyed a hot lunch, the first hot meal prepared on an American spacecraft. < ref name = nyt1012 > {{cite news|last=Wilford|first=John Noble|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1968/10/12/76935378.html?pageNumber=1|pages=1, 20|title=3 on Apollo 7 circling Earth in 11-day test for moon trip|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 12, 1968}} < /ref >  Schirra had brought instant coffee along over the opposition of NASA doctors, who argued it added nothing nutritionally.{{sfn|Schirra 1988|pp=192\u2013193}} Five hours after launch, he reported having, and enjoying, his first plastic bag full of coffee. < ref name =  \" coffee \" > {{cite web|work=Apollo 7 Flight Journal|url=https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap07fj/a7_04_day1.html|title=Day 1, part 4: Remainder (preliminary)|date=April 2, 2018|access-date=October 17, 2020}} < /ref > \n \n The purpose of the rendezvous was to demonstrate the CSM's ability to match orbits with and rescue a LM after an aborted lunar landing attempt, or following liftoff from the lunar surface.{{sfn|Press Kit|p=14}} This was to occur on the second day; but by the end of the first, Schirra had reported he had a cold, and, despite Slayton coming on the loop to argue in favor, declined Mission Control's request that the crew power up and test the onboard television camera prior to the rendezvous, citing the cold, that the crew had not eaten, and that there was already a very full schedule. < ref name= \" fight \" / > \n \n The rendezvous was complicated by the fact that the Apollo{{nbs}}7 spacecraft lacked a rendezvous radar, something the Moon-bound missions would have. The SPS, the engine that would be needed to send later Apollo CSMs into and out of lunar orbit, had been fired only on a test stand. Although the astronauts were confident it would work, they were concerned it might fire in an unexpected manner, necessitating an early end to the mission. The burns would be computed from the ground but the final work in maneuvering up to the S-IVB would require Eisele to use the telescope and [[sextant]] to compute the final burns, with Schirra applying the ship's [[reaction control system]] (RCS) thrusters. Eisele was startled by the violent jolt caused by activating the SPS. The thrust caused Schirra to yell,  \" Yabba dabba doo! \"  in reference to ''[[The Flintstones]]'' cartoon.

This would have been impossible wearing the helmets. Over several days, Schirra refused advice from the ground that the helmets should be worn, stating it was his prerogative as commander to decide this, though Slayton warned him he would have to answer for it after the flight. Schirra stated in 1994,  \" In this case I had a cold, and I'd had enough discussion with the ground, and I didn't have much more time to talk about whether we would put the helmet on or off.
