He was the second son of King [[Sancho Ram\u00edrez]] and successor of his brother [[Peter I of Aragon|Peter I]]. With his marriage to [[Urraca of Castile|Urraca]], queen regnant of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], in 1109, he began to use, with some justification, the grandiose title [[Imperator totius Hispaniae|Emperor of Spain]], formerly employed by his father-in-law, [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n|Alfonso VI]]. Alfonso the Battler earned his sobriquet in the [[Reconquista]]. He won his greatest military successes in the middle [[Ebro]], where he conquered [[Zaragoza]] in 1118 and took [[Ejea de los Caballeros|Ejea]], [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]], [[Calatayud]], [[Borja, Zaragoza|Borja]], [[Tarazona]], [[Daroca]], and [[Monreal del Campo]]. He died in September 1134 after an unsuccessful battle with the [[Muslims]] at the [[Battle of Fraga]]. \n \n His nickname comes from the [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] version of the ''[[Chronicle of San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a]]'' (c. 1370), which says that  \" they called him lord Alfonso the battler because in Spain there wasn't as good a knight who won twenty-nine battles \"  (''clamabanlo don Alfonso batallador porque en Espayna no ovo tan buen cavallero que veynte nueve batallas ven\u00e7i\u00f3''). < ref > Carmen Orc\u00e1stegui Gros (ed.), [https://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/10/06/7orcastegui.pdf  \" Cr\u00f3nica de San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a (Versi\u00f3n aragonesa) \" ], ''Cuadernos de Historia Jer\u00f3nimo Zurita'', 51\u201352 (Zaragoza, Instituci\u00f3n \u00abFernando el Cat\u00f3lico\u00bb, 1985), p. 459. < /ref > \n \n ==Early life== \n His earliest years were passed in the [[Abbey of San Pedro de Siresa|monastery of Siresa]], learning to read and write and to practice the military arts under the tutelage of Lope Garc\u00e9s the Pilgrim, who was repaid for his services by his former charge with the county of [[Pedrola]] when Alfonso came to the throne. \n \n During his brother's reign, he participated in the taking of Huesca (the [[Battle of Alcoraz]], 1096), which became the largest city in the kingdom and the new capital.  He also joined [[El Cid]]'s expeditions in [[Valencia (taifa)|Valencia]].  His father gave him the lordships of [[Biel, Zaragoza|Biel]], [[Luna, Zaragoza|Luna]], [[Ardenes]], and [[Bailo, Spain|Bailo]]. \n \n A series of deaths put Alfonso directly in line for the throne.  His brother's children, Isabella and Peter (who married Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez, daughter of [[El Cid]]), died in 1103 and 1104 respectively. \n \n ==Matrimonial conflicts== \n A passionate fighting-man (he fought twenty-nine battles against Christian or Moor), he was married  (when well over 30 years and a habitual bachelor) in 1109 to the ambitious Queen [[Urraca of Le\u00f3n]], a passionate woman unsuited for a subordinate role.  The marriage had been arranged by her father [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n]] in 1106 to unite the two chief Christian states against the [[Almoravides|Almoravids]], and to supply them with a capable military leader.  But Urraca was tenacious of her right as [[queen regnant]] and had not learnt chastity in the polygamous household of her father. Husband and wife quarrelled with the brutality of the age and came to open war, even placing Urraca under siege at Astorga in 1112.{{sfn|Reilly|1995|p=133-134}} Alfonso had the support of one section of the nobles who found their account in the confusion. Being a much better soldier than any of his opponents he won the [[Battle of Candespina]] and the [[Battle of Viadangos]], but his only trustworthy supporters were his Aragonese, who were not numerous enough to keep [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] subjugated. The marriage of Alfonso and Urraca was declared null by the pope, as they were second cousins, in 1110, but he ignored the papal nuncio and clung to his liaison with Urraca until 1114. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" > {{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso I., king of Aragon|volume=1|pages=734-735}} < /ref >  During his marriage, he had called himself  \" King and Emperor of Castile, Toledo, Arag\u00f3n, Pamplona, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza \"  in recognition of his rights as Urraca's husband; of his inheritance of the lands of his father, including the kingdom of his great-uncle [[Gonzalo of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza|Gonzalo]]; and his prerogative to conquer [[Andalusia]] from the Muslims.  He inserted the title of ''imperator'' on the basis that he had three kingdoms under his rule. \n \n Alfonso's late marriage and his failure to remarry and produce the essential legitimate heir that should have been a dynastic linchpin of his aggressive territorial policies have been adduced as a lack of interest in women. Ibn al-Athir (1166\u20131234) describes Alfonso as a tireless soldier who would sleep in his armor without benefit of cover, whom when asked why he did not take his pleasure from one of the captives of Muslim chiefs, responded that the man devoted to war needs the companionship of men not women.{{efn|No bastards are recorded, though they would have cut prominent figures under the circumstances.

He was finally compelled to give way in Castile and Le\u00f3n to his stepson, [[Alfonso VII of Castile]], son of Urraca and her first husband.  The intervention of [[Pope Calixtus II]] brought about an arrangement between the old man and his young namesake. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / > \n \n In 1122 in Belchite, he founded [[Confraternity of Belchite|a confraternity of knights]] to fight against the Almoravids.{{sfn|Constable|Zurro|2012|p=203}}  It was the start of the military orders in Aragon.  Years later, he organised a branch of the ''Militia Christi'' of the [[Holy Land]] at [[Monreal del Campo]]. \n \n ==Military expansion== \n Alfonso spent his first four years as king in near-constant war with the Muslims.  In 1105, he conquered Ejea and Tauste and refortified Castellar and Juslibol.  In 1106, he defeated [[Ahmad II al-Musta'in]] of Zaragoza at Valtierra.  In 1107, he took Tamarite de Litera and Esteban de la Litera.  Then followed a period dominated by his relations with Castile and Le\u00f3n through his wife, Urraca.  He resumed his conquest in 1117 by conquering [[Fitero]], [[Corella, Spain|Corella]], [[Cintru\u00e9nigo]], [[Murchante]], [[Monteagudo, Navarre|Monteagudo]], and [[Cascante]]. \n \n In 1118, the Council of Toulouse declared a [[crusade]] to assist in the conquest of [[Zaragoza]].  Many Frenchmen consequently joined Alfonso at [[Ayerbe]].  They took Almud\u00e9var, Gurrea de G\u00e1llego, and Zuera, besieging Zaragoza itself by the end of May. The city fell on 18 December, and the forces of Alfonso occupied the Azuda, the government tower.  The great palace of the city was given to the monks of Bernard.  Promptly, the city was made Alfonso's capital.  Two years later, in 1120, he defeated a Muslim army intent on reconquering his new capital at the [[Battle of Cutanda]]. He promulgated the ''fuero'' of ''tortum per tortum'', facilitating taking the law into one's own hands, which among others reassumed the Muslim right to dwell in the city and their right to keep their properties and practice their religion under their own jurisdiction as long as they maintained tax payment and relocated to the suburbs. \n \n [[File:Estatua de Alfonso I de Arag\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|upright|Modern statue of Alfonso as a warrior in the Parque Grande Jos\u00e9 Antonio Labordeta, Zaragoza]] \n \n In 1119, he retook Cervera, Tudejen, Castell\u00f3n, Tarazona, \u00c1greda, Magall\u00f3n, Borja, Alag\u00f3n, Novillas, Mall\u00e9n, Rueda, \u00c9pila and populated the region of [[Soria]].  He began the siege of [[Calatayud]], but left to defeat the army at Cutanda trying to retake Zaragoza.  When Calatayud fell, he took Bubierca, Alhama de Arag\u00f3n, Ariza, and Daroca (1120).  In 1123, he besieged and took [[Lleida]], which was in the hands of the [[count of Barcelona]].  From the winter of 1124 to September 1125, he was on a risky expedition to Pe\u00f1a Cadiella deep in Andalusia. \n \n In the great raid of 1125, he carried away a large part of the subject Christians from Granada, and in the south-west of France, he had rights as king of Navarre. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  From 1125 to 1126, he was on campaign against [[Granada]], where he was trying to install a Christian prince, and [[C\u00f3rdoba (Spain)|C\u00f3rdoba]], where he got only as far as Motril.  In 1127, he reconquered Longares, but simultaneously lost all his Castilian possessions to [[alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII]].  He confirmed a treaty with Castile the next year (1128) with the [[Peace of T\u00e1mara]], which fixed the boundaries of the two realms. \n \n He conquered Molina de Arag\u00f3n and populated [[Monz\u00f3n]] in 1129, before besieging [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], which had fallen again upon the Cid's death. \n \n He went north of the Pyrenees in October 1130 to protect the [[Val d'Aran]].  Early in 1131, he besieged [[Bayonne]].  It is said he ruled  \" from Belorado to Pallars and from Bayonne to Monreal. \" \n \n At the [[Siege of Bayonne (1130\u201331)|siege of Bayonne]] in October 1131, three years before his death, he published a will leaving his kingdom to three autonomous religious orders based in Palestine and politically largely independent - the [[Knights Templars]], the [[Hospitallers]], and the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre|Knights of the Holy Sepulchre]], < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  whose influences might have been expected to cancel one another out. The will has greatly puzzled historians, who have read it as a bizarre gesture of extreme piety uncharacteristic of Alfonso's character, one that effectively undid his life's work. Elena Lourie (1975) suggested instead that it was Alfonso's attempt to neutralize the papacy's interest in a disputed succession \u2014 Aragon had been a fief of the Papacy since 1068 \u2014 and to fend off Urraca's son from her first marriage, Alfonso VII of Castile, for the Papacy would be bound to press the terms of such a pious testament.{{efn|[[Pope Innocent II]] indeed did write Alfonso VII to just this effect, 10 June 1135 or 36.{{sfn|Lourie|1975|p=645}}}} < /ref >  Generous bequests to important churches and abbeys in Castile had the effect of making the noble churchmen there beneficiaries who would be encouraged by the will to act as a brake on Alfonso VII's ambitions to break it \u2014 and yet among the magnates witnessing the will in 1131 there is not a single cleric. In the event it was a will that his nobles refused to carry out \u2014 instead bringing his brother Ramiro from the monastery to assume royal powers \u2014 an eventuality that Lourie suggests was Alfonso's hidden intent. \n \n His final campaigns were against Mequinenza (1133) and Fraga (1134), where [[Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of Navarre|Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez]], the future king of Navarre, and a mere 500 other knights fought with him.  It fell on 17 July. He was dead by September. His tomb is in the [[Abbey of San Pedro el Viejo|monastery of San Pedro]] in [[Huesca]]. \n \n ==Death== \n \n ===Succession=== \n [[File:A box (reliquary) of the bones (relics) of Alfonso the Battler.PNG|thumb|A box ([[reliquary]]) containing the bones ([[relics]]) of Alfonso the Battler, with the skull centre, facing the viewer. Photograph by Enrique Capella (May 1920).]] \n The testament of Alfonso leaving his kingdom to the three orders was dismissed out of hand by the nobility of his kingdoms, and possible successors were sought.  Alfonso's only brother, [[Ramiro II of Aragon|Ramiro]], had been a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monk since childhood, and his commitment to the church, his temperament and vow of celibacy made him ill-suited to rule a kingdom under constant military threat and in need of a stable line of succession. The step-son of the deceased king, [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n]], as reigning monarch and legitimate descendant of [[Sancho III of Navarre]], put himself forward but garnered no local support.  The nobility of Navarre aligned behind [[Pedro de Atar\u00e9s]], the grandson of Alfonso's illegitimate uncle, while the Aragonese nobility rallied around the abbot-bishop Ramiro.  A convention was called at [[Borja, Zaragoza|Borja]] to develop a consensus, but there Peter so alienated his own partisans with perceived arrogance that they abandoned him, yet were unwilling to accept Ramiro.  The convention broke up without arriving at a compromise and the two regional factions then acted independently. \n \n The choice of the Navarrese lords fell on [[Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of Navarre|Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez]], Lord of [[Monz\u00f3n]], descendant of an illegitimate son of [[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III of Navarre|Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III]] and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Alfonso VII to be their king. The Aragonese took Ramiro out of a monastery and made him king, marrying him without papal dispensation to Agnes, sister of the [[Duke of Aquitaine]], then betrothing their newborn daughter to [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]], who was then named Ramiro's heir.  \" The result of the crisis  produced by the result of Alfonso I's will was a major reorientation of the peninsula's kingdoms: the separation of Aragon and Navarre, the union of Aragon and Catalonia and \u2014 a moot point but stressed particularly by some Castilian historians \u2014 the affirmation of 'Castilian hegemony' in Spain \" {{sfn|Lourie|1975|p=645}} by the rendering of homage for [[Zaragoza]] by Alfonso's eventual heir, Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona. \n \n ===Pseudo-Alfonso the Battler=== \n Sometime during the reign of [[Alfonso II of Aragon]], the Battler's grandnephew, a man came forward claiming to be Alfonso the Battler. The only contemporary references to this event are two letters of Alfonso II addressed to [[Louis VII of France]]; they were carried to Louis by [[Berengar (Bishop of L\u00e9rida)|Berengar]], the [[Bishop of L\u00e9rida|Bishop of Lleida]], but are not dated. < ref > They were first published in the ''Recueil des Historiens des Gaules et de la France (Correspondance de Louis VII)'', XV (Paris: 1878), 2nd ed., n < sup > o < /sup > . 223\u20134, pp. 71\u20132, and utitised extensively by Marcelin Defourneaux,  \" Louis VII et le souverains espagnols. L'enigme du \u00abpseudo-Alphonse\u00bb \" , in ''Estudios dedicados a Men\u00e9ndez Pidal'', VI (Madrid: 1956), 647\u201361. They were published again by Ubieto Arteta (1958), appendices I and II, pp. 37\u20138. < /ref >  According to the second of these, the pretender was then living in Louis's domains, meaning the [[Principality of Catalonia]], which was ruled by Alfonso under Louis's suzerainty. This pretender was an old man (appropriately, since the Battler had died some decades earlier) and Alfonso II expressed confidence that Louis would arrest him at the earliest possible moment and bring him to justice. The first letter supplies sufficient information to date it approximately, since the Bishop sojourned at the court of Louis on his way to Rome. It is known from other sources that Berengar attended the [[Third Lateran Council]] in March 1179. The letters were probably written towards the end of 1178 or in January 1179 at the latest. < ref > Ubieto Arteta (1958), 35, cites the evidence for Aragon's early support for Alexander III against the [[Antipope Victor IV (1159\u20131164)|Antipope Victor IV]]. The earliest possible date at which Berengar could have been travelling to Rome to meet Alexander is after 23 November 1165, when the latter finally took up residence in Rome. < /ref >  According to an annalist source for the years 1089\u20131196, the pretender was received with honour and pomp in Zaragoza, Calatayud, and Daroca, which the Battler had conquered, but after it was found out that he was false he was executed before the city of Barcelona in 1181. < ref > Antonio C. Floriano,  \" Fragmentos de unos viejos anales (1089\u20131196). Transcripci\u00f3n y an\u00e1lisis paleogr\u00e1fico.

E dice muchas cosas que semeiavam verdat de lo passado quel havia fecho. E era tenido por senyer e por don Alfonso. E despues fue conoscido que non era aquel, e enforc\u00e1ronlo muy desonradament devant la ciudad de Barcelona. < /blockquote > < /ref >  Modern historian [[Antonio Ubieto Arteta]] has hypothesised that the Aragonese lords of the tenancies of Zaragoza, Calatayud, and Daroca \u2014 Pedro de Luesia, Loferrench de Luna, Pedro de Castillazuelo (lord of Calatayud), Pedro Cornel (lord of Murillo de G\u00e1llego), and the majordomo Jimeno de Artusilla, all of whom disappear between 1177 and 1181 in the documentation of their tenancies \u2014 supported, at least initially, the pretender. < ref > Ubieto Arteta (1958), note 24, who also connects the appearance of the pretender with the economic disasters that befell Aragon in 1174. < /ref >  These lords also appear in the later legend of the [[Bell of Huesca]], which has no historical basis, as the victims of Ramiro II (1136). Since, historically, they were not active in the 1130s, it is possible that the historically-based legend of the pseudo-Alfonso had some influence on the genesis of the Bell of Huesca. \n \n The earliest chronicle source for the imposture is [[Rodrigo Jim\u00e9nez de Rada]], writing in the middle of the thirteenth century, who records that there were several legends then current about the death of Alfonso the Battler: some believed he perished in the [[battle of Fraga]], some that his body had never been recovered, others that he was buried in the monastery of [[Castle of Montearag\u00f3n|Montearag\u00f3n]], and still others that he had fled from Fraga in shame after his defeat and became a pilgrim as an act of penance. Some years later, Rodrigo writes, though he does not give a year, an impostor arose and was received by many as the Battler, though Alfonso II had him arrested and hanged. This is the earliest reference to the impostor's end. < ref > The account in ''[[De rebus Hispaniae]]'' (Madrid: 1793), II, 150\u201351, quoted in Ubieto Arteta (1958), note 1: < blockquote > [Alfonsus] nam victus occiditur et si occisus inventus fuerit dubitatur. Ab aliquibus enim dicitur corpus eius in montis Aragonis monasterio tumulatum a mauris tamen ante redemptum. Ab aliis dicitur vivus a proelio evasisse et confusionem proelii nequiens tolerare peregrinum se exhibuit huic mundo effigie et habitu immutatus. Et annis aliquot interpositis, quispiam se ostendit qui se eumdem publice fatebatur et multorum Castellae et Aragoniae id ipsum testimonio affirmabant qui cum eo in utroque regno fuerant familiariter conversati et ad memoriam reducebant secreta plurima que ipse olim cum eis habita recolebat et antiquorum assertio ipsum esse firmiter asserebat. Demum tamen quia cum ex regno plurimi sectabantur et de die in diem eorum numerus augebatur. Aldefonsus rex Aragoniae fecit eum suspendio interire. < /blockquote > < /ref >  The legend was amplified in later years. According to the fourteenth-century  ''[[Cr\u00f3nica de los Estados Peninsulares]]'', the Battler went on a pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]], where he lived for many years. < ref > The account in the ''Cr\u00f3nica de los Estados Peninsulares: texto del siglo XIV'', ed. Antonio Ubieto Arteta (Granada: 1955), 128, quoted in Ubieto Arteta (1958), note 2: < blockquote > Otros dicen que de verg\u00fcenza que era vencido sent passo la mar a Jerusalem, pero nunca lo trobaron ni muerto ni vivo. Otros dicen que a tiempo vino en Aragon e fablo con algunos que sopieran de sus poridades. Otros que alli se perdio e non fue conoscido.. < /blockquote > < /ref >  The ''[[Cr\u00f3nica de San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a]]'' also recounts the incident, but it depends entirely on Rodrigo and the ''Estados Peninsulares''. It is not until the seventeenth-century historian [[Jer\u00f3nimo Zurita]] penned his ''Anales de la Corona de Arag\u00f3n'' that new details were added to the legend. < ref > Zurita's account is found in his second book, twenty-second chapter, and is completely recapitulated by Ubieto Arteta (1958), 29\u201330. < /ref >  Zurita dates the impostor's appearance to the death of [[Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona]], who had been exercising power in Aragon, and the succession of the child Alfonso II in 1162. The death of the impostor, by hanging, must have occurred in 1163. \n \n ==Competitors for succession == \n {{chart top|Family tree|width=100%|collapsed=no}} \n {{chart/start|align=center |summary=Candidates for the crowns of Navarre and Aragon in 1134.}} \n {{chart|border=0| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | may |v| sg3 |V| san |may=[[Muniadona of Castile|Muniadona of < br > Castile]] |sg3='''[[Sancho III of Pamplona|Sancho III < br > of Pamplona]]''' |san=Sancha < br > of Aybar}} \n {{chart|border=0| | | | | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|'| | | |L|~|~|~|7|}} \n {{chart|border=0| ste |v| gs3 |V| mis | | fer | | | | | | gar |v| ra1 |V| ama |ste=Stephanie < br > of < br > Barcelona |gs3='''[[Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III of Pamplona|Garc\u00eda < br > S\u00e1nchez III < br > of Pamplona]]'''|mis=''(mistress)''|fer='''[[Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n|Ferdinand I < br > of Le\u00f3n]]'''|gar=[[Ermesinda of Bigorre|Garsendis < br > of Foix]]|ra1='''[[Ramiro I of Aragon|Ramiro I < br >  of  < br > Aragon]]'''|ama=Amu\u00f1a}} \n {{chart|border=0| | | |!| | | |:| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |!| | | |L|~|~|~|7| |}} \n {{chart|border=0| | | sg4 | | sgu | | | | al6 | | | | fel |v| sr5 |v| isa | | srr | |sg4='''[[Sancho IV of Navarre|Sancho IV < br > of < br > Navarre]]'''|sgu=[[Sancho Garc\u00e9s, Lord of Uncastillo|Sancho < br > Garc\u00e9s of < br > Uncastillo]]|al6='''[[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VI < br > of Le\u00f3n < br > and Castile]]'''|isa=[[Isabella of Urgell|Isabella < br > of < br > Urgell]]|sr5='''[[Sancho Ram\u00edrez|Sancho < br > Ram\u00edrez < br > of Navarre < br > and Aragon]]'''|fel=[[Felicia of Roucy|Felicia < br > of < br >  Roucy]]|srr=[[Sancho Ram\u00edrez, Count of Ribagorza|Sancho < br > Ram\u00edrez < br > Count of < br > Ribagorza]]}} \n {{chart|border=0| | | | | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | |,|-|-|-|(| | | |!| | | | | |!| |}} \n {{chart|border=0| | | | | | | rsm | | | | urr |-| al1 | |ra2  | | pe1 | | | | gsr | |rsm=[[Ramiro S\u00e1nchez, Lord of Monz\u00f3n|Ramiro < br > S\u00e1nchez < br >  of Monz\u00f3n]]|urr='''[[Urraca of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Urraca < br > of Le\u00f3n < br > and Castile]]'''|al1='''Alfonso < br > the < br > Battler < br >  '''|ra2='''[[Ramiro II of Aragon|Ramiro II < br > of < br > Aragon]]''' |pe1='''[[Peter I of Aragon and Navarre|Peter I < br > of Navarre < br > and Aragon]]'''|gsr=Garc\u00eda < br > S\u00e1nchez < br > of Atar\u00e9s|boxstyle_ra2=background-color: #D2C9A2;}} \n {{chart|border=0| | | | | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |!| |}} \n {{chart|border=0| | | | | | |gar  | | | |al7  | | | | | | pet |-| rb4 | | | |pea  | |gar='''[[Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of Navarre|Garc\u00eda < br > Ram\u00edrez < br > of Navarre]]'''|al7='''[[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Alfonso VII < br > of Le\u00f3n < br > and Castile]]'''|pea=[[Pedro de Atar\u00e9s|Peter < br > of < br > Atar\u00e9s]]|pet=[[Petronilla of Aragon|Petronilla < br > of < br > Aragon]]|rb4=[[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona|Ramon < br > Berenguer IV < br > Count of < br > Barcelona]]|boxstyle_gar=background-color: #D2C9A2;|boxstyle_al7=background-color: #D2C9A2;|boxstyle_pea=background-color: #D2C9A2;}} \n {{chart/end}} \n \n {|style= \" border-spacing: 2px; border: 1px solid darkgray; \" \n |- \n | align= \" center \"  | {{legend|#D2C9A2|border=0px #555 solid}} \n | Candidates for the crowns of Navarre and Aragon in 1134 \n |- \n | {{chart/start}}{{chart|v}}{{chart/end}} \n | Marriage and legitimate descent \n |- \n | {{chart/start}}{{chart|V}}{{chart/end}} \n | Liaison and illegitimate descent \n |} \n {{chart bottom}} \n \n ==Notes== \n {{notelist}} \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist}} \n \n ==Sources== \n {{Commons category|Alfonso I of Aragon}} \n *{{cite book |chapter=Grants to Military Christian Orders |translator-first=James W. |translator-last=Brodman |pages=203\u2013208 |title=Medieval Iberia: Readings from Christian, Muslim, and Jewish Sources |editor-first1=Olivia Remie |editor-last1=Constable |editor-first2=Damian |editor-last2=Zurro |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2012 }} \n *{{cite journal |last=Lourie |first=Elena |title=The Will of Alfonso I, ''El Batallador'', King of Aragon and Navarre: A Reassessment. |journal=Speculum |volume=50:4 October |year=1975 |pages=635\u2013651 }} \n *{{cite book |first=Bernard F. |last=Reilly |title=The Contest of Christian and Muslim Spain, 1031-1157 |publisher=Blackwell |year=1995 }} \n *Ubieto Arteta, Antonio.
