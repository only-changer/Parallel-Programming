The language extensively uses the [[string (computer science)|string]] [[datatype]], [[associative array]]s (that is, arrays indexed by key strings), and [[regular expression]]s. While AWK has a limited intended [[Domain (software engineering)|application domain]] and was especially designed to support [[one-liner program]]s, the language is [[Turing-complete]], and even the early Bell Labs users of AWK often wrote well-structured large AWK programs. < ref > {{cite web \n | url         = http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch08s02.html#awk \n | title       = Applying Minilanguages \n | first       = Eric S. \n | last        = Raymond \n | author-link  = Eric S.

Weinberger]] (who worked on tiny relational databases), and [[Brian Kernighan]]; it takes its name from their respective initials. According to Kernighan, one of the goals of AWK was to have a tool that would easily manipulate both numbers and strings. \n AWK was also inspired by [[Marc Rochkind]]'s programming language that was used to search for patterns in input data, and was implemented using [[yacc]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT_J6xc-Az0 |title=UNIX Special: Profs Kernighan  &  Brailsford |work=Computerphile |date=September 30, 2015 }} < /ref > \n \n As one of the early tools to appear in [[Version 7 Unix]], AWK added computational features to a Unix [[pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]] besides the [[Bourne shell]], the only scripting language available in a standard Unix environment.

Both were designed for text processing. They share the line-oriented, data-driven paradigm, and are particularly suited to writing [[one-liner program]]s, due to the implicit [[main loop]] and current line variables. The power and terseness of early AWK programs \u2013 notably the powerful regular expression handling and conciseness due to implicit variables, which facilitate one-liners \u2013 together with the limitations of AWK at the time, were important inspirations for the [[Perl]] language (1987). In the 1990s, Perl became very popular, competing with AWK in the niche of Unix text-processing languages. \n \n == Structure of AWK programs == \n \n {{quote|AWK reads the input a line at a time. A line is scanned for each pattern in the program, and for each pattern that matches, the associated action is executed.|author= Alfred V. Aho < ref > {{cite web |first=Naomi |last=Hamilton |url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2535126/the-a-z-of-programming-languages--awk.html |title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: AWK |date=May 30, 2008 |work=[[Computerworld]] |access-date=2008-12-12}} < /ref > }} \n \n An AWK program is a series of pattern action pairs, written as: \n \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" awk \" > \n condition { action } \n condition { action } \n ... \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n where ''condition'' is typically an expression and ''action'' is a series of commands. The input is split into records, where by default records are separated by newline characters so that the input is split into lines. The program tests each record against each of the conditions in turn, and executes the ''action'' for each expression that is true. Either the condition or the action may be omitted. The condition defaults to matching every record. The default action is to print the record. This is the same pattern-action structure as sed. \n \n In addition to a simple AWK expression, such as  < code > foo == 1 < /code >  or  < code > /^foo/ < /code > , the condition can be  < code > BEGIN < /code >  or  < code > END < /code >  causing the action to be executed before or after all records have been read, or ''pattern1, pattern2'' which matches the range of records starting with a record that matches ''pattern1'' up to and including the record that matches ''pattern2'' before again trying to match against ''pattern1'' on future lines. \n \n In addition to normal arithmetic and logical operators, AWK expressions include the tilde operator,  < code > ~ < /code > , which matches a [[regular expression]] against a string. As handy [[syntactic sugar]], ''/regexp/'' without using the tilde operator matches against the current record; this syntax derives from [[sed]], which in turn inherited it from the [[Ed (text editor)|ed]] editor,  where  < code > / < /code >  is used for searching. This syntax of using slashes as [[delimiter]]s for regular expressions was subsequently adopted by [[Perl]] and [[ECMAScript]], and is now common. The tilde operator was also adopted by Perl. \n \n == Commands == \n \n AWK commands are the statements that are substituted for ''action'' in the examples above. AWK commands can include function calls, variable assignments, calculations, or any combination thereof. AWK contains built-in support for many functions; many more are provided by the various flavors of AWK. Also, some flavors support the inclusion of [[dynamically linked library|dynamically linked libraries]], which can also provide more functions. \n \n === The ''print'' command === \n \n The ''print'' command is used to output text. The output text is always terminated with a predefined string called the output record separator (ORS) whose default value is a newline. The simplest form of this command is: \n \n ;  < code > print < /code > \n :This displays the contents of the current record. In AWK, records are broken down into ''fields'', and these can be displayed separately: \n ;  < code > print $1 < /code > \n : Displays the first field of the current record \n ;  < code > print $1, $3 < /code > \n : Displays the first and third fields of the current record, separated by a predefined string called the output field separator (OFS) whose default value is a single space character \n \n Although these fields (''$X'') may bear resemblance to variables (the $ symbol indicates variables in [[Perl]]), they actually refer to the fields of the current record.  A special case, ''$0'', refers to the entire record.  In fact, the commands  \" < code > print < /code > \"  and  \" < code > print $0 < /code > \"  are identical in functionality. \n \n The ''print'' command can also display the results of calculations and/or function calls: \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" awk \" > \n /regex_pattern/ { \n     # Actions to perform in the event the record (line) matches the above regex_pattern \n     print 3+2 \n     print foobar(3) \n     print foobar(variable) \n     print sin(3-2) \n } \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n Output may be sent to a file: \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" awk \" > \n /regex_pattern/ { \n     # Actions to perform in the event the record (line) matches the above regex_pattern \n     print  \" expression \"   >   \" file name \" \n } \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n or through a [[pipe (Unix)|pipe]]: \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" awk \" > \n /regex_pattern/ { \n     # Actions to perform in the event the record (line) matches the above regex_pattern \n     print  \" expression \"  |  \" command \" \n } \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n === Built-in variables === \n \n Awk's built-in variables include the field variables: $1, $2, $3, and so on ($0 represents the entire record). They hold the text or values in the individual text-fields in a record. \n \n Other variables include: \n *  < code > NR < /code > : 'N'umber of 'R'ecords: keeps a current count of the number of input records read so far from all data files. It starts at zero, but is never automatically reset to zero. < ref name= \" GNU.org Records \" > https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Records.html#index-FNR-variable < /ref > \n *  < code > FNR < /code > : 'F'ile 'N'umber of 'R'ecords: keeps a current count of the number of input records read so far ''in the current file.'' This variable is automatically reset to zero each time a new file is started. < ref name= \" GNU.org Records \"  / > \n *  < code > NF < /code > : 'N'umber of 'F'ields: contains the number of fields in the current input record. The last field in the input record can be designated by $NF, the 2nd-to-last field by $(NF-1), the 3rd-to-last field by $(NF-2), etc. \n *  < code > FILENAME < /code > : Contains the name of the current input-file. \n *  < code > FS < /code > : 'F'ield 'S'eparator: contains the  \" field separator \"  character used to divide fields in the input record. The default,  \" white space \" , includes any space and tab characters. FS can be reassigned to another character to change the field separator. \n *  < code > RS < /code > : 'R'ecord 'S'eparator: stores the current  \" record separator \"  character. Since, by default, an input line is the input record, the default record separator character is a  \" newline \" . \n *  < code > OFS < /code > : 'O'utput 'F'ield 'S'eparator: stores the  \" output field separator \" , which separates the fields when Awk prints them. The default is a  \" space \"  character. \n *  < code > ORS < /code > : 'O'utput 'R'ecord 'S'eparator: stores the  \" output record separator \" , which separates the output records when Awk prints them. The default is a  \" newline \"  character. \n *  < code > OFMT < /code > : 'O'utput 'F'or'M'a'T': stores the format for numeric output. The default format is  \" %.6g \" . \n \n === Variables and syntax === \n \n Variable names can use any of the characters [A-Za-z0-9_], with the exception of language keywords. The operators ''+ - * /'' represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. For string [[concatenation]], simply place two variables (or string constants) next to each other. It is optional to use a space in between if string constants are involved, but two variable names placed adjacent to each other require a space in between. Double quotes [[delimit]] string constants. Statements need not end with semicolons. Finally, comments can be added to programs by using ''#'' as the first character on a line. \n \n === User-defined functions === \n \n In a format similar to [[C (programming language)|C]], function definitions consist of the keyword  < code > function < /code > , the function name, argument names and the function body.  Here is an example of a function. \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" awk \" > \n function add_three (number) { \n     return number + 3 \n } \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n This statement can be invoked as follows: \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" awk \" > \n (pattern) \n { \n    print add_three(36)     # Outputs '''39''' \n } \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n Functions can have variables that are in the local scope. The names of these are added to the end of the argument list, though values for these should be omitted when calling the function. It is convention to add some [[whitespace character|whitespace]] in the argument list before the local variables, to indicate where the parameters end and the local variables begin. \n \n == Examples == \n \n === Hello World === \n \n Here is the customary  \" [[ \" Hello, World! \"  program|Hello, world]] \"  program written in AWK: \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" awk \" > \n BEGIN { print  \" Hello, world! \"  } \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n Note that an explicit  < code > exit < /code >  statement is not needed here; since the only pattern is  < code > BEGIN < /code > , no command-line arguments are processed. \n \n === Print lines longer than 80 characters === \n \n Print all lines longer than 80 characters. Note that the default action is to print the current line. \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" awk \" > \n length($0)  >  80 \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n === Count words === \n \n Count words in the input and print the number of lines, words, and characters (like [[wc (Unix)|wc]]): \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" awk \" > \n { \n     words += NF \n     chars += length + 1 # add one to account for the newline character at the end of each record (line) \n } \n END { print NR, words, chars } \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n As there is no pattern for the first line of the program, every line of input matches by default, so the increment actions are executed for every line. Note that  < code > words += NF < /code >  is shorthand for  < code > words = words + NF < /code > . \n \n === Sum last word === \n \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" awk \" > \n { s += $NF } \n END { print s + 0 } \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n ''s'' is incremented by the numeric value of ''$NF'', which is the last word on the line as defined by AWK's field separator (by default, white-space). ''NF'' is the number of fields in the current line, e.g. 4. Since ''$4'' is the value of the fourth field, ''$NF'' is the value of the last field in the line regardless of how many fields this line has, or whether it has more or fewer fields than surrounding lines. $ is actually a unary operator with the highest [[operator precedence]]. (If the line has no fields, then ''NF'' is 0, ''$0'' is the whole line, which in this case is empty apart from possible white-space, and so has the numeric value 0.) \n \n At the end of the input the ''END'' pattern matches, so ''s'' is printed. However, since there may have been no lines of input at all, in which case no value has ever been assigned to ''s'', it will by default be an empty string. Adding zero to a variable is an AWK idiom for coercing it from a string to a numeric value. (Concatenating an empty string is to coerce from a number to a string, e.g. ''s  \" \" ''.  Note, there's no operator to concatenate strings, they're just placed adjacently.) With the coercion the program prints  \" 0 \"  on an empty input, without it an empty line is printed. \n \n === Match a range of input lines === \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" awk \" > \n NR % 4 == 1, NR % 4 == 3 { printf  \" %6d  %s\\n \" , NR, $0 } \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n The action statement prints each line numbered. The printf function emulates the standard C [[printf]] and works similarly to the print command described above. The pattern to match, however, works as follows: ''NR'' is the number of records, typically lines of input, AWK has so far read, i.e. the current line number, starting at 1 for the first line of input. ''%'' is the [[modulo operation|modulo]] operator. ''NR % 4 == 1'' is true for the 1st, 5th, 9th, etc., lines of input. Likewise, ''NR % 4 == 3'' is true for the 3rd, 7th, 11th, etc., lines of input. The range pattern is false until the first part matches, on line 1, and then remains true up to and including when the second part matches, on line 3. It then stays false until the first part matches again on line 5. \n \n Thus, the program prints lines 1,2,3, skips line 4, and then 5,6,7, and so on. For each line, it prints the line number (on a 6 character-wide field) and then the line contents. For example, when executed on this input: \n  Rome \n  Florence \n  Milan \n  Naples \n  Turin \n  Venice \n \n The previous program prints: \n       1 Rome \n       2 Florence \n       3 Milan \n       5 Turin \n       6 Venice \n \n ==== Printing the initial or the final part of a file ==== \n As a special case, when the first part of a range pattern is constantly true, e.g. ''1'', the range will start at the beginning of the input. Similarly, if the second part is constantly false, e.g. ''0'', the range will continue until the end of input. For example, \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" awk \" > \n  /^--cut here--$/, 0 \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n prints lines of input from the first line matching the regular expression ''^--cut here--$'', that is, a line containing only the phrase  \" --cut here-- \" , to the end. \n \n === Calculate word frequencies === \n \n [[Word frequency]] using [[associative array]]s: \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" awk \" > \n BEGIN { \n     FS= \" [^a-zA-Z]+ \" \n } \n { \n     for (i=1; i < =NF; i++) \n         words[tolower($i)]++ \n } \n END { \n     for (i in words) \n         print i, words[i] \n } \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n The BEGIN block sets the field separator to any sequence of non-alphabetic characters. Note that separators can be regular expressions. After that, we get to a bare action, which performs the action on every input line. In this case, for every field on the line, we add one to the number of times that word, first converted to lowercase, appears. Finally, in the END block, we print the words with their frequencies. The line \n  for (i in words) \n creates a loop that goes through the array ''words'', setting ''i'' to each ''subscript'' of the array. This is different from most languages, where such a loop goes through each ''value'' in the array. The loop thus prints out each word followed by its frequency count.  < code > tolower < /code >  was an addition to the One True awk (see below) made after the book was published. \n \n === Match pattern from command line === \n \n This program can be represented in several ways. The first one uses the [[Bourne shell]] to make a shell script that does everything. It is the shortest of these methods: \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" bash \" > \n #!/bin/sh \n \n pattern= \" $1 \" \n shift \n awk '/' \" $pattern \" '/ { print FILENAME  \" : \"  $0 }'  \" $@ \" \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n The  < code > $pattern < /code >  in the awk command is not protected by single quotes so that the shell does expand the variable but it needs to be put in double quotes to properly handle patterns containing spaces.  A pattern by itself in the usual way checks to see if the whole line ( < code > $0 < /code > ) matches.  < code > FILENAME < /code >  contains the current filename. awk has no explicit concatenation operator; two adjacent strings concatenate them.  < code > $0 < /code >  expands to the original unchanged input line. \n \n There are alternate ways of writing this. This shell script accesses the environment directly from within awk: \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" bash \" > \n #!/bin/sh \n \n export pattern= \" $1 \" \n shift \n awk '$0 ~ ENVIRON[ \" pattern \" ] { print FILENAME  \" : \"  $0 }'  \" $@ \" \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n This is a shell script that uses  < code > ENVIRON < /code > , an array introduced in a newer version of the One True awk after the book was published. The subscript of  < code > ENVIRON < /code >  is the name of an environment variable; its result is the variable's value. This is like the [[getenv]] function in various standard libraries and [[POSIX]]. The shell script makes an environment variable  < code > pattern < /code >  containing the first argument, then drops that argument and has awk look for the pattern in each file. \n \n < code > ~ < /code >  checks to see if its left operand matches its right operand;  < code > !~ < /code >  is its inverse. Note that a regular expression is just a string and can be stored in variables. \n \n The next way uses command-line variable assignment, in which an argument to awk can be seen as an assignment to a variable: \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" bash \" > \n #!/bin/sh \n \n pattern= \" $1 \" \n shift \n awk '$0 ~ pattern { print FILENAME  \" : \"  $0 }'  \" pattern=$pattern \"   \" $@ \" \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n Or You can use the ''-v var=value'' command line option (e.g. ''awk -v pattern= \" $pattern \"  ...''). \n \n Finally, this is written in pure awk, without help from a shell or without the need to know too much about the implementation of the awk script (as the variable assignment on command line one does), but is a bit lengthy: \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" awk \" > \n BEGIN { \n     pattern = ARGV[1] \n     for (i = 1; i  <  ARGC; i++) # remove first argument \n         ARGV[i] = ARGV[i + 1] \n     ARGC-- \n     if (ARGC == 1) { # the pattern was the only thing, so force read from standard input (used by book) \n         ARGC = 2 \n         ARGV[1] =  \" - \" \n     } \n } \n $0 ~ pattern { print FILENAME  \" : \"  $0 } \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n The  < code > BEGIN < /code >  is necessary not only to extract the first argument, but also to prevent it from being interpreted as a filename after the  < code > BEGIN < /code >  block ends.  < code > ARGC < /code > , the number of arguments, is always guaranteed to be \u22651, as  < code > ARGV[0] < /code >  is the name of the command that executed the script, most often the string  < code > \" awk \" < /code > . Also note that  < code > ARGV[ARGC] < /code >  is the empty string,  < code > \" \" < /code > .  < code > # < /code >  initiates a comment that expands to the end of the line. \n \n Note the  < code > if < /code >  block. awk only checks to see if it should read from standard input before it runs the command. This means that \n  awk 'prog' \n only works because the fact that there are no filenames is only checked before  < code > prog < /code >  is run! If you explicitly set  < code > ARGC < /code >  to 1 so that there are no arguments, awk will simply quit because it feels there are no more input files. Therefore, you need to explicitly say to read from standard input with the special filename  < code > - < /code > . \n \n == Self-contained AWK scripts == \n \n On Unix-like operating systems self-contained AWK scripts can be constructed using the [[shebang (Unix)|shebang]] syntax. \n \n For example, a script that prints the content of a given file may be built by creating a file named  < code > print.awk < /code >  with the following content: \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" awk \" > \n #!/usr/bin/awk -f \n { print $0 } \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n It can be invoked with:  < code > ./print.awk  < filename > < /code > \n \n The  < code > -f < /code >  tells AWK that the argument that follows is the file to read the AWK program from, which is the same flag that is used in sed. Since they are often used for one-liners, both these programs default to executing a program given as a command-line argument, rather than a separate file. \n \n == Versions and implementations == \n \n AWK was originally written in 1977 and distributed with [[Version 7 Unix]]. \n \n In 1985 its authors started expanding the language, most significantly by adding user-defined functions. The language is described in the book ''[[The AWK Programming Language]]'', published 1988, and its implementation was made available in releases of [[UNIX System V]]. To avoid confusion with the incompatible older version, this version was sometimes called  \" new awk \"  or ''nawk''. This implementation was released under a [[free software license]] in 1996 and is still maintained by Brian Kernighan (see external links below).{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n                             \n Old versions of Unix, such as [[UNIX/32V]], included  < code > awkcc < /code > , which converted AWK to C. Kernighan wrote a program to turn awk into C++; its state is not known. < ref > {{cite conference |first=Brian W. |last=Kernighan |date=April 24\u201325, 1991 |url=https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/btl.mirror/awkc++.pdf |title=An AWK to C++ Translator |event=Usenix C++ Conference |location=Washington, DC |pages=217\u2013228}} < /ref > \n \n * '''BWK awk''', also known as '''nawk''', refers to the version by [[Brian Kernighan]].

It was written before the original implementation became freely available. It includes its own debugger, and its [[profiling (computer programming)|profiler]] enables the user to make measured performance enhancements to a script. It also enables the user to extend functionality with shared libraries. Some [[Linux distribution]]s include ''gawk'' as their default AWK implementation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} \n ** '''gawk-csv'''.
