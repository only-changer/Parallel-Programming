In the Old Norse record, \u00c6gir hosts the gods in his halls and is associated with brewing ale. \u00c6gir is attested as married to a goddess, [[R\u00e1n]], who also personifies the sea, and together the two produced daughters who personify waves, the [[Nine Daughters of \u00c6gir and R\u00e1n]], and  \u00c6gir's son is [[Sn\u00e6r]], personified snow. \u00c6gir may also be the father of the beautiful j\u00f6tunn [[Ger\u00f0r]], wife of the god [[Freyr]], or these may be two separate figures who share the same name (see below and [[Gymir (father of Ger\u00f0r)]]). \n \n One of \u00c6gir's names, ''Hl\u00e9r'', is the namesake of the island [[L\u00e6s\u00f8]] (Old Norse ''Hl\u00e9ysey'' 'Hl\u00e9r's island') and perhaps also [[Lejre]] in [[Denmark]]. Scholars have long analyzed \u00c6gir's role in the Old Norse corpus, and the concept of the figure has had some influence in modern popular culture. \n \n == Names == \n The [[Old Norse]] name ''\u00c6gir'' ('sea') may stem from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*\u0101g < sup > w < /sup > i-jaz'' ('that of the river/water'),{{Sfn|Haudry|2017|pp=29\u201330}} itself a [[Morphological derivation|derivative]] of the root ''*ahw\u014d-'' ('river'; cf. [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''alva'' 'body of water, river', [[Old English]] ''\u0113a'' 'stream', [[Old High German]] ''aha'' 'river').{{Sfn|Kroonen|2013|p=7}} [[Richard Cleasby]] and [[Gu\u00f0brandur Vigf\u00fasson]] saw his name as deriving from an ancient [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] root. < ref name= \" CLEASBYVIGFUSSON758 \" > Cleasby, Vigf\u00fasson (1957:[http://web.ff.cuni.cz/cgi-bin/uaa_slovnik/gmc_search_v3?cmd=viewthis & id=cv:b0758:26 758]). < /ref >  Guus Kroonen argues that the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] root ''*ahw\u014d-'' is probably of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) origin, as it may be [[cognate]] with [[Latin]] ''aqua'' (via the common form ''*h\u2082ek\u02b7-eh\u2082-''), and ultimately descend from the PIE root ''*h\u2082ep''- ('water'; cf. [[Sanskrit]] ''\u00e1p-'' 'water' or [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] ''\u0101p-'' 'water, river').{{Sfn|Kroonen|2013|p=7}} \n \n The name ''\u00c6gir'' is identical to a noun for 'sea' in [[Skald|skaldic poetry]], itself a base word in many [[kenning]]s. For instance, a ship is described as  \" \u00c6gir's horse \"  and the waves as the  \" daughters of \u00c6gir \" .{{Sfn|Lindow|2002|p=47}} \n \n Poetic [[kenning]]s in both ''[[Hversu Noregr bygg\u00f0ist]]'' ('How Norway Was Settled') and ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' (The Language of Poetry) treat \u00c6gir and the sea-j\u00f6tunn Hl\u00e9r, who lives on the Hl\u00e9sey ('Hl\u00e9r island', modern [[L\u00e6s\u00f8]]), as the same figure.{{Sfn|de Vries|1956|p=251}}{{Sfn|Simek|1996|p=151}}{{Sfn|Lindow|2002|p=18}} \n \n The meaning of the [[Old Norse]] name ''Gymir'' is unclear.{{Sfn|de Vries|1962|p=197}}{{Sfn|Simek|1996|p=127}} Proposed translations include 'the earthly' (from Old Norse ''gumi''), 'the wintry one' (from ''gemla''), or 'the protector', the 'engulfer' (from ''geyma'').{{Sfn|de Vries|1962|p=197}}{{Sfn|Simek|1996|p=127}}{{Sfn|Orchard|1997|p=70}} (For more on this topic, see discussion below) \n \n == Attestations == \n [[File:Daughters of \u00c6gir and R\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|\u00c6gir, [[R\u00e1n]] and their [[Nine Daughters of \u00c6gir and R\u00e1n|Nine Daughters]] prepare a huge vat of [[ale]]. 19th-century Swedish [[book illustration]] of the [[Poetic Edda]].]] \n \u00c6gir is attested in a variety of Old Norse sources. \n \n ===''Sonatorrek''=== \n \u00c6gir and R\u00e1n receive mention in the poem ''[[Sonatorrek]]'' attributed to 10th century Icelandic [[skald]] [[Egill Skallagr\u00edmsson]]. In the poem, Egill laments the death of his son B\u00f6\u00f0var, who drowned at sea during a storm. In one difficult stanza, the skald expresses the pain of losing his son by invoking the image of slaying the personified sea, personified as \u00c6gir (Old Norse ''\u01eblsmi\u00f0[r]'' 'ale-smith') and R\u00e1n (''\u00c6gis man'' '\u00c6gir's wife'): \n {| \n | \n :Veiztu um \u03f8\u00e1 s\u01ebk \n :sver\u00f0i of r\u00e6kak, \n :var \u01eblsmi\u00f0[r] \n :allra t\u00edma; \n :hro\u00f0a v\u00e1gs br\u0153\u00f0r \n :ef vega m\u00e6ttak; \n :f\u0153ra ek andv\u00edgr \n :\u00c6gis mani.{{Sfn|Einarsson|2003|p=149}} \n | \n :You know, \n :if I took revenge with the sword \n :for that offence, \n :\u00c6gir would be dead; \n :if I could kill them, \n :I would fight \u00c6gir and R\u00e1n. < ref name= \" EINARSSON-2003 \" > Einarsson (2004:149). Formatted for display. < /ref > \n | \n |} \n \n The skald later references \u00c6gir by way of the kenning 'Hl\u00e9r's fire' (''Hl\u00e9s  viti''), meaning [[gold]].{{Sfn|Einarsson|2003|p=85}} \n \n ===''Poetic Edda''=== \n In the ''Poetic Edda'', \u00c6gir receives mention in the eddic poems ''[[Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l]]'', ''[[Hymiskvi\u00f0a]]'', ''[[Lokasenna]]'', and in the prose section of ''[[Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana I]]''.{{Sfn|Larrington|2014|p=324}} In ''Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l'', the disguised god Odin references \u00c6gir's status as a renowned host among the gods: \n \n :'Fleeting visions I have now revealed before the victory-gods's sons, \n :now the wished-for protection will awaken; \n :to the all the \u00c6sir it will become known, \n :on \u00c6gir's benches, \n :at \u00c6gir's feast.'{{Sfn|Larrington|2014|p=55, 290}} \n \n In ''Hymiskvi\u00f0a'', \u00c6gir plays a major role. In the poem, the gods have become thirsty after a successful hunt, and are keen to celebrate with drink. They  \" shook the twigs and looked at the [[augury]] \"  and  \" found that at \u00c6gir's was an ample choice of cauldrons \" .  Odin goes to \u00c6gir, who he finds sitting in good cheer, and tells him he shall  \" often prepare a feast for the \u00c6sir \" . Referring to \u00c6gir as a j\u00f6tunn, the poem describes how, now annoyed, \u00c6gir hatches a plan: He asks Thor to fetch a particular cauldron, and that with it he could brew ale for them all. The gods are unable to find a cauldron of a size big enough to meet \u00c6gir's request until the god [[T\u00fdr]] recommends one he knows of far away, setting the stage for the events of the rest of the poem.{{Sfn|Larrington|2014|p=74-75}} \n \n According to the prose introduction to ''Lokasenna'',  \" \u00c6gir, who is also called Gymir \" , was hosting a feast  \" with the great cauldron which has just been told about \" , which many of the gods and elves attended. The prose introduction describes the feast as featuring gold that shimmers like fire light and ale that serves itself, and that  \" it was a great place of peace \" . In attendance also were \u00c6gir's servers, [[Fimafeng]] and [[Eldir]]. The gods praise the excellence of their service and, hearing this, Loki murders Fimafeng, enraging the gods, who chase them out to the woods before returning to drink.{{Sfn|Larrington|2014|p=80}} \n \n In the poem that follows the prose introduction (and in accompanying prose), Loki returns to the hall and greets Eldir: He says that before Eldir steps forward, he should first tell him what the gods are discussing in the hall. Eldir says that they're discussing weaponry and war, and having nothing good to say about Loki. Loki says that he will enter \u00c6gir's halls and have a look at the feast, and with him bring quarrel and strife. Eldir notifies Loki that if he enters and causes trouble, he can expect them to return it to him. Loki enters the hall and the gods see him and become silent.{{Sfn|Larrington|2014|p=81}} \n \n In ''[[Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana I]]'', a great wave is referred to as  \" \u00c6gir's terrible daughter \" .{{Sfn|Larrington|2014|p=114}} \n \n ===''Prose Edda''=== \n \u00c6gir receives numerous mentions in the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'', where he sits at a banquet and asks the skaldic god [[Bragi]] many questions, and Bragi responds with narratives about the gods. The section begins as follows: \n {| \n | \n : < small > Anthony Faulkes translation (1987): < /small > \n :There was a person whose name was \u00c6gir or Hler. He lived on an island which is now called Hlesey. He was very skilled in magic. He set out to visit Asgard, and when the \u00c6sir became aware of his movements, he was given a great welcome, though many things had deceptive appearances.{{Sfn|Faulkes|1987|p=59}} \n | \n : < small > [[Andy Orchard]] translation (1997): < /small > \n There was a figure called \u00c6gir or Hl\u00e9r; he lived on an island, which is now called Hl\u00e9ysey. He was very crafty in magic. He set off to visit \u00c1sgard, and when the \u00c6sir realized he was coming, he was given a splen did welcome, although many things were not as they seemed;{{Sfn|Orchard|1997|p=1}} \n | \n : < small > [[John Lindow|J. Lindow]] translation (2002): < /small > \n :A man was named \u00c6gir or Hl\u00e9r; he lived on that island which is now called Hl\u00e9r\u2019s Island. He had much magic knowledge. He made his way to \u00c1sgard, but the \u00e6sir knew of his journey in advance. He was well received, but many things were done with illusions.{{Sfn|Lindow|2002|p=48}} \n | \n |} \n \n \n Beyond this section of ''Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l'', \u00c6gir receives several other mentions in [[kenning]]s. Section 25 provides examples for 'sea', including 'visitor of the gods', 'husband of R\u00e1n', 'father of \u00c6gir's daughters', 'land of R\u00e1n and \u00c6gir's daughters'. Kennings cited to [[skald]]s in this section include 'the storm-happy daughters of \u00c6gir' meaning 'waves' (Svein) and a kenning in a fragment of a work by the 11th century Icelandic skald [[Hofgar\u00f0a-Refr Gestsson]], where R\u00e1n is referred to as '[[Gymir (father of Ger\u00f0r)|Gymir]]'s ... [[v\u00f6lva]]': \n [[File:\u00c6gir, ruler of the ocean.jpg|thumb|An anonymous illustration of \u00c6gir published in 1901]] \n < blockquote > \n < small > Standardized [[Old Norse]] < /small > \n :''Ok sem kva\u00f0 Refr'': \n ::''F\u0153rir bj\u01ebrn, \u00fear er b\u00e1ra'' \n ::''brestr, undinna festa'' \n ::''opt \u00ed \u00c6gis kj\u01ebpta'' \n :: < nowiki > * < /nowiki > ''urs\u01ebl Gymis v\u01eblva''.{{Sfn|Faulkes|1998|p=37}} \n < /blockquote > \n < blockquote > \n < small > Anthony Faulkes translation < /small > \n :And as Ref said: \n ::Gymir's spray-cold sp\u00e6-wife often brings the twisted-rope-bear [ship] into \u00c6gir's jaws [under the waves] where the wave breaks. < ref name= \" FAULKES-1995-91-140 \" > Faulkes (1995 [1989]: 91). This stanza appears quoted a second time later in ''Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l'', for which see Faulkes (1995 [1989]: 140). < /ref > \n < /blockquote > \n The section's author comments that the stanza  \" [implies] that they are all the same, \u00c6gir and Hler and Gymir.{{Sfn|Faulkes|1998|p=92}} \n \n Chapter 33b of ''Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l'' discusses why skalds may refer to gold as  \" \u00c6gir's fire \" . The section traces the kenning to a narrative surrounding \u00c6gir, in which the j\u00f6tunn employs  \" glowing gold \"  in the center of his hall to light it  \" like fire \"  (which the narrator compares to flaming swords in [[Valhalla]]). The section explains that  \" Ran is the name of \u00c6gir's wife, and the names of their nine daughters are as was written above ... Then the \u00c6sir discovered that Ran had a net in which she caught everyone that went to sea ... so this is the story of the origin of gold being called fire or light or brightness of \u00c6gir, Ran or \u00c6gir's daughters, and from such kennings the practice has now developed of calling gold fire of the sea and of all terms for it, since \u00c6gir and Ran's names are also terms for the sea, and hence gold is now called fire of lakes or rivers and of all river-names. \" < ref name= \" FAULKES-1998-95 \" > Faulkes (1998:95). The chapter continues with discussion regarding the development of these kennings and the concept of allegory. < /ref > \n \n In chapter 61 provides yet more kennings. Among them the author notes that  \" Ran, who, it is said, was \u00c6gir's wife \"  and that  \" the daughters of \u00c6gir and Ran are nine \" .{{Sfn|Faulkes|1987|p=141}} In chapter 75, \u00c6gir occurs in a list of j\u00f6tnar.{{Sfn|Faulkes|1987|p=156}} \n \n ===Saga corpus=== \n In what appears to be a Norwegian genealogical tradition, \u00c6gir is portrayed as one of the three elements among the sea, the fire and the wind. The beginning of the ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]'' ('Saga of the Orkney Islanders') and ''[[Hversu Noregr bygg\u00f0ist|Hversu Noregr byggdisk]]'' ('How Norway Was Settled') tell that the j\u00f6tunn king [[Fornj\u00f3t]] had three sons: Hl\u00e9r ('sea'), whom he called \u00c6gir, a second named Logi ('fire'), and a third called K\u00e1ri ('wind').{{Sfn|Lindow|2002|p=48}} \n \n ==Scholarly reception and interpretation== \n ===Banquets=== \n Carolyne Larrington says that \u00c6gir's role in ''Hymiskvi\u00f0a''  \" may reflect Scandinavian royal practices in which the king enforces his authority on his subordinates by visiting their homes and demanding to be feasted \" .{{Sfn|Larrington|2014|p=74}} According to [[Andy Orchard]], \u00c6gir's role in ''Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l'', where he attends a banquet rather than hosting it, could be a deliberate inversion of the traditional motif of \u00c6gir as host.{{Sfn|Orchard|1997|p=1}} \n \n ===Gymir=== \n The name ''Gymir'' may indicate that \u00c6gir was understood as the father of the beautiful j\u00f6tunn [[Ger\u00f0r]] or indicate that two figures by the same name (see [[Gymir (father of Ger\u00f0r)]]). Both the prose introduction to ''[[Lokasenna]]'' and ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' state that \u00c6gir is also known as ''Gymir'', the father of the j\u00f6tunn [[Ger\u00f0r]].{{Sfn|Lindow|2002|p=156}} [[Rudolf Simek]] argues that, if understood to be two different entities, this may stem from an erroneous interpretation of kennings in which different j\u00f6tunn-names are used interchangeably.{{Sfn|Simek|1996|p=126-127}} \n \n ===Hl\u00e9r, L\u00e6s\u00f8, Lejre, and Snow === \n As highlighted above in ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'', the name of the island [[L\u00e6s\u00f8]] in [[Denmark]] references Hl\u00e9r (Old Norse ''Hl\u00e9ysey''  'Hl\u00e9r's Island'). Simek speculates that Hl\u00e9r may therefore have been seen as something of an ancestor of the island.{{Sfn|Simek|1996|p=151}} \n \n Two sources list the personified snow, [[Sn\u00e6r]] (Old Norse 'snow'), as Hl\u00e9r's son. Book nine of [[Saxo Grammaticus]]'s 12th century history of Denmark ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' contains mention of a figure by the name of ''Lerus'' (from Old Norse ''Hl\u00e9r'') whose son is ''Snio'' (from Old Norse ''Sn\u00e6r'' 'Snow'). The Danish chronicle of Lejre, ''[[Chronicon Lethrense]]'' also connects the two, and the name ''[[Lejre]]'' may, like ''L\u00e6s\u00f8'', derive from the j\u00f6tunn.{{Sfn|Simek|1996|p=151}} \n \n ===J\u00f6tunn=== \n Scholars have often discussed \u00c6gir's role as host to the gods and his description as a j\u00f6tunn. Anthony Faulkes observes that \u00c6gir is  \" often described by modern writers as god of the sea \"  yet that he is nowhere described as a god in the ''Prose Edda'' and appears in a list of j\u00f6tnar in ''Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l''.{{Sfn|Faulkes|1987|p=299}} According to John Lindow, since his wife R\u00e1n is listed among the \u00c1synjur (goddesses) in the same part of the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', and since he had a close and friendly relationship with the [[\u00c6sir]] (gods), \u00c6gir's description as a j\u00f6tunn appears questionable.{{Sfn|Lindow|2002|p=47}} Andy Orchard argues on the contrary that \u00c6gir's inclusion among the \u00c6sir is probably a late development since his daughters are described as j\u00f6tnar and some sources mention him as the descendant of the j\u00f6tunn [[Fornj\u00f3t]].{{Sfn|Orchard|1997|p=2}} According to [[Rudolf Simek]], while attested as a j\u00f6tunn, \u00c6gir  \" has characteristics \"  of a sea god \" .{{Sfn|Simek|1996|p=1}} \n \n ==Modern influence== \n [[File:Molin5.jpg|thumb|J. P. Molin's fountain relief featuring \u00c6gir and his nine daughters]] \n \u00c6gir has been the subject of a variety of art pieces These include [[Nils Blomm\u00e9r]]'s painting ''N\u00e4cken och \u00c4girs d\u00f6ttrar'' (1850), [[Johan Peter Molin]]'s (d. 1874) fountain relief ''\u00c6gir'', and [[Emil Doepler]]'s ''\u00c6gir'' (1901).{{Sfn|Simek|1996|p=2}} \n \n \u00c6gir is referenced in a variety of others ways in modern popular culture.
