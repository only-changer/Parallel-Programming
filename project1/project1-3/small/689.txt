A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish [[hatchery]].

Southern bluefin tuna are also caught in the wild and fattened in grow-out sea cages in southern [[Spencer Gulf]], [[South Australia]]. \n \n A similar process is used in the salmon-farming section of this industry; juveniles are taken from hatcheries and a variety of methods are used to aid them in their maturation. For example, as stated above, some of the most important fish species in the industry, salmon, can be grown using a cage system. This is done by having netted cages, preferably in open water that has a strong flow, and feeding the salmon a special food mixture that aids their growth. This process allows for year-round growth of the fish, thus a higher harvest during the correct seasons. < ref > {{cite journal |title=Farming the Sea|first=Frank|last=Asche|journal=Marine Resource Economics|volume=23|issue=4|year=2008|pages=527\u2013547 |jstor=42629678|doi=10.1086/mre.23.4.42629678|s2cid=129264961}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |title=Future Seascapes, Fishing, and Fish Farming|first1=Rebecca |last1=Goldburg |first2=Rosamond |last2=Naylor|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|volume=3|issue=1|date=February 2005|pages=21\u201328|doi=10.2307/3868441|jstor=3868441|doi-access=free}} < /ref >  An additional method, known sometimes as sea ranching, has also been used within the industry.

Global production reached more than 1.6 million tonnes in 2003, worth about US$9 billion. About 75% of farmed shrimp is produced in Asia, in particular in China and Thailand. The other 25% is produced mainly in Latin America, where Brazil is the largest producer. Thailand is the largest exporter. \n \n Shrimp farming has changed from its traditional, small-scale form in Southeast Asia into a global industry. Technological advances have led to ever higher densities per unit area, and [[broodstock]] is shipped worldwide. Virtually all farmed shrimp are [[penaeid]]s (i.e., shrimp of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Penaeidae]]), and just two species of shrimp, the [[Whiteleg shrimp|Pacific white shrimp]] and the [[giant tiger prawn]], account for about 80% of all farmed shrimp. These industrial [[monoculture]]s are very susceptible to disease, which has decimated shrimp populations across entire regions. Increasing [[ecology|ecological]] problems, repeated disease outbreaks, and pressure and criticism from both [[nongovernmental organization]]s and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late 1990s and generally stronger regulations.

This results from fish wastes and uneaten feed inputs. Elements of most concern are nitrogen and phosphorus which can promote algal growth, including harmful algal blooms which can be toxic to fish. Flushing times, current speeds, distance from the shore and water depth are important considerations when locating sea cages in order to minimize the impacts of nutrient enrichment on coastal ecosystems. \n \n The extent of the effects of pollution from sea-cage aquaculture varies depending on where the cages are located, which species are kept, how densely cages are stocked and what the fish are fed. Important species-specific variables include the species' food conversion ratio (FCR) and nitrogen retention. \n \n === Freshwater ecosystems === \n Whole-lake experiments carried out at the [[Experimental Lakes Area]] in Ontario, Canada have displayed the potential for cage aquaculture to source numerous changes in freshwater ecosystems.

Netherlands Business Support Office (Dalian), 2010. < /ref > \n \n ====Needs of the aquaculture sector in vaccines==== \n Aquaculture has an average annual growth rate of 9.2%, however the success and continued expansion of the fish farming sector is highly dependent on the control of fish pathogens including a wide range of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. In 2014, it was estimated that these parasites cost the global salmon farming industry up to 400 million Euros. This represents 6-10% of the production value of the affected countries, but it can go up to 20% (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2014). Since pathogens quickly spread within a population of cultured fish, their control is vital for the sector.  \n Historically, the use of antibiotics was against bacterial epizootics but production of animal proteins has to be sustainable, which means that preventive measures that are acceptable from a biological and environmental point of view should be used to keep disease problems in aquaculture at an acceptable level. So, this added to the efficiency of vaccines resulted in an immediate and permanent reduction in the use of antibiotics in the 90s. At the beginning there were fish immersion vaccines efficient against the vibriosis but proved ineffective against the furunculosis, hence the arrival of injectable vaccines: first water-based and after oil-based, much more efficient (Sommerset, 2005). \n \n ====Development of new vaccines==== \n It is the important mortality in cages among farmed fish, the debates around DNA injection vaccines, although effective, their safety and their side effects but also societal expectations for cleaner fish and security, lead research on new vaccine vectors. Several initiatives are financed by the European Union to develop a rapid and cost-effective approach to using bacteria in feed to make vaccines, in particular thanks to lactic bacteria whose DNA is modified (Boudinot, 2006). In fact, vaccinating farmed fish by injection is time-consuming and costly, so vaccines can be administered orally or by immersion by being added to feed or directly into water. This allows to vaccinate many individuals at the same time, while limiting the associated handling and stress. \n Indeed, many tests are necessary because the antigens of the vaccines must be adapted to each species or not present a certain level of variability or they will not have any effect. For example, tests have been done with 2 species: Lepeophtheirus salmonis (from which the antigens were collected) and Caligus rogercresseyi (which was vaccinated with the antigens), although the homology between the two species is important, the level of variability made the protection ineffective (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2014). \n \n ====Recent vaccines development in aquaculture==== \n There are 24 vaccines available and one for lobsters. The first vaccine was used in the USA against enteric red mouth in 1976. However, there are 19 companies and some small stakeholders are producing vaccines for aquaculture nowadays. The novel approaches are a way forward to prevent the loss of 10% aquaculture through disease. Genetically modified vaccines are not being used in the EU due to societal concerns and regulations. Meanwhile, DNA vaccines are now authorised in the EU (Adams, 2019).  \n There are challenges in fish vaccine development, immune response due to lack of potent adjScientists are considering microdose application in future. But there are also exciting opportunities in aquaculture vaccinology due to low cost of technology, regulations change and novel antigen expression and delivery systems. \n In Norway subunit vaccine (VP2 peptide) against infectious pancreatic necrosis is being used. In Canada, a licensed DNA vaccine against Infectious hematopoietic necrosis has been launched for industry use. \n Fish have large mucosal surfaces, so the preferred route is immersion, intraperitoneal and oral respectively. Nanoparticles are under progress for delivery purposes. The common antibodies produced are IgM and IgT. Normally booster is not required ifn Fish because more memory cells are produced in response to booster rather than increased level of antibodies. \n mRNA vaccines are alternative to DNA vaccines because they are more safe, stable, easily producible at large scale and mass immunization potential. Recently these are used in cancer prevention and therapeutics. Studies in rabies has shown that efficacy depends on dose and route of administration. These are still in infancy (Adams, 2019). \n \n ====Economic gains==== \n \n In 2014, the aquaculture produced fish overtook wild caught fish, in supply for human food. This means there is a huge demand for vaccines, in prevention of diseases. The reported annual loss fish, calculates to  > 10 billion usd. This is from approximately 10% of all fishes dying from infectious diseases. (Adams, 2019). \n The high annual losses increases the demand for vaccines. Even though there are about 24 traditionally used vaccines, there is still demand for more vaccines. The breakthrough of DNA-vaccines has sunk the cost of vaccines (Adams, 2019). \n \n The alternative to vaccines would be antibiotics and chemotherapy, which are more expensive and with bigger drawbacks. DNA-vaccines have become the most cost-efficient method of preventing infectious diseases. This bouts well for DNA-vaccines becoming the new standard both in fish vaccines, and in general vaccines (Ragnar Thorarinsson, 2021). \n \n ===Salinization/acidification of soils=== \n Sediment from abandoned aquaculture farms can remain hypersaline, [[acid]]ic and eroded. This material can remain unusable for aquaculture purposes for long periods thereafter. Various chemical treatments, such as adding [[Lime (material)|lime]], can aggravate the problem by modify the physicochemical characteristics of the sediment. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Martinez-Porchas|first1=Marcel|last2=Martinez-Cordova|first2=Luis R.|date=2012-04-29|title=World Aquaculture: Environmental Impacts and Troubleshooting Alternatives|journal=The Scientific World Journal|volume=2012|page=389623|doi=10.1100/2012/389623|issn=2356-6140|pmc=3353277|pmid=22649291}} < /ref > \n \n ==Ecological benefits== \n While some forms of aquaculture can be devastating to ecosystems, such as shrimp farming in mangroves, other forms can be very beneficial. Shellfish aquaculture adds substantial filter feeding capacity to an environment which can significantly improve water quality. A single oyster can filter 15 gallons of water a day, removing microscopic algal cells. By removing these cells, shellfish are removing nitrogen and other nutrients from the system and either retaining it or releasing it as waste which sinks to the bottom. By harvesting these shellfish the nitrogen they retained is completely removed from the system. < ref > {{cite journal|doi=10.2134/jeq2010.0203|pmid=21488516|title=Nutrient Bioassimilation Capacity of Aquacultured Oysters: Quantification of an Ecosystem Service|journal=Journal of Environmental Quality|volume=40|issue=1|pages=271\u20137|year=2011|last1=Higgins|first1=Colleen B.|last2=Stephenson|first2=Kurt|last3=Brown|first3=Bonnie L.}} < /ref >  Raising and harvesting kelp and other macroalgae directly remove nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus.

However, before any of this can be done researchers must study every aspect of the fish's lifecycle, including the amount of ammonia and nitrate the fish will tolerate in the water, what to feed the fish during each stage of its lifecycle, the [[stocking rate]] that will produce the healthiest fish, etc. < ref name= \" Growing Premium Seafood-Inland! \"  / > \n \n Some 16 countries now use [[geothermal energy]] for aquaculture, including China, [[Israel]], and the United States. < ref name= \" earth-policy \" > [http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/PB2/pb2ch10.pdf  \" Stabilizing Climate \" ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235731/http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/PB2/pb2ch10.pdf |date=2007-09-26 }} in Lester R.
