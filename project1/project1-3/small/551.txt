Species in this genus occur in southeast Asia.{{r|flow}} \n \n ==Description== \n Members of the genus are well known for having a pair of prolonged filaments at the tips of the forewings that arise near a pair of small glossy spots; this creates the impression of a pair of antennae, with corresponding  \" eyes \"  (a remarkable case of [[automimicry]]).{{r|wickler1968}} The  \" false head \"  effect is further reinforced by the bugs' habit of walking backwards when it detects movement nearby, so as to misdirect predators to strike at its rear, rather than at its actual head. \n \n ==Taxonomy== \n The genus ''Ancyra'' was first named in 1845 by Scottish zoologist [[Adam White (zoologist)|Adam White]].{{r|white1845|flow}} It is the only genus of the tribe Ancyrini (subfamily Platybrachinae, family Eurybrachidae).{{r|flowtribe}} The type species is ''[[Ancyra appendiculata]]'', the species name meaning ''bearing appendages''.{{r|flow|harris}} \n \n ===Species=== \n {{As of|2020}}, lists the following seven species in the genus ''Ancyra'':{{r|flow}} \n \n *''[[Ancyra annamensis]]'' {{small|Schmidt, 1908}} \u2013 Vietnam \n *''[[Ancyra appendiculata]]'' {{small|White, 1845}} \u2013 Myanmar \n *''[[Ancyra histrionica]]'' {{small|St\u00e5l, 1863}} \u2013 Cambodia, Myanmar \n *''[[Ancyra luangana]]'' {{small|Lallemand, 1928}} \n *''[[Ancyra nigrifrons]]'' {{small|Schmidt, 1908}} \u2013 Malaysia \n *''[[Ancyra vicina]]'' {{small|Lallemand, 1928}} \u2013 Vietnam \n *''[[Ancyra xiengana]]'' {{small|Lallemand, 1928}} \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist|refs= \n < ref name=flow > Bourgoin Th. 2019.
