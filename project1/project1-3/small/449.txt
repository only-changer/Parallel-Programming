D. Dunbabin, ''Mosaics of the Greek and Roman World'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 136, 142, 276\u2013277. < /ref >  In the myth of [[Lycurgus of Thrace|Lycurgus]], the king attacked Ambrosia and Dionysus' entourage, causing the god to drive Lycurgus insane. \n \n ==Definition== \n {{For|its Indian equivalent|Amrita}} \n Ambrosia is very closely related to the gods' other form of sustenance, ''[[Nectar#Etymology|nectar]]''. The two terms may not have originally been distinguished; < ref > \" Attempts to draw any significant distinctions between the functions of nectar and ambrosia have failed. \"  Clay, p. 114. < /ref >  though in [[Homer]]'s poems nectar is usually the drink and ambrosia the food of the gods; it was with ambrosia Hera  \" cleansed all defilement from her lovely flesh \" , < ref > [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' xiv.170 < /ref >  and with ambrosia Athena prepared [[Penelope]] in her sleep, < ref > [[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' xviii.188ff < /ref >  so that when she appeared for the final time before her suitors, the effects of years had been stripped away, and they were inflamed with passion at the sight of her. On the other hand, in [[Alcman]], < ref > [[Alcman]], fragment 42 < /ref >  nectar is the food, and in [[Sappho]] < ref > [[Sappho]], fragment 141 LP < /ref >  and [[Anaxandrides]], ambrosia is the drink. < ref > When Anaxandrides says  \" I eat nectar and drink ambrosia \" , though, Wright, p. 5, suggested he was using comic inversion. < /ref >  A character in [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[The Knights|Knights]]'' says,  \" I dreamed the goddess poured ambrosia over your head\u2014out of a ladle. \"  Both descriptions could be correct, as ambrosia could be a liquid considered a food (such as [[honey]]). \n \n The consumption of ambrosia was typically reserved for divine beings. Upon his assumption into immortality on Olympus, [[Heracles]] is given ambrosia by [[Athena]], while the hero [[Tydeus]] is denied the same thing when the goddess discovers him eating human brains. In one version of the myth of [[Tantalus]], part of Tantalus' crime is that after tasting ambrosia himself, he attempts to steal some to give to other mortals. < ref > [[Pindar]], ''Olympian Odes'' 1. 50. ff. < /ref >  Those who consume ambrosia typically have [[ichor]], not blood, in their veins. < ref > [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' v. 340, 416. < /ref > \n \n Both nectar and ambrosia are fragrant, and may be used as [[perfume]]: in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' Menelaus and his men are disguised as seals in untanned seal skins,  \" ...and the deadly smell of the seal skins vexed us sore; but the goddess saved us; she brought ambrosia and put it under our nostrils. \" < ref > [[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' iv.444\u201346 < /ref >  Homer speaks of ambrosial raiment, ambrosial locks of hair, even the gods' ambrosial sandals. \n \n Among later writers, ambrosia has been so often used with generic meanings of  \" delightful liquid \"  that such late writers as [[Athenaeus]], [[Saint Paul|Paulus]] and [[Dioscurides]] employ it as a technical terms in contexts of cookery, < ref name= \" ReferenceA \" > In Athenaeus, a sauce of oil, water and fruit juice. < /ref >  medicine, < ref name= \" In Paulus, a medicinal draught \" > In Paulus, a medicinal draught. < /ref >  and botany. < ref name= \" ReferenceB \" > Dioscurides remarked its Latin name was ''ros marinus'',  \" sea-dew \" , or [[rosemary]]; these uses were noted by Wright 1917:6. < /ref >  [[Pliny's Natural History|Pliny]] used the term in connection with different plants, as did early herbalists. < ref name=Chambers > \" Ambrosia \"  in ''[[Chambers's Encyclop\u00e6dia]]''. London: [[George Newnes Ltd|George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 315. < /ref > \n \n Additionally, some modern [[Ethnomycology|ethnomycologists]], such as [[Danny Staples]], identify ambrosia with the [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] mushroom ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'':  \" ...it was the food of the gods, their ambrosia, and nectar was the pressed sap of its juices \" , Staples asserts. < ref name= \" ReferenceC \" > Carl A.P. Ruck and Danny Staples, ''The World of Classical Myth'' 1994:26. < /ref > \n \n [[W. H. Roscher]] thinks that both nectar and ambrosia were kinds of honey, in which case their power of conferring immortality would be due to the supposed healing and cleansing powers of honey, < ref name=EB1911/ >  and because fermented honey ([[mead]]) preceded [[wine]] as an [[entheogen]] in the Aegean world; on some Minoan seals, goddesses were represented with [[bee]] faces (compare [[Merope (Pleiades)|Merope]] and [[Melissa]]). \n \n == Etymology == \n The concept of an immortality drink is attested in at least two ancient [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] languages: Greek and [[Sanskrit]]. The Greek \u1f00\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 (''ambrosia'') is semantically linked to the Sanskrit {{lang-sa2|\u0905\u092e\u0943\u0924}} (''[[am\u1e5bta]]'') as both words denote a drink or food that gods use to achieve immortality. The two words appear to be derived from the same Indo-European form *''\u1e47-m\u1e5b-t\u00f3s'',  \" un-dying \" < ref name= \" eiec \" > {{Cite encyclopedia |first=J. P. |last1=Mallory |editor-first1=J.

A semantically similar etymology exists for [[Nectar#Etymology|nectar]], the beverage of the gods (Greek: \u03bd\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1 ''n\u00e9ktar'') presumed to be a compound of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] roots ''*nek-'',  \" death \" , and ''-*tar'',  \" overcoming \" . \n \n == Other examples in mythology == \n [[File:Johann Balthasar Probst 002.jpg|thumb|Thetis anoints Achilles with ambrosia, by [[Johann Balthasar Probst]] (1673\u20131748)]] \n * In one version of the story of the birth of [[Achilles]], [[Thetis]] anoints the infant with ambrosia and passes the child through the fire to make him immortal but [[Peleus]], appalled, stops her, leaving only his heel unimmortalised (''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.869\u2013879). \n * In the ''[[Iliad]]'' xvi, [[Apollo]] washes the black blood from the corpse of [[Sarpedon (Trojan War hero)|Sarpedon]] and anoints it with ambrosia, readying it for its dreamlike return to Sarpedon's native [[Lycia]]. Similarly, [[Thetis]] anoints the corpse of [[Patroclus]] in order to preserve it. Ambrosia and nectar are depicted as [[unguent]]s (xiv. 170; xix. 38). \n * In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]] is described as having  \" spread a table with ambrosia and set it by [[Hermes]], and mixed the rosy-red nectar. \"   It is ambiguous whether he means the ambrosia itself is rosy-red, or if he is describing a rosy-red nectar Hermes drinks along with the ambrosia.  Later, [[Circe]] mentions to [[Odysseus]] < ref > ''Odyssey'' xii.62:  \" the trembling doves that carry ambrosia to Father Zeus. \" < /ref >  that a flock of doves are the bringers of ambrosia to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]]. \n * In the ''Odyssey'' (ix.345\u2013359), [[Polyphemus]] likens the wine given to him by [[Odysseus]] to ambrosia and nectar. \n * One of the impieties of [[Tantalus]], according to [[Pindar]], was that he offered to his guests the ambrosia of the Deathless Ones, a theft akin to that of [[Prometheus]], [[Karl Kerenyi]] noted (in ''Heroes of the Greeks''). < ref > {{cite book |last=Ker\u00e9nyi |first=Carl |title=Prometheus: Archetypal Image of Human Existence |url={{GBurl|ouOmOC6Z1HkC|p=42}} |page=42 }} < /ref > \n * In the [[Homeric hymn]] to [[Aphrodite]], the goddess uses  \" ambrosial bridal oil that she had ready perfumed. \" < ref > {{cite book|last1=West|first1=Martin L.|title=Homeric hymns; Homeric apocrypha; Lives of Homer|date=2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780674996069|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/homerichymnshome0000home}} < /ref > \n * In the story of ''[[Cupid and Psyche]]'' as told by [[Apuleius]], Psyche is given ambrosia upon her completion of the quests set by [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and her acceptance on Olympus.
