Place some small lumps of calcium carbide (about 15 g.) in a 150 ml. distilling-flask (or in a Buchner flask of similar capacity), and fit into the neck of the flask a tall dropping-funnel the stem of which has been drawn off to a fine point: the stem should pass well down below the side arm of the flask. Connect this side arm to a wash-bottle containing 10% aqueous copper sulphate solution: the tall dropping funnel is thus required in order to give a sufficient  \" head \"  of water in the funnel to force the acetylene through the wash-bottle. Then fit to the wash-bottle a delivery-tube which passes into a pneumatic trough precisely.Fill the dropping-funnel with water, and allow the latter to fall drop by drop on to the calcium carbide: acetylene is at once generated, and on passing through the copper sulphate solution is freed from hydrogen sulphide, etc. Allow the gas to escape from the delivery-tube in the pneumatic trough until the issuing gas smells markedly of acetylene. Then collect a sample of the gas in a small test-tube precisely as described for ethylene. Ignite the sample at a burner placed as before at a safe distance from the apparatus. If the air in the apparatus has not yet been completely displaced, the sample of gas will explode with a sharp report: if, however, the acetylene is free from air, it will burn quietly with a very smoky flame depositing carbon in the tube, in marked contrast to the clear flame of burning ethylene. \" < ref > MANN, F.

[[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|Oxy-acetylene welding]] was a popular welding process in previous decades. The development and advantages of [[arc welding|arc-based welding processes]] have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly. On the other hand, oxy-acetylene welding ''equipment'' is quite versatile \u2013 not only because the torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications. [[Bell Canada]] cable-repair technicians still use portable acetylene-fuelled torch kits as a [[soldering]] tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in [[manhole]]s and in some aerial locations. Oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible. Oxy-acetylene cutting is used in many metal fabrication shops.

Natural acetylene is believed to form from [[Catalysis|catalytic]] decomposition of long-chain hydrocarbons at temperatures of {{convert|1700|K|C F}} and above. Since such temperatures are highly unlikely on such a small distant body, this discovery is potentially suggestive of catalytic reactions within that moon, making it a promising site to search for prebiotic chemistry. < ref > {{cite web|publisher=[[The Planetary Society]] |author =Emily Lakdawalla |title=LPSC: Wednesday afternoon: Cassini at Enceladus |date=17 March 2006 |url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000498/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220053655/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000498/ |archive-date=2012-02-20 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=445 | pages=376\u2013377| date= 25 January 2007| doi = 10.1038/445376b| title= Planetary science: Inside Enceladus|author1=John Spencer |author2=David Grinspoon |pmid=17251967|issue=7126| s2cid=4427890 | doi-access=free}} < /ref > \n \n ==Reactions== \n ===Vinylation: hydration, hydrohalogenation, and related reactions=== \n In '''vinylation''' reactions, H-X compounds add across the triple bond.

The reaction is catalyzed by mercury salts.  This reaction once was the dominant technology for acetaldehyde production, but it has been displaced by the [[Wacker process]], which affords acetaldehyde by oxidation of [[ethylene]], a cheaper feedstock.  A similar situation applies to the conversion of acetylene to the valuable [[vinyl chloride]] by [[hydrochlorination]] vs the [[oxychlorination]] of ethylene. \n \n ===Addition to formaldehyde=== \n Acetylene adds to ketones and aldehydes in the presence of base catalysts.

It is also highly flammable, as are most light hydrocarbons, hence its use in welding. Its most singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability, especially when it is pressurized: under certain conditions acetylene can react in an [[exothermic]] addition-type reaction to form a number of products, typically [[benzene]] and/or [[vinylacetylene]], possibly in addition to [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Consequently, acetylene, if initiated by intense heat or a shockwave, can decompose explosively if the absolute pressure of the gas exceeds about {{convert|200|kPa|psi}}. Most regulators and pressure gauges on equipment report [[gauge pressure]], and the safe limit for acetylene therefore is 101 & nbsp;kPa < sub > gage < /sub > , or 15 & nbsp;psig. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.c-f-c.com/specgas_products/acetylene.htm | title = Acetylene Specification | access-date = 2012-05-02 | publisher = CFC StarTec LLC}} < /ref > < ref name= \" :0 \" > {{Cite web|url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/cfr/ibr/003/cga.g-1.2009.pdf|title=law.resource.org CGA g-1 2009 (incorporated by reference)|access-date=2016-11-30}} < /ref >  It is therefore supplied and stored dissolved in [[acetone]] or [[dimethylformamide]] (DMF), < ref name= \" :0 \"  / > < ref name= \" Industrial Gases \" > {{cite book | last1 = Downie | first1 = N.
