The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition, when cleric [[Gjon Buzuku]] brought into the Albanian language the [[Catholic liturgy]], trying to do for the Albanian language, what [[Martin Luther]] did for the German language. [[Meshari]] (''The Missal'') written by [[Gjon Buzuku]] was published in 1555 and is considered as one of the first literary work of written Albanian during the Middle Ages. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century. \n The earliest evidence dates from 1332 & nbsp;AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, [[Archbishop]] of [[Antivari]], who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin. Other significant examples include: a [[Formula e pag\u00ebzimit|baptism formula]] (''Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit'') from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of [[Durr\u00ebs]], [[Pal Engj\u00eblli]]; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment of the Bible from the [[Gospel of Matthew]], also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters. \n \n [[File:Parashqevi-qirjazi_152_186.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Parashqevi Qiriazi]] - teacher and feminist (1880\u20131970)]] \n \n Albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist [[Marin Barleti]], who in his book [[Siege of Shkodra (1478)#The Book|Siege of Shkod\u00ebr]] (''Rrethimi i Shkodr\u00ebs'') from 1504, confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (''in vernacula lingua'') as well as his famous biography of [[Skanderbeg]] [[Marin Barleti|Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis]] (''History of Skanderbeg'') from 1508. The ''History of Skanderbeg'' is still the foundation of Skanderbeg studies and is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national self-consciousness. \n \n During the 16th and the 17th centuries, the [[catechism]] (''E mb\u00ebsuame krishter\u00eb'') (Christian Teachings) from 1592 written by [[Lek\u00eb Matr\u00ebnga]], (''Doktrina e krishter\u00eb'') (The Christian Doctrine) from 1618 and (''Rituale romanum'') 1621 by [[Pjet\u00ebr Budi]], the first writer of original Albanian [[prose]] and poetry, an [[Remorse|apology]] for George Castriot (1636) by [[Frang Bardhi]], who also published a dictionary and [[folklore]] creations, the theological-philosophical treaty ''[[Cuneus Prophetarum]]'' (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]], the most universal personality of Albanian [[Middle Ages]], were published in [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. The most famous Albanian writer in the 20th and 21st century is probably [[Ismail Kadare]]. He has been mentioned as a possible recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature several times. \n \n === Sports === \n {{See also|Albania at the Olympics|Albania at the Mediterranean Games}} \n \n [[File:Lorik cana crop.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Lorik Cana]] is Albania's most capped player of all time. He captained the French [[Olympique de Marseille]], as well as the [[Albania national football team|Albanian national team]].]] \n \n Albania participated at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games in 1972]] for the first time. The country made their Winter Olympic Games debut in [[Winter Olympics 2006|2006]]. Albania missed the next four games, two of them due to the 1980 and 1984 boycotts, but returned for the 1992 games in [[1992 Olympic Winter Games|Barcelona]]. Since then, Albania have participated in all games. Albania normally competes in events that include swimming, athletics, weightlifting, shooting and wrestling. The country have been represented by the [[National Olympic Committee of Albania]] since 1972. The nation has participated at the [[Mediterranean Games]] since the games of [[1987 Mediterranean Games|1987]] in Syria. The Albanian athletes have won a total of 43 (8 gold, 17 silver and 18 bronze) medals from [[1987 Mediterranean Games|1987]] to [[2013 Mediterranean Games|2013]]. \n \n [[File:Muzeu_Arkeologjike_Tirane.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arena Komb\u00ebtare]] in central Tirana]] \n \n Popular sports in Albania include [[Football in Albania|Football]], weightlifting, [[Albania national basketball team|basketball]], volleyball, tennis, swimming, [[rugby union]] and gymnastics. Football is by far the most popular sport in Albania. It is governed by the [[Football Association of Albania]] ({{lang-sq|Federata Shqiptare e Futbollit}}, F.SH.F.), which was created in 1930 and has membership in [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]]. Football arrived in Albania early in the 20th century when the inhabitants of the northern city of [[Shkod\u00ebr]] were surprised to see a strange game being played by students at a Christian mission. \n \n The [[Albania national football team]], ranking 51st in the [[FIFA World Rankings|World]] in 2017 (highest 22nd on 22 August 2015) have won the [[1946 Balkan Cup]] and the [[Rothmans International Tournament 2000|Malta Rothmans International Tournament 2000]], but had never participated in any major [[UEFA]] or [[FIFA]] tournament, until [[UEFA Euro 2016]], Albania's first ever appearance at the continental tournament and at a major men's football tournament. Albania scored their first ever goal in a major tournament and secured their first ever win in European Championship when they beat [[Romania national football team|Romania]] by 1\u20130 in a [[UEFA Euro 2016]] match on 19 June 2016. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/06/19/albania-vs-romania-euro-2016---live/|title=Euro 2016: Albania 0\u20131 Romania \u2013 Armando Sadiku scores the only goal to seal his country's first ever win at a major competition|work=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 June 2016|access-date=19 June 2016|last1=Amofa|first1=Richard}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/romania-0-1-albania-armando-8233364|title=Romania 0\u20131 Albania \u2013 Sadiku scores landmark goal to provide last 16 hope |date=19 June 2016 |work=Daily Mirror |access-date=19 June 2016}} < /ref >  The most successful football clubs in the country are [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu]], [[KF Tirana]], [[FK Dinamo Tirana|Dinamo Tirana]], [[FK Partizani Tirana|Partizani]] and [[KF Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Vllaznia]]. \n \n Weightlifting is one of the most successful individual sport for the Albanians, with the national team winning medals at the [[European Weightlifting Championships]] and the rest international competitions. Albanian weightlifters have won a total of 16 medals at the [[European Weightlifting Championships|European Championships]] with 1 of them being gold, 7 silver and 8 bronze. In the [[World Weightlifting Championships]], the Albanian weightlifting team has won in [[1972 World Weightlifting Championships|1972]] a gold in [[2002 World Weightlifting Championships|2002]] a silver and in [[2011 World Weightlifting Championships|2011]] a bronze medal. \n {{Clear}} \n \n === Diaspora === \n {{Main|Albanian diaspora|Category:Albanian diaspora|l2=Albanian communities}} \n \n Historically, the Albanian people have established several communities in many regions throughout Southern Europe. The [[Albanian diaspora]] has been formed since the late [[Middle Ages]], when they emigrated to places such as Italy, especially in [[Sicily]] and [[Calabria]], and [[Greece]] to escape either various socio-political difficulties or the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman conquest]] of Albania. < ref > {{cite book|title=Historia e popullit shqiptar|author=Stafi i Akedemise se Shkencave|year=2003|publisher=Botimet Toena|pages=252\u2013254}} < /ref >  Following the [[Fall of communism in Albania|fall of communism]], large numbers of Albanians have migrated to countries such as Australia, Canada, France, Germany, [[Greece]], Italy, [[Scandinavia]], [[Switzerland]], United Kingdom and the United States. Albanian [[Minority group|minorities]] are present in the neighbouring territories such as the west of [[North Macedonia]], the east of [[Montenegro]], [[Kosovo]] in its entirety and southern [[Serbia]]. In [[Kosovo]], Albanians make up the largest ethnic group in the country. Altogether, the number of ethnic Albanian living abroad its territory is estimated to be higher than the total population inside the territory of Albania. \n \n == See also == \n * [[Outline of Albania]] \n * [[Index of Albania-related articles]] \n * [[Bibliography of Albania]] \n \n == Notes == \n {{notes \n  |notes={{efn|name=status|{{Kosovo-note}}}} \n }} \n \n == References == \n {{reflist}} \n \n == Further reading == \n {{Refbegin}} \n * ''History of the Party of Labor of Albania''.
