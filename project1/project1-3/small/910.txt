It was the last private residence designed by architect [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]] and was built between 1906 and 1912. \n \n The building was commissioned in 1906 by {{illm|Pere Mil\u00e0|ca|Pere Mil\u00e0 i Camps|es|Pere Mil\u00e0 i Camps}} and his wife {{illm|Roser Segimon|ca|Roser Segimon i Artells|es|Roser Segimon i Artells}}.

In September, they commissioned Gaud\u00ed for building them a new house with the idea of living in the main floor and renting out the rest of the apartments. On February 2, 1906, the project was presented to the Barcelona City Council and the works began, demolishing the pre-existing building instead of reforming it, as in the case of the [[Casa Batll\u00f3]]. < ref name= \" :0 \" > {{Cite web|url=http://pedreraeducacio.lapedrera.com/eng/index.htm|title=Cronology of La Pedrera (A place of memory)}} < /ref > \n \n The building was completed in December 1910 and the owner asked Gaud\u00ed to make a certificate to inhabit the main floor, which the City Council authorized in October 1911, and the couple moved in.

The work was done by the architects Joseph Emilio Hern\u00e1ndez-Cros and Rafael Vila. < ref name= \" Restoration \" / >  The renovated main floor opened in 1990 as part of the [[Cultural Olympiad]] of Barcelona. The floor became an exhibition room with an example of [[modernism]] in the [[Eixample]]. < ref name=huertas/ > \n \n == Design == \n The building is 1,323 m < sup > 2 < /sup >  per floor on a plot of 1,620 m < sup > 2 < /sup > . Gaud\u00ed made the first sketches in his workshop in the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]]. He designed the house as a constant curve, both outside and inside, incorporating [[ruled surface|ruled geometry]] and naturalistic elements. \n \n [[File:Casa Mila-panoramic.jpg|thumb|right|The courtyard]] \n Casa Mil\u00e0 consists of two buildings, which are structured around two courtyards that provide light to the nine stories: basement, ground floor, mezzanine, main (or noble) floor, four upper floors, and an attic. The basement was intended to be the garage, the main floor the residence of the Mil\u00e0s (a flat of all 1,323 m < sup > 2 < /sup > ), and the rest distributed over 20 apartments. The resulting layout is shaped like an asymmetrical  \" 8 \"  because of the different shapes and sizes of the courtyards. The attic housed the laundry and drying areas, forming an insulating space for the building and simultaneously determining the levels of the roof. \n \n One of the most notable elements of the building is the roof, crowned with skylights, staircase exits, fans, and chimneys. All of these elements, constructed out of brick covered with lime, [[trencad\u00eds|broken marble, or glass]] have a specific architectural function but are also real sculptures integrated into the building. \n \n The apartments feature plastered ceilings with dynamic reliefs, handcrafted wooden doors, windows, and furniture, as well as [[hydraulic tile]]s and various ornamental elements. \n \n The stairways were intended as service entries, with the main access to the apartments by elevator except for the noble floor, where Gaud\u00ed added a prominent interior staircase. Gaud\u00ed wanted the people who lived in the flats to all know each other. Therefore, there were only elevators on every other floor, so people on different floors would meet one another. \n \n === Structure === \n [[File:CasaMila-Balcons.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|CasaMila-Balcony, showing the self-supporting stone facade, also supported by curved iron beams]] \n Casa Mil\u00e0 is characterized by its self-supporting stone facade, meaning that it is free of load-bearing walls. The facade connects to the internal structure of each floor by means of curved iron beams surrounding the perimeter of each floor. This construction system allows, on one hand, large openings in the facade which give light to the homes, and on the other, free structuring of the different levels, so that internal walls can be added and demolished without affecting the stability of the building. This allows the owners to change their minds at will and to modify, without problems, the interior layout of the homes. < ref name=any2002a > [http://www.bcn.es/gaudi2002/catalan/obras/10com.htm Descripci\u00f3 casa Mil\u00e0] a \u00abany Gaud\u00ed\u00bb a l'Ajuntament de Barcelona < /ref > \n \n === Constructive and decorative items === \n ==== Facade ==== \n The facade is composed of large blocks of [[limestone]] from the [[Garraf Massif]] on the first floor and from the [[Villefranche-de-Conflent|Villefranche]] quarry for the higher levels. The blocks were cut to follow the plot of the projection of the model, then raised to their location and adjusted to align in a continuous curve to the pieces around them. \n \n Viewed from the outside the building has three parts: the main body of the six-storey blocks with winding stone floors, two floors set a block back with a different curve, similar to waves,  a smoother texture and whiter color, and with small holes that look like [[embrasure]]s, and finally the body of the roof. < ref name=permanyer > [[#permanyer|Permanyer, 1996....p\u00e0g. 150-166]] < /ref > \n \n Gaud\u00ed's original facade had some of its lower-level ironwork removed. In 1928, the tailor Mosella opened the first store in La Pedrera, and he eliminated the bars. This did not concern anyone, because in the middle of twentieth century, wrought ironwork had little importance. The ironwork was lost until a few years later, when Americans donated one of them to the [[Museum of Modern Art in New York|MoMa]], where it is on display. \n \n With restoration initiatives launched in 1987, the facade was rejoined to some pieces of stone that had fallen. In order to respect the fidelity of the original, material was obtained from the Villefranche quarry, even though by then it was no longer operating. < ref Name=huertas/ > \n \n ==== Hall and courtyards ==== \n The building uses a completely original solution to solve the issue of a lobby being too closed and dark. Its open and airy courtyards provide a place of transit and are directly visible to those accessing the building. There are two patios on the side of the Passeig de Gracia and of the street Provence. \n \n ;Patios \n [[File:Staircase - Patio of Casa Mil\u00e0 - Barcelona 2014.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The patio]] \n Patios, structurally, are key as supporting loads of interior facades. The floor of the courtyard is supported by pillars of [[cast iron]]. In the courtyard, there are traditional elliptical beams and girders but Gaud\u00ed applied an ingenious solution of using two concentric cylindrical beams with stretched radial beams, like the spokes of a bicycle. They form a point outside of the beam to two points above and below, making the function of the central girder a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] and working in tension and compression simultaneously. This supported structure is twelve feet in diameter and is considered  \" the soul of the building \"  with a clear resemblance to Gothic crypts. The centerpiece was built in a shipyard by [[Josep Maria Carandell]] who copied a steering wheel, interpreting Gaud\u00ed's intent as to represent the helm of the ship of life. \n \n ;Interior, gates \n [[File:Front gate - Casa Mil\u00e0 - Barcelona 2014.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Paintings cover the walls, with access protected by a giant iron gate]] \n Access is protected by a massive [[iron]] gate with a design attributed to Jujol. It was originally used by both people and cars, as access to the garage is in the basement, now an [[auditorium]]. \n \n The two halls are fully polychrome with oil [[Mural paintings in the lobby of the Casa Mila|paintings]] on the plaster surfaces, with [[eclecticism|eclectic]] references to [[mythology]] and flowers. \n \n During construction there was a problem including a basement as a garage for cars, the new invention that was thrilling the bourgeois at the time. The future neighbor Felix Anthony Meadows, owner of Industrial Linera, requested a change because his [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls Royce]] could not access it. Gaud\u00ed agreed to remove a pillar on the ramp that led into the garage so that Felix, who was establishing sales and factory in [[Walls of Valles]], could go to both places with his car from La Pedrera. < ref Name=huertas/ > \n \n For the floors of Casa Mil\u00e0, Gaud\u00ed used a model of [[floor]] forms of square timbers with two colors, and the [[hydraulic pavement]] hexagonal pieces of blue and sea motifs that had originally been designed for the Batllo house. The wax was designed in gray by John Bertrand under the supervision of Gaud\u00ed who  \" touched up with their own fingers, \"  in the words of the manufacturer [[Josep Bay]]. < ref name=bayo20 > [[#bayo|Bassegoda, 2003....p\u00e0g. 20]] < /ref > \n \n ==== Loft ==== \n [[File:Attic of Casa Mil\u00e0.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The attic]] \n Like in [[Casa Batll\u00f3]], Gaud\u00ed shows the application of the [[catenary arch]] as a support structure for the roof, a form which he had already used shortly after graduating in the wood frameworks of [[Matar\u00f3]]'s cooperative known as  \" L'Obrera Mataronense. \"  In this case, Gaud\u00ed used the Catalan technique of [[Catalan vault|timbrel]], imported from [[Italy]] in the fourteenth century. \n \n The attic, where the laundry rooms were located, was a clear room under a [[Catalan vault]] roof supported by 270 [[parabolic vault]]s of different heights and spaced by about 80 & nbsp;cm. The roof resembles both the ribs of a huge animal and a palm, giving the roof-deck a very unconventional shape similar to a landscape of hills and valleys. The shape and location of the courtyards makes the arches higher when the space is narrowed and lower when the space expands. \n \n The builder Bay\u00f3 explained its construction:  \" First the face of a wide wall was filled with mortar and plastered. Then [[Josep Canaleta i Cuadras|Canaleta]] indicated the opening of each arch and Bay\u00f3 put a nail at each starting point of the arch at the top of the wall. From these nails was dangled a chain so that the lowest point coincided with the deflection of the arch. Then the profile displayed on the wall by the chain was drawn and on this profile the carpenter marked and placed the corresponding centering, and the timbrel vault was started with three rows of plane bricks. Gaud\u00ed wanted to add a longitudinal axis of bricks connecting all vaults at their keystones \" . \n \n ==== Roof and chimneys ==== \n [[File:Barcelona Part Deux - 42 (3466892400).jpg|thumb|left|240px|''Casa Mil\u00e0'' roof architecture, chimneys known as ''espanta bruixes'' ([[witch]] scarers) < ref > {{cite book| author = Fodor's| title = Fodor's Barcelona, 2nd Edition| url = https://books.google.com/?id=GEvmlfNtqFoC & pg=PA85| date = 2008-03-04| publisher = Fodor's Travel Publications| page = 85 }} < /ref > ]] \n The work of Gaud\u00ed on the rooftop of La Pedrera brought his experience at [[Palau G\u00fcell]] together with solutions that were clearly more innovative & nbsp;\u2013 this time creating shapes and volumes with more body, more prominence, and less polychromasia. < ref name= \" Permanyer, either 1996 or 2008 \" > https://www.permanyer.com/345438/{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > \n \n On the rooftop there are six skylights/staircase exits (four of which were covered with broken pottery and some that ended in a double cross typical of Gaud\u00ed), twenty-eight chimneys in several groupings, two half-hidden vents whose function is to renew the air in the building, and four domes that discharged to the facade. The staircases also house the water tanks; some of which are snail-shaped. \n \n The stepped roof of La Pedrera, called  \" the garden of warriors \"  by the poet [[Pere Gimferrer]] because the chimneys appear to be protecting the skylights, has undergone a radical restoration, removing chimneys added in interventions after Gaud\u00ed, television antennas, and other elements that degraded the space. The restoration brought back the splendor to the chimneys and the skylights that were covered with fragments of [[marble]] and broken [[tile Valencia|Valencia tiles]]. One of the chimneys was topped with glass pieces & nbsp;\u2013 it was said that Gaud\u00ed did that the day after the inauguration of the building, taking advantage of the empty bottles from the party. It was restored with the bases of champagne bottles from the early twentieth century. The repair work has enabled the restoration of the original impact of the overhangs made of stone from [[Ulldecona]] with fragments of tiles.

This was part of the concept artwork itself integral to [[modernism]] in which the architect assumed responsibility for global issues such as the structure and the facade, as well as every detail of the decor, designing furniture and accessories such as lamps, planters, floors or ceilings. \n \n This was another point of friction with Segimon, who complained that there was no straight wall to place her Steinway piano. < ref name = orchards > {{cite book | title=La Pedrera: arquitectura i hist\u00f2ria | publisher=Caixa de Catalunya | author=Flores, Carlos | year=1999 | pages=187\u2013224 | isbn=978-84-87135-35-4}} < /ref >  Gaud\u00ed's response was blunt:  \" So play the violin. \" < ref name=patrimoni/ >  The result of these disagreements has been the loss of the decorative legacy of Gaud\u00ed, as most of the furniture was removed due to climate change and the changes she made to the main floor when Gaud\u00ed died. Some remain in private collections, including a curtain made of [[oak]] 4 m. long by 1.96 m. high in the Museum of Catalan Modernism; and a chair and desktop of Mil\u00e0.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} \n \n Gaud\u00ed carved oak doors similar to what he had done for the Casa y Bardes, but these were only included on two floors as when Segimon discovered the price, she decided there would be no more at that quality. < ref name=bayo20/ > \n \n == Architecture == \n [[File:Catalunya en Miniatura-La Pedrera.JPG|thumb|Scale model at the [[Catalunya en Miniatura]] park]] \n ''Casa Mil\u00e0'' is part of the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]  \" Works of [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]] \" . It was a predecessor of some buildings with a similar [[biomorphism|biomorphic]] appearance: \n * the 1921 [[Einstein Tower]] in [[Potsdam]], designed by [[Erich Mendelsohn]] \n * [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] \n * [[Chapelle Notre Dame du Haut]], [[Ronchamp]], [[France]], designed by [[Le Corbusier]] \n * the [[Hundertwasserhaus]] and other works by Austrian architect [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]] \n * [[Disney Concert Hall]] in [[Los Angeles]], by [[Frank Gehry]] \n \n Free exhibitions often are held on the first floor, which also provides some opportunity to see the interior design. There is a charge for entrance to the apartment on the fourth floor and the roof. The other floors are not open to visitors. \n \n === Constructive similarities === \n Gaud\u00ed's La Pedrera was inspired by a mountain, but there is no agreement as to which mountain was the reference model. Joan Berg\u00f3s thought it was the rocks of Fray Guerau in [[Prades mountains]]. Joan Matamala thought that the model could have been St. Miquel del Fai, while the sculptor Vicente Vilarubias believed it was inspired by the cliffs Torrent Pareis in [[Menorca]]. Other options include the mountains of [[U\u00e7hisar]] in [[Cappadocia]], suggested by Juan Goytisolo, or Mola Gallifa, suggested by Louis Permanyer, based on the fact that Gaud\u00ed visited the area in 1885 to escape an outbreak of cholera in [[Barcelona]]. < ref name=permanyer/ > \n \n Some people say that the interior layout of La Pedrera comes from studies that Gaud\u00ed made of medieval fortresses. This image is reinforced by the seeming appearance of the rooftop chimneys as  \" sentinels \"  with great helmets. < ref Name=ruta/ >  The structure of the iron door in the lobby does not follow any symmetry, straight or repetitive pattern. Rather, it evokes bubbles of [[soap]] that are formed between the hands or the structures of a plant cell. < ref name=cirici > [[Alexandre Cirici i Pellicer|CIRICI A.]] ''Barcelona pam a pam''. Barcelona 1971 (7th ed. 1985) Ed. Teide {{ISBN|84-307-8187-0}} < /ref > \n \n == Criticism and controversy == \n [[File:Casa Mil\u00e0 am Abend.jpg|thumb|Casa Mil\u00e0 at night]] \n The building's unconventional style made it the subject of much criticism. It was given the nickname  \" La Pedrera \" , meaning  \" the quarry \" . < ref Name=huertas/ >  Casa Mil\u00e0 appeared in many satirical magazines. [[Joan Junceda]] presented it as a traditional  \" Easter cake \"  by means of cartoons in ''[[Patufet]]''. Joaquim Garcia made a joke about the difficulty of setting the damask wrought iron balconies in his magazine. < ref Name=huertas/ >  Homeowners in [[Passeig de Gracia]] became angry with Mil\u00e0 and ceased to greet him, arguing that the weird building by Gaud\u00ed would lower the price of land in the area. \n \n ===Administrative problems=== \n Casa Mil\u00e0 also caused some administrative problems. In December 1907 the [[City Council|City Hall]] stopped work on the building because of a pillar which occupied part of the sidewalk, not respecting the alignment of facades. Again on August 17, 1908, more problems occurred when the building surpassed the predicted height and borders of its construction site by {{convert|4000|m2|ft2}}. The Council called for a fine of 100,000 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] (approximately 25% of the cost of work) or for the demolition of the attic and roof. The dispute was resolved a year and a half later, December 28, 1909, when the Commission certified that it was a monumental building and thus not required to have a 'strict compliance' with the bylaws. < ref name=cronologia/ > \n \n {{Anchor|Contests}} \n \n ===Design competitions=== \n The owner entered La Pedrera in the annual {{illm|Barcelona Artistic Buildings Competition|ca|Concurs anual d'edificis art\u00edstics|es|Concurso anual de edificios art\u00edsticos (Barcelona)}} sponsored by the Barcelona City Council (''[[Ayuntamiento (Spain)|Ayuntament]]'').

There were many disagreements between them, one example was the monumental bronze virgin del Rosario, which Gaud\u00ed wanted as the statue on the front of the building in homage to the name of the owner, that the artist Carles Mani i Roig was to sculpt. The statue was not made although the words  \" ''Ave gratia M plena Dominus tecum'' \"  were written at the top of the facade. Continuing disagreements led Gaud\u00ed to take Mil\u00e0 to court over his fees. The lawsuit was won by Gaud\u00ed in 1916, and he gave the 105,000 pesetas he won in the case to charity, stating that  \" the principles mattered more than money. \"  Mil\u00e0 was having to pay the mortgage. < ref Name=huertas/ > \n \n After Gaud\u00ed's death in 1926, Segimon got rid of most of the furniture that Gaud\u00ed had designed and covered over parts of Gaud\u00ed's designs with new decorations in the style of [[Louis XVI]]. La Pedrera was acquired in 1986 by {{ill|Caixa Catalunya|ca||es}} and when restoration was done four years later, some of the original decorations re-emerged. < ref Name=permanyer/ > \n \n When the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] broke out in July 1936, the Mil\u00e0s were on vacation. Part of the building was collectivized by the [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia]]; the Mil\u00e0s fled the area with some artwork. < ref Name=huertas/ > \n \n == In media and literature == \n * A scene in ''[[The Passenger (1975 film)|The Passenger]]'' (Italian: ''[[Professione: reporter]]''), a film directed by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and starring [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]], was filmed on the roof of the building. \n * A scene filmed on the roof in [[Vicky Cristina Barcelona]], directed by [[Woody Allen]]. \n * Mentioned in the book by Eoin Colfer: [[Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony]] \n * Mentioned in the book by Trudi Alexy 'The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot' \n * Mentioned in the 'Ballrooms and Biscotti' episode (season 4, episode 1) of [[Gilmore Girls]] \n * Several scenes in the movie, ''[[Gaudi Afternoon]]'' \n * A scale model exhibited at the [[Catalunya en Miniatura]] park. \n * Featured in the music video for [[Deep Forest]]'s '[[Sweet Lullaby]]' \n * The home of Edmond Kirsch in [[Dan Brown]]'s novel ''[[Origin (Dan Brown novel)|Origin]]'', the 5th book featuring [[Robert Langdon]]. \n \n == Gallery == \n < gallery > \n File:Mil\u00e0 plano s\u00f3tano.jpg|Design in 1906 \n File:Barcelona Part Deux - 65 (3466899772).jpg|Ironwork on the main gate \n File:LaPedreraParabola.jpg|[[Catenary]] [[arch]]es under the terrace of ''Casa Mil\u00e0'' \n File:Casa mila atrium.jpg|''Casa Mil\u00e0'' atrium at dusk, after restoration \n File:Casa Mila Rooftop.jpg|''Casa Mil\u00e0'' rooftop in Spring \n File:Catenary arch - Roof of Casa Mil\u00e0 - Barcelona 2014 (2).jpg|Arch on the roof \n File:Casa Mil\u00e0 01.jpg|Ventilation towers \n File:Casa Mil\u00e0 (Barcelona) - 9.jpg|Glass towers on the roof \n File:La Pedrera Staircase (5837381385).jpg|Staircase \n File:Barcelona Part Deux - 63 (3466899120).jpg|Paintings on the ceiling \n File:CaMil\u00e125062006(005).JPG|Detail of an original balcony \n File:Casa Mil\u00e0 (Antoni Gaudi) (atrium), 92, Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia.
