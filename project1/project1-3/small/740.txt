He accused his mother of being financially irresponsible, flirtatious and seeking to remarry, which he considered an insult to his father's memory. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 116 < /ref > < ref name= \" autogenerated131 \" / >  His mother, while professing her love to him, criticized him sharply for being moody, tactless, and argumentative, and urged him to improve his behavior so that he would not alienate people. < ref name= \" autogenerated129 \" / >  Arthur concentrated on his studies, which were now going very well, and he also enjoyed the usual social life such as balls, parties and theater. By that time Johanna's famous salon was well established among local intellectuals and dignitaries, the most celebrated of them being [[Goethe]]. Arthur attended her parties, usually when he knew that Goethe would be there{{mdash}}although the famous writer and statesman seemed not even to notice the young and unknown student. It is possible that Goethe kept a distance because Johanna warned him about her son's depressive and combative nature, or because Goethe was then on bad terms with Arthur's language instructor and roommate, [[Franz Passow]]. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 134 < /ref >  Schopenhauer was also captivated by the beautiful [[Karoline Jagemann]], mistress of [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]], and he wrote to her his only known love poem. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 135 < /ref >  Despite his later celebration of asceticism and negative views of sexuality, Schopenhauer occasionally had sexual affairs{{mdash}}usually with women of lower social status, such as servants, actresses, and sometimes even paid prostitutes. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 21 < /ref >  In a letter to his friend Anthime he claims that such affairs continued even in his mature age and admits that he had two out-of-wedlock daughters (born in 1819 and 1836), both of whom died in infancy. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 25 < /ref >  In their youthful correspondence Arthur and Anthime were somewhat boastful and competitive about their sexual exploits\u2014but Schopenhauer seemed aware that women usually didn't find him very charming or physically attractive, and his desires often remained unfulfilled. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 22 < /ref > \n \n He left Weimar to become a student at the [[Georg August University of G\u00f6ttingen|University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in 1809. There are no written reasons about why Schopenhauer chose that university instead of the then more famous [[University of Jena]], but G\u00f6ttingen was known as more modern and scientifically oriented, with less attention given to theology. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 140 < /ref >  Law or medicine were usual choices for young men of Schopenhauer's status who also needed career and income; he chose [[medicine]] due to his [[Natural science|scientific interests]]. Among his notable professors were [[Bernhard Friedrich Thibaut]], [[Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren]], [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]], [[Friedrich Stromeyer]], [[Heinrich Adolf Schrader]], [[Johann Tobias Mayer]] and [[Konrad Johann Martin Langenbeck]]. < ref > Cartwright (2010). pp. 141\u2013144 < /ref >  He studied [[metaphysics]], [[psychology]] and [[logic]] under [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]], the author of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]'', who made a strong impression and advised him to concentrate on [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 144 < /ref >  He decided to switch from medicine to philosophy around 1810\u201311 and he left G\u00f6ttingen, which did not have a strong philosophy program:  besides Schulze, the only other philosophy professor was [[Friedrich Bouterwek]], whom Schopenhauer disliked. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 150 < /ref >  He did not regret his medicinal and scientific studies;  he claimed that they were necessary for a philosopher, and even in Berlin he attended more lectures in sciences than in philosophy. < ref name= \" autogenerated170 \" > Cartwright (2010). p. 170 < /ref >  During his days at G\u00f6ttingen, he spent considerable time studying, but also continued his flute playing and social life. His friends included [[Friedrich Gotthilf Osann]], [[Karl Witte]], [[Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen]], and [[William Backhouse Astor Sr.]] < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 151 < /ref > \n \n He arrived at the newly founded [[University of Berlin]] for the winter semester of 1811\u201312.  At the same time, his mother had just begun her literary career; she published her first book in 1810, a biography of her friend [[Karl Ludwig Fernow]], which was a critical success. Arthur attended lectures by the prominent [[post-Kantian]] philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], but quickly found many points of disagreement with his ''Wissenschaftslehre'';  he also found Fichte's lectures tedious and hard to understand. < ref name= \" autogenerated159 \" > Cartwright (2010). p. 159 < /ref >  He later mentioned Fichte only in critical, negative terms < ref name= \" autogenerated159 \" / > {{mdash}}seeing his philosophy as a lower quality version of Kant's and considering it useful only because Fichte's poor arguments unintentionally highlighted some failings of Kantianism. < ref > Cartwright (2010). pp. 165\u2013169 < /ref >  He also attended the lectures of the famous Protestant theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], whom he also quickly came to dislike. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 174 < /ref >  His notes and comments on Schleiermacher's lectures show that Schopenhauer was becoming very [[Criticism of religion|critical of religion]] and moving towards [[atheism]]. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 175 < /ref >  He learned by self-directed reading; besides Plato, Kant and Fichte he also read the works of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Jakob Friedrich Fries|Fries]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[John Locke|Locke]], and much current scientific literature. < ref name= \" autogenerated170 \" / >  He attended philological courses by [[August B\u00f6ckh]] and [[Friedrich August Wolf]] and continued his naturalistic interests with courses by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], [[Paul Erman]], [[Johann Elert Bode]], [[Ernst Gottfried Fischer]], [[Johann Horkel]], [[Friedrich Christian Rosenthal]] and [[Hinrich Lichtenstein]] (Lichtenstein was also a friend whom he met at one of his mother's parties in Weimar). < ref > Cartwright (2010). pp. 171\u2013174 < /ref > \n \n === Early work === \n Schopenhauer left Berlin in a rush in 1813, fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as Prussia had just joined the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|war against France]]. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 179 < /ref >  He returned to Weimar, but left after less than a month disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover, Georg Friedrich Konrad Ludwig M\u00fcller von Gerstenbergk (1778\u20131838), a civil servant twelve years younger than her; he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his father's memory. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 188 < /ref >  He settled for a while in [[Rudolstadt]], hoping that no army would pass through the small town.  He spent his time in solitude, [[hiking]] in the mountains and the [[Thuringian forest]] and writing his dissertation, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''. He completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]. He became irritated by the arrival of soldiers in the town and accepted his mother's invitation to visit her in Weimar. She tried to convince him that her relationship with Gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intention of remarrying. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 230 < /ref >  But Schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented, pretentious, and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]]. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 231 < /ref >  His mother had just published her second book, ''Reminiscences of a Journey in the Years 1803, 1804, and 1805'', a description of their family tour of Europe, which quickly became a hit. She found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper Arthur told her that people would read his work long after the  \" rubbish \"  she wrote was totally forgotten. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/Schopenhauer.html |title=Schopenhauer: A Pessimist in the Optimistic Month of May |publisher=Germanic American Institute |access-date=12 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611051923/http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/schopenhauer.html |archive-date=11 June 2010  }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/selectedessaysof033377mbp/selectedessaysof033377mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of  \" Selected Essays Of Schopenhauer \"  |access-date=12 March 2010}} < /ref >  In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the [[F.A.

In 1836, he published ''On the Will in Nature''. In 1836 he sent his essay  \" [[On the Freedom of the Will]] \"  to the contest of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and won the prize for the following year.  He sent another essay,  \" [[On the Basis of Morality]] \" , to the Royal Danish Society for Scientific Studies, but did not win the prize despite being the only contestant.  The Society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a very offensive manner, and claimed that the essay missed the point of the set topic and that the arguments were inadequate. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 483 < /ref >  Schopenhauer, who had been very confident that he would win, was enraged by this rejection. He published both essays as ''The Two Basic Problems of Ethics''.  The first edition, published in 1841, again failed to draw attention to his philosophy. In the preface to the second edition, in 1860, he was still pouring insults on the Royal Danish Society. < ref > Cartwright (2010). p. 484 < /ref >   Two years later, after some negotiations, he managed to convince his publisher, Brockhaus, to print the second, updated edition of ''The World as Will and Representation''.  That book was again mostly ignored and the few reviews were mixed or negative.  \n   \n However, Schopenhauer did start to attract some followers, mostly outside academia, among practical professionals (several of them were lawyers) who pursued private philosophical studies.

Allen  &  Unwin. < /ref > \n \n == Philosophy == \n \n === The world as representation === \n Schopenhauer saw his philosophy as a continuation of Kant's, and used the results of Kantian epistemological investigation ([[transcendental idealism]]) as starting point for his own. Kant had argued that the [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our [[mental representation]]s. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|at=\u00a7 52c|translator-last=Paul Carus}} < /ref >  Schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work:  \" The world is my representation (''Die Welt ist meine Vorstellung'') \" . Everything that there is for cognition (the entire world) exists simply as an object in relation to a subject{{mdash}}a 'representation' to a subject. Everything that belongs to the world is, therefore, 'subject-dependent'. In Book One of ''The World as Will and Representation,'' Schopenhauer considers the world from this angle{{mdash}}that is, insofar as it is representation. \n \n === Theory of perception === \n In November 1813 [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] invited Schopenhauer to help him on his [[Theory of Colours]]. Although Schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter, < ref > Letter to Goethe on 23 January 1816:   \" Ich wei\u00df, da\u00df durch mich die Wahrheit geredet hat, \u2013 in dieser kleinen Sache, wie dereinst in gr\u00f6\u00dfern. \" < /ref >  he accepted the invitation out of admiration for Goethe. Nevertheless, these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology: finding a demonstration for the ''a priori'' nature of causality. \n \n Kant openly admitted that it was [[David Hume|Hume]]'s skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and gave an elaborate proof to show that causality is ''a priori''. After [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze|G. E. Schulze]] had made it plausible that Kant had not disproven Hume's skepticism, it was up to those loyal to Kant's project to prove this important matter. \n \n The difference between the approaches of Kant and Schopenhauer was this: Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is  \" given \"  to us from outside, an expression with which Schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction. < ref > {{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|volume=Vol 1. Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy|quote=But the whole teaching of Kant contains really nothing more about this than the oft-repeated meaningless expression: 'The empirical element in perception is given from without.' ... always through the same meaningless metaphorical expression: 'The empirical perception is given us.'}} < /ref >  He, on the other hand, was occupied with the questions: how do we get this empirical content of perception; how is it possible to comprehend subjective sensations  \" limited to my skin \"  as the objective perception of things that lie  \" outside \"  of me? < ref > {{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=\u00a7 21|quote=For sensation is and remains a process within the organism and is limited, as such, to the region within the skin; it cannot therefore contain any thing which lies beyond that region, or, in other words, anything that is outside us. ... It is only when the Understanding begins to apply its sole form, the causal law, that a powerful transformation takes place, by which subjective sensation becomes objective perception.}} < /ref > \n \n {{Quotation|The sensations in the hand of a man born blind, on feeling an object of cubic shape, are quite uniform and the same on all sides and in every direction: the edges, it is true, press upon a smaller portion of his hand, still nothing at all like a cube is contained in these sensations. His Understanding, however, draws the immediate and intuitive conclusion from the resistance felt, that this resistance must have a cause, which then presents itself through that conclusion as a hard body; and through the movements of his arms in feeling the object, while the hand's sensation remains unaltered, he constructs the cubic shape in Space. If the representation of a cause and of Space, together with their laws, had not already existed within him, the image of a cube could never have proceeded from those successive sensations in his hand. < ref > {{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=\u00a7 21}} < /ref > |sign=|source=}} \n \n Causality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions, as Hume had maintained;  instead, as Kant had said, objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality. < ref > {{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|volume=Vol. 1, \u00a7 4.|quote=The contrary doctrine that the law of causality results from experience, which was the scepticism of Hume, is first refuted by this. For the independence of the knowledge of causality of all experience,\u2014that is, its a priori character\u2014can only be deduced from the dependence of all experience upon it; and this deduction can only be accomplished by proving, in the manner here indicated, and explained in the passages referred to above, that the knowledge of causality is included in perception in general, to which all experience belongs, and therefore in respect of experience is completely a priori, does not presuppose it, but is presupposed by it as a condition.}} < /ref > \n \n By this intellectual operation, comprehending every effect in our sensory organs as having an external cause, the external world arises. With vision, finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines. We are seldom conscious of the process that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object, that inverts the impressions on the retinas, and that uses the change in the apparent position of an object relative to more distant objects provided by binocular vision to perceive depth and distance. \n \n Schopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception; the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation. He set out his theory of perception for the first time in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'', < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >  and, in the subsequent editions of ''Fourfold Root'', an extensive exposition is given in \u00a7 21. \n \n === The world as will === \n {{main|The World as Will and Representation}} \n \n In Book Two of ''The World as Will and Representation,'' Schopenhauer considers what the world is beyond the aspect of it that appears to us{{mdash}}that is, the aspect of the world beyond representation, the world considered  \" [[thing-in-itself|in-itself]] \"  or  \" [[noumena]] \" , its inner essence. The very being in-itself of all things, Schopenhauer argues, is will (''Wille''). The empirical world that appears to us as representation has plurality and is ordered in a spatio-temporal framework. The world as thing in-itself must exist outside the subjective forms of space and time. Although the world manifests itself to our experience as a multiplicity of objects (the  \" objectivation \"  of the will), each element of this multiplicity has the same blind essence striving towards existence and life. Human rationality is merely a secondary phenomenon that does not distinguish humanity from the rest of nature at the fundamental, essential level. The advanced cognitive abilities of human beings, Schopenhauer argues, serve the ends of willing{{mdash}}an illogical, directionless, ceaseless striving that condemns the human individual to a life of suffering unredeemed by any final purpose. Schopenhauer's philosophy of the will as the essential reality behind the world as representation is often called [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|metaphysical voluntarism]].{{citation needed|date=April 2021}} \n \n For Schopenhauer, understanding the world as will leads to ethical concerns (see the [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Ethics|ethics section below]] for further detail), which he explores in the Fourth Book of ''The World as Will and Representation'' and again in his two prize essays on ethics, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'' and ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]''. No individual human actions are free, Schopenhauer argues, because they are events in the world of appearance and thus are subject to the principle of sufficient reason: a person's actions are a necessary consequence of motives and the given character of the individual human. Necessity extends to the actions of human beings just as it does to every other appearance, and thus we cannot speak of freedom of individual willing. Albert Einstein quoted the Schopenhauerian idea that  \" a man can ''do'' as he will, but not ''will'' as he will. \" < ref > Einstein, Albert (1935). ''The World as I See It'', p. 14. Snowball Publishing. {{ISBN|1494877066}}. < /ref >  Yet the will as thing in-itself is free, as it exists beyond the realm of representation and thus is not constrained by any of the forms of necessity that are part of the principle of sufficient reason. \n \n According to Schopenhauer, salvation from our miserable existence can come through the will's being 'tranquillized' by the metaphysical insight that reveals individuality to be merely an illusion. The saint or 'great soul' intuitively  \" recognizes the whole, comprehends its essence, and finds that it is constantly passing away, caught up in vain strivings, inner conflict, and perpetual suffering \" . < ref > ''The World as Will and Representation, Vol. 1'', \u00a768 < /ref >  The negation of the will, in other words, stems from the insight that the world in-itself (free from the forms of space and time) is one. [[Asceticism|Ascetic]] practices, Schopenhauer remarks, are used to aid the will's 'self-abolition', which brings about a blissful, redemptive 'will-less' state of emptiness that is free from striving or suffering. \n \n === Art and aesthetics === \n {{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}} \n [[File:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|In his main work, Schopenhauer praised the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age artists]], who  \" directed such purely objective perception to the most insignificant objects, and set up a lasting monument of their objectivity and spiritual peace in paintings of ''[[still life]].'' The aesthetic beholder does not contemplate this without emotion. \" < ref > ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 1, \u00a738 < /ref > ]] \n For Schopenhauer, human  \" willing \" \u2014desiring, craving, etc.\u2014is at the root of [[suffering]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation. Here one moves away from ordinary cognizance of individual things to cognizance of eternal Platonic ''Ideas''\u2014in other words, cognizance that is free from the service of will. In aesthetic contemplation, one no longer perceives an object of perception as something from which one is separated; rather  \" it is as if the object alone existed without anyone perceiving it, and one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception, but the two have become one, the entirety of consciousness entirely filled and occupied by a single perceptual image \" . < ref > ''The World as Will and Representation,'' Vol. 1, \u00a734 < /ref >  Subject and object are no longer distinguishable, and the ''Idea'' comes to the fore. \n \n From this aesthetic immersion, one is no longer an individual who suffers as a result of servitude to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a  \" pure, will-less, painless, timeless, subject of cognition \" . The pure, will-less subject of cognition is cognizant only of Ideas, not individual things: this is a kind of cognition that is unconcerned with relations between objects according to the Principle of Sufficient Reason (time, space, cause and effect) and instead involves complete absorption in the object. \n \n Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation, since it attempts to depict the essence/pure Ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, is the purest form of art because it is the one that depicts the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Reason, therefore as an individual object. According to [[Daniel Albright]],  \" Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself \" . < ref > Daniel Albright, ''Modernism and Music'', 2004, p. 39, footnote 34 < /ref >  He deemed music a timeless, universal language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody. < ref name=Music  > {{cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=10|isbn=978-0-14-044227-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162 162]|url=https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162}} < /ref > \n \n === Mathematics === \n Schopenhauer's [[Mathematical realism|realist]] views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of contemporaneous attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] in [[Euclidean geometry]]. Writing shortly before the discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]] demonstrated the logical independence of the [[axiom]]\u2014and long before the [[general theory of relativity]] revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space\u2014Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect [[concept]]s to prove what he held was directly evident from [[intuition|intuitive perception]]. \n \n {{quote|text=The Euclidean method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous controversy over the theory of ''parallels'', and in the attempts, repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom (also known as the fifth postulate). The axiom asserts, and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclined to each other (for this is the precise meaning of  \" less than two right angles \" ), if produced far enough, must meet. Now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore needs a proof; but no such proof can be produced, just because there is nothing more immediate. < ref name= \" ReferenceB \" > ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. 2, ch. 13 < /ref > }} \n \n Throughout his writings, < ref > \" I wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference, indeed opposition, between knowledge of perception and abstract or reflected knowledge. Hitherto this difference has received too little attention, and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy & nbsp;... \"  \u2013 ''The World as Will and Representation.'', vol. 2, ch. 7, p. 88 (trans. Payne) < /ref >  Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions. \n \n {{quote|text=In fact, it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity. But it is precisely through the controversies over this, together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the ''directly'' certain as merely ''indirectly'' certain, that the independence and clearness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof, a contrast as instructive as it is amusing. The direct certainty will not be admitted here, just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept, and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject, according to the principle of contradiction. But that eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines is a [[synthetic proposition]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and as such has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the [[principle of contradiction]] itself, from which all proofs originally derive their certainty. At bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem & nbsp;...}} \n \n Although Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms. < ref > This comment by Schopenhauer was called  \" an acute observation \"  by [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]]. In his translation of [[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]], vol. 1, Book I,  \" Note on Common Notion 4 \" , Heath made this judgment and also noted that Schopenhauer's remark  \" was a criticism in advance of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz']] theory \" . Helmholtz had  \" maintained that geometry requires us to assume the actual existence of rigid bodies and their free mobility in space \"  and is therefore  \" dependent on mechanics \" . < /ref > \n \n {{quote|text=It surprises me that the eighth axiom, < ref > What Schopenhauer calls the eighth axiom is Euclid's Common Notion 4. < /ref >   \" Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another \" , is not rather attacked. For '' \" coinciding with one another \" '' is either a mere [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], or something quite [[empirical]], belonging not to pure intuition or perception, but to external sensuous experience. Thus it presupposes mobility of the figures, but [[matter]] alone is movable in [[space]]. Consequently, this reference to coincidence with one another forsakes pure space, the sole element of [[geometry]], in order to pass over to the material and empirical. < ref name= \" ReferenceB \" / > }} \n This follows [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reasoning. < ref > \" Motion of an ''object'' in space does not belong in a pure science, and consequently not in geometry.

As such, he states that philosophy is always theoretical: its task to explain what is given. < ref > {{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 53.}} < /ref > \n \n According to Kant's transcendental idealism, space and time are forms of our sensibility in which phenomena appear in multiplicity. Reality [[thing-in-itself|in itself]] is free from multiplicity, not in the sense that an object is one, but that it is outside the ''possibility'' of multiplicity. Two individuals, though they appear distinct, are in-themselves not distinct. < ref > {{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 23.}} < /ref > \n \n Appearances are entirely subordinated to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. The egoistic individual who focuses his aims on his own interests has to deal with empirical laws as well as he can. \n \n What is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self-interest. If we take a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support ''their'' needs instead of his ''own'' pleasures, then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes ''less distinction between himself'' and others than is usually made. < ref > {{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 66.}} < /ref > \n \n Regarding how things ''appear'' to us, the egoist asserts a gap between two individuals, but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own. In the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals, though they appear as distinct from himself. \n \n What motivates the altruist is compassion. The suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent, but he feels connectiveness to all beings. Compassion is thus the basis of morality. < ref > {{Cite book|title=On the Basis of Morality|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=\u00a7 19}} < /ref > \n \n ==== Eternal justice ==== \n Schopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the ''[[principium individuationis]]''. When we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence. Individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of others\u2014the will, as the only thing that exists, has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure. This is a fundamental characteristic of the will, and cannot be circumvented. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Parerga and Paralipomena|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=Vol. 2, \u00a7 173}} < /ref > \n \n Unlike temporal or human justice, which requires time to repay an evil deed and  \" has its seat in the state, as requiting and punishing \" , < ref name= \" World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63 \" / >  eternal justice  \" rules not the state but the world, is not dependent upon human institutions, is not subject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, wavering, and erring, but infallible, fixed, and sure \" . < ref name= \" World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63 \" > ''The World as Will and Idea'' Vol. 1 \u00a7 63 < /ref >  Eternal justice is not retributive, because retribution requires time.

Schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by the Christian dogma of [[original sin]] and, in Eastern religions, by the [[Reincarnation|dogma of rebirth.]] \n \n ==== Quietism ==== \n He who sees through the ''principium individuationis'' and comprehends suffering ''in general'' as his own will see suffering everywhere and, instead of fighting for the happiness of his individual manifestation, will abhor life itself since he knows that it is inseparably connected with suffering. For him, a happy individual life in a world of suffering is like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king. < ref name= \" Ascetic \" > {{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 68.}} < /ref > \n \n Those who have experienced this intuitive knowledge cannot affirm life, but exhibit asceticism and quietism, meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives, are not concerned about their individual welfare, and accept without resistance the evil that others inflict on them.

Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state and state action to check the innate destructive tendencies of our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one). < ref > ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 47 < /ref > \n \n He declared that [[monarchy]] is  \" natural to man in almost the same way as it is to bees and ants, to cranes in flight, to wandering elephants, to wolves in a pack in search of prey, and to other animals \" . < ref name= \" Paralipomena, Vol p. 254 \" > ''Parerga and Paralipomena, Vol. 2'',  \" On Jurisprudence and Politics, \"  \u00a7127, trans.

In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he maintained his position of  \" minding not the times but the eternities \" .  He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is:  \" For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect. \" < ref > ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12 < /ref > \n \n ==== Punishment ==== \n The State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals to prevent future crimes.

All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization. < ref > ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Vol. 2,  \" On Philosophy and Natural Science, \"  \u00a792, trans.

Speaking of the treatment of slaves in the [[Slavery in the United States|slave-holding states of the United States]], he condemned  \" those devils in human form, those bigoted, church-going, strict sabbath-observing scoundrels, especially the Anglican parsons among them \"  for how they  \" treat their innocent black brothers who through violence and injustice have fallen into their devil's claws \" . The slave-holding states of North America, Schopenhauer writes, are a  \" disgrace to the whole of humanity \" . < ref > ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Vol. 2,  \" On Ethics, \"  \u00a7114, trans. Payne (p. 212). < /ref > \n \n In his ''Metaphysics of Sexual Love'', Schopenhauer wrote:  \n < blockquote >  Further, the consideration as to the complexion is very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the former. The reason is, that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the type, almost an abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at least to grey horses. In no part of the world, not even in the vicinity of the pole, are they indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandinavian origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the white colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by nature he has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the Hindus; that consequently a white man has never originally sprung from the womb of nature, and that thus there is no such thing as a white race, much as this is talked of, but every white man is a faded or bleached one. Forced into the strange world, where he only exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires in winter the hothouse, in the course of thousands of years man became white. The gipsies, an Indian race which immigrated only about four centuries ago, show the transition from the complexion of the Hindu to our own. Therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white colour of the skin has become a second nature, though not so that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more decidedly the more important the part is. < ref > http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Metaphysik_der_Geschlechtsliebe < /ref > < /blockquote > \n \n Schopenhauer also maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]. He argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual self-conquest. He saw this as opposed to the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly  \" Jewish \"  spirit: \n \n < blockquote > [Judaism] is, therefore, the crudest and poorest of all religions and consists merely in an absurd and revolting [[theism]]. It amounts to this that the [[Kyrios|''\u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2'' ['Lord']]], who has created the world, desires to be worshipped and adored; and so above all he is jealous, is envious of his colleagues, of all the other gods; if sacrifices are made to them he is furious and his Jews have a bad time ... It is most deplorable that this religion has become the basis of the prevailing religion of Europe; for it is a religion without any metaphysical tendency. While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations. < ref > \" Fragments for the History of Philosophy \" , ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I, trans.

He wrote that [[pederasty]] has the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated that  \" the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils \" . < ref > {{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}} < /ref > \n Schopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that  \" by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour.

He quotes [[Horace]]'s saying,  \" From the brave and good are the brave descended \"  (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''[[Cymbeline]]'',  \" Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base \"  (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument. < ref > Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519 < /ref > \n Mechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his intellect through his mother, and personal character through the father. < ref > ''On the Suffering of the World'' (1970), p. 35. Penguin Books \u2013 Great Ideas. < /ref >  This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love{{mdash}}placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the  \" final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation. ... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake. \"  This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote: \n \n < blockquote > With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could [[castrate]] all [[criminals|scoundrels]] and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole [[harem]], and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of [[Pericles]]. < ref > {{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = The World as Will and Representation |editor=E.

He was so impressed by its [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] that he called it  \" the production of the highest human wisdom \" , and believed it contained superhuman concepts. Schopenhauer considered [[India]] as  \" the land of the most ancient and most pristine wisdom, the place from which [[Europeans]] could trace their descent and the tradition by which they had been influenced in so many decisive ways \" ,{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=68}} and regarded the ''Upanishads'' as  \" the most profitable and elevating reading which [...] is possible in the world.

Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]]. Schopenhauer did not begin serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Safranski maintains that, between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]]. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and they developed a professional relationship.

Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puru\u1e63\u0101rtha]] or goals of life in [[Ved\u0101nta]] [[Hinduism]]. \n \n In Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by: \n * personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or \n * knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people. \n \n However, Buddhist [[nirv\u0101\u1e47a]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the  \" extinguishing \"  (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character. < ref > John J.

There is a remarkable correspondence in broad terms between some central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will. \"  (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''.

Schopenhauer maintained that Kant stands in the same relation to philosophers such as Berkeley and [[Plato]], as Copernicus to [[Hicetas]], [[Philolaus]], and [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]]: Kant succeeded in demonstrating what previous philosophers merely asserted. \n \n Schopenhauer writes about Kant's influence on his work in the preface to the second edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'': \n {{Quotation|I have already explained in the preface to the first edition, that my philosophy is founded on that of Kant, and therefore presupposes a thorough knowledge of it. I repeat this here. For Kant's teaching produces in the mind of everyone who has comprehended it a fundamental change which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth. It alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the original character of the intellect, which neither [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] nor [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] succeed in doing, for they remain too much in the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him, and which has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in another light. Only in this way can any one become susceptible to the more positive expositions which I have to give. On the other hand, he who has not mastered the Kantian philosophy, whatever else he may have studied, is, as it were, in a state of innocence; that is to say, he remains in the grasp of that natural and childish realism in which we are all born, and which fits us for everything possible, with the single exception of philosophy. < ref > {{Cite book|title=World as Will and Representation|last=Arthur Schopenhauer|volume=Vol. 1, Preface of the Second Edition}} < /ref > }} \n \n In his study room, one bust was of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the other was of Kant. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Schopenhauer.
