The [[flower]]s are [[catkin]]s with elongate male catkins on the same plant as shorter female catkins, often before leaves appear; they are mainly [[wind-pollinated]], but also visited by bees to a small extent. These trees differ from the [[birch]]es (''Betula'', another genus in the family) in that the female catkins are woody and do not disintegrate at maturity, opening to release the seeds in a similar manner to many [[conifer cone]]s. \n \n The largest species are [[red alder]] (''A. rubra'') on the west coast of North America, and [[Alnus glutinosa|black alder]] (''A. glutinosa''), [[native plant|native]] to most of Europe and widely introduced elsewhere, both reaching over 30 & nbsp;m (98.42 & nbsp;ft). By contrast, the widespread ''[[Alnus alnobetula]]'' (green alder) is rarely more than a {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=mid|-tall}} shrub. \n \n == Ecology == \n Alders are commonly found near streams, rivers, and wetlands. Sometimes where the prevalence of alders is particularly prominent these are called [[alder carr]]s.  In the Pacific Northwest of North America, the [[Alnus rhombifolia|white alder]] (''Alnus rhombifolia'') unlike other northwest alders, has an affinity for warm, dry climates, where it grows along watercourses, such as along the lower [[Columbia River]] east of the Cascades and the Snake River, including Hells Canyon. \n \n Alder leaves and sometimes catkins are used as food by numerous [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on alders|butterflies and moths]]. \n \n ''A. glutinosa'' and ''A. viridis'' are classed as environmental weeds in New Zealand. < ref > {{cite book|last=Clayson|first=Howell|title=Consolidated list of environmental weeds in New Zealand|publisher=Department of Conservation|location=Wellington|date=May 2008|isbn=978-0-478-14412-3}} < /ref >  Alder leaves and especially the roots are important to the ecosystem because they enrich the soil with nitrogen and other nutrients. \n \n === Nitrogen fixation === \n \n Alder is particularly noted for its important [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with ''[[Frankia alni]]'', an [[actinomycete]], [[Filamentation|filamentous]], nitrogen-fixing [[bacteria|bacterium]]. This bacterium is found in [[root nodule]]s, which may be as large as a human fist, with many small lobes, and light brown in colour. The bacterium absorbs [[nitrogen]] from the air and makes it available to the tree. Alder, in turn, provides the bacterium with [[sugar]]s, which it produces through [[photosynthesis]]. As a result of this mutually beneficial relationship, alder improves the [[Fertility (soil)|fertility of the soil]] where it grows, and as a [[pioneer species]], it helps provide additional nitrogen for the [[Ecological succession|successional]] species which follow. \n \n [[Image:Alnus_rubra_seeds.jpg|right|thumb|A red alder seed is a tiny [[samara (fruit)|samara]] like those of all alders]] \n Because of its abundance, red alder delivers large amounts of nitrogen to enrich forest soils. Red alder stands have been found to supply between {{convert|130|to|320|kg/ha|lb/acre|abbr=off}} of nitrogen annually to the soil. From Alaska to Oregon, ''Alnus viridis'' subsp. ''sinuata'' (''A. sinuata'', Sitka Alder or Slide Alder), characteristically pioneer fresh, gravelly sites at the foot of retreating glaciers. Studies show that Sitka alder, a more shrubby variety of alder, adds nitrogen to the soil at an average rate of {{convert|60|kg/ha|lb/acre|abbr=on}} per year, helping convert the sterile glacial terrain to soil capable of supporting a conifer forest. Alders are common among the first species to colonize disturbed areas from floods, windstorms, fires, landslides, etc. Alder groves themselves often serve as natural firebreaks since these broad-leaved trees are much less flammable than conifers. Their foliage and leaf litter does not carry a fire well, and their thin bark is sufficiently resistant to protect them from light surface fires. In addition, the light weight of alder seeds \u2013 {{convert|1.5|e6/kg|/lb|abbr=off|disp=or}} \u2013 allows for easy dispersal by the wind.  Although it outgrows coastal Douglas-fir for the first 25 years, it is very shade intolerant and seldom lives more than 100 years. Red alder is the Pacific Northwest's largest alder and the most plentiful and commercially important broad-leaved tree in the coastal Northwest.  Groves of red alder {{convert|25|to|50|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} in diameter intermingle with young Douglas-fir forests west of the Cascades, attaining a maximum height of {{convert|30|to|33|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} in about sixty years and then lose vigor as heart rot sets in. Alders largely help create conditions favorable for giant conifers that replace them. < ref > {{Cite book|title = Northwest Trees: Identifying and Understanding the Region's Native Trees|last1 = Arno|first1 = Stephen|publisher = The Mountaineers Books|year = 2007|isbn = 978-1-59485-041-7|location = Seattle, WA|pages = 165\u201369|last2 = Hammerly|first2 = Ramona}} < /ref > \n \n < gallery caption= \" Alder root nodules \"  widths= \" 250px \"  mode=packed > \n An alder root nodule gall.JPG|alt=An alder root nodule|Whole root nodule \n A sectioned alder root nodule gall.JPG|alt=A sectioned alder root nodule|Sectioned root nodules \n < /gallery > \n \n === Parasites === \n Alder roots are parasitized by [[Boschniakia rossica|northern groundcone]]. \n \n == Uses == \n [[File:Wappen at grossarl.png|thumb|right|Alder coat of arms of [[Grossarl]], [[Austria]]]] \n \n The [[catkin]]s of some alder species have a degree of edibility, < ref name= \" Edible Alder Catkins \" > {{cite web|url=http://www.pfaf.org/user/DatabaseSearhResult.aspx|title=Plant Search Result, see e.g. Alnus rubra|website=www.pfaf.org |access-date=17 November 2020}} < /ref >  and may be rich in protein.
