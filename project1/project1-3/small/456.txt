It is one of the defining books in the early formative years of modern baseball. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Spalding |first1=Albert G. |title=America's National Game.  |date=1911 |publisher=American sports Publishing Company |location=New York |edition=1| url = https://www.worldcat.org/title/americas-national-game/oclc/849521699?referer=br & ht=edition|OCLC=849521699}} < /ref > \n \n Much of the story is told first-hand; since the 1850s, Spalding had been involved in the game, first as a pitcher and later a manager and club owner. Later he branched out to become a leading manufacturer of sporting goods. \n \n In addition to his personal recollections, he had access to the records of [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]], the game's first [[baseball statistics|statistician]] and archivist. Much of his early history of the game is considered to be reliable. Spalding was, however, said to aggrandize his role in the major moments in baseball's history. Early editions of the book include quality full-page photo-plates of important players. \n \n ==See also== \n *[[History of baseball]] \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist}} \n {{Authority control}} \n [[Category:1911 non-fiction books]] \n [[Category:Baseball books]] \n \n \n {{sport-book-stub}}"
