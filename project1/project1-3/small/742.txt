The Articles of Confederation [[Coming into force|came into force]] on March 1, 1781, after ratification by all the states. A guiding principle of the Articles was to preserve the [[independence]] and [[sovereignty]] of the states. The weak [[central government]] established by the Articles received only those powers which the [[Thirteen Colonies|former colonies]] had recognized as belonging to king and parliament.{{Sfn|Morison|1965|page=279}} \n \n The document provided clearly written rules for how the states'  \" league of friendship \"  would be organized. During the ratification process, the Congress looked to the Articles for guidance as it conducted business, directing the [[American Revolutionary War|war effort]], conducting diplomacy with foreign states, addressing territorial issues and dealing with Native American relations. Little changed politically once the Articles of Confederation went into effect, as ratification did little more than legalize what the Continental Congress had been doing. That body was renamed the Congress of the Confederation; but most Americans continued to call it the ''Continental Congress'', since its organization remained the same.{{Sfn|Morison|1965|page=279}} \n \n As the Confederation Congress attempted to govern the continually growing American states, delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so. As the government's weaknesses became apparent, especially after [[Shays' Rebellion]], some prominent political thinkers in the fledgling union began asking for changes to the Articles. Their hope was to create a stronger government. Initially, some states met to deal with their trade and economic problems. However, as more states became interested in meeting to change the Articles, a meeting was set in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787. This became the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]]. It was quickly agreed that changes would not work, and instead the entire Articles needed to be replaced. < ref > {{Cite web |last=Kelley |first=Martin |title=Why did the Articles of Confederation fail? |url=http://americanhistory.about.com/od/governmentandpolitics/f/articles_of_confederation_fails.htm |access-date=March 2, 2017 |website=[[About Education]]}} < /ref >  On March 4, 1789, the government under the Articles was replaced with the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Rodgers |first=Paul |title=United States Constitutional Law: An Introduction |date=2011 |publisher=[[McFarland  &  Company|McFarland]] |isbn=9780786460175 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WUOXmAEACAAJ & pg=PA109 109]}} < /ref >  The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive (the [[President of the United States|President]]), courts, and taxing powers. \n \n ==Background and context== \n The political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the [[Albany Congress]] in 1754 and [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s proposed [[Albany Plan]], an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems. Over the next two decades, some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen; others would weaken, especially in the degree of loyalty (or lack thereof) owed the Crown. [[Boston Tea Party|Civil disobedience]] resulted in coercive and quelling measures, such as the passage of what the colonials referred to as the [[Intolerable Acts]] in the British Parliament, and [[Battle of Bunker Hill|armed skirmishes]] which resulted in dissidents being [[Proclamation of Rebellion|proclaimed rebels]]. These actions eroded the number of Crown Loyalists ([[Tory|Tories]]) among the colonials and, together with the highly effective propaganda campaign of the Patriot leaders, caused an increasing number of colonists to begin agitating for independence from the mother country. In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the [[Second Continental Congress]] began acting as the [[provisional government]]. \n \n It was an era of constitution writing\u2014most states were busy at the task\u2014and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution; a  \" rulebook \"  for how the new nation should function. During the war, Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political, diplomatic, military and economic authority. It adopted trade restrictions, established and maintained an army, issued [[fiat money]], created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Wood |first=Gordon S. |url=https://archive.org/details/creationofameric0000wood |title=The Creation of the American Republic: 1776\u20131787 |date=1969 |publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/creationofameric0000wood/page/354 354\u201355] |url-access=registration}} < /ref > \n \n To transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation, the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it. In early 1776, [[Thomas Paine]] argued in the closing pages of the first edition of ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' that the  \" custom of nations \"  demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain. The monarchies of France and Spain, in particular, could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch. Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a  \" manifesto \"  which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners. Without such a declaration, Paine concluded,  \" [t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations. \" < ref > {{Cite book |last=Paine |first=Thomas |title=Paine: Collected Writings |date=January 14, 1776 |publisher=[[The Library of America]] |isbn=9781428622005 |editor-last=Foner |editor-first=Eric |editor-link=Eric Foner |page=45\u201346 |chapter=Common Sense |author-link=Thomas Paine}} (Collection published 1995.) < /ref > \n \n Beyond improving their existing [[Continental Association|association]], the records of the [[Second Continental Congress]] show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations. On June 7, 1776, [[Richard Henry Lee]] introduced [[Lee Resolution|a resolution]] before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time, he also urged Congress to resolve  \" to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances \"  and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states. Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration]], a [[Model Treaty|model treaty]], and the Articles of Confederation. The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established  \" a firm league \"  among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs. < ref > {{Cite journal |last=Armitage |first=David |author-link=David Armitage (historian) |date=2004 |title=The Declaration of Independence in World Context |journal=Magazine of History |publisher=[[Organization of American Historians]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |page=61\u201366 |doi=10.1093/maghis/18.3.61}} < /ref > \n \n ==Drafting== \n [[File:Articles of Confederation 13c 1977 issue.JPG|thumb|right|upright=.90|alt=Historical 13-cent postage stamp commemorating the Articles of Confederation 200th anniversary|1977 13-cent U.S. [[Postage stamp]] commemorating the Articles of Confederation bicentennial; the draft was completed on November 15, 1777]] \n On June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states.

The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the confederation's central government. Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national Congress, which was empowered to make war and peace, negotiate diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries, and to resolve disputes between the states. The document also stipulates that its provisions  \" shall be inviolably observed by every state \"  and that  \" [[perpetual Union|the Union shall be perpetual]] \" . \n \n Summary of the purpose and content of each of the 13 articles: \n # Establishes the name of the confederation with these words:  \" The stile of this confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.' \" \n # Asserts the sovereignty of each state, except for the specific powers delegated to the confederation government:  \" Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated. \" \n # Declares the purpose of the confederation:  \" The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them, or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever. \" \n # Elaborates upon the intent  \" to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different States in this union, \"  and to establish [[Equality before the law|equal treatment]] and [[freedom of movement]] for the free inhabitants of each state to pass unhindered between the states, excluding  \" [[pauper]]s, [[vagabond (person)|vagabonds]], and [[fugitive]]s from justice. \"  All these people are entitled to equal rights established by the state into which they travel. If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state, he will be [[extradition|extradited]] to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed. \n # Allocates one vote in the [[Congress of the Confederation]] (the  \" United States in Congress Assembled \" ) to each state, which is entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members. Members of Congress are to be appointed by state legislatures. No congressman may serve more than three out of any six years. \n # Only the central government may declare war, or conduct foreign political or commercial relations. No state or official may accept foreign gifts or titles, and granting any title of nobility is forbidden to all. No states may form any sub-national groups. No state may tax or interfere with treaty stipulations [[Model Treaty|already proposed]]. No state may wage war without permission of Congress, unless invaded or under imminent attack on the frontier; no state may maintain a peacetime standing army or navy, unless infested by pirates, but every State is required to keep ready, a well-trained, disciplined, and equipped [[Militia (United States)|militia]]. \n # Whenever an army is raised for common defense, the state legislatures shall assign military ranks of colonel and below. \n # Expenditures by the United States of America will be paid with funds raised by state legislatures, and apportioned to the states in proportion to the real property values of each. \n # Powers and functions of the United States in Congress Assembled. \n #* Grants to the United States in Congress assembled the sole and exclusive right and power to determine peace and war; to exchange ambassadors; to enter into treaties and alliances, with some provisos; to establish rules for deciding all cases of captures or prizes on land or water; to grant [[Letter of marque|letters of marque and reprisal]] (documents authorizing [[privateer]]s) in times of peace; to appoint courts for the trial of pirates and crimes committed on the high seas; to establish [[Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture|courts for appeals in all cases of captures]], but no member of Congress may be appointed a judge; to set weights and measures (including coins), and for Congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states. \n #* The court will be composed of jointly appointed commissioners or Congress shall appoint them. Each commissioner is bound by oath to be impartial. The court's decision is final. \n #* Congress shall regulate the [[post office]]s; appoint officers in the military; and regulate the armed forces. \n #* The United States in Congress assembled may appoint a president who shall not serve longer than one year per three-year term of the Congress. \n #* Congress may request requisitions (demands for payments or supplies) from the states in proportion with their population, or take credit. \n #* Congress may not declare war, enter into treaties and alliances, appropriate money, or appoint a [[commander in chief]] without nine states assented. Congress shall keep a journal of proceedings and adjourn for periods not to exceed six months. \n # When Congress is in recess, any of the powers of Congress may be executed by  \" The committee of the states, or any nine of them \" , except for those powers of Congress which require nine states ''in'' Congress to execute. \n # If Canada [referring to the British [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]]] accedes to this confederation, it will be admitted. < ref > {{Cite web |title=Avalon Project \u2013 Articles of Confederation : March 1, 1781 |url=https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/artconf.asp |website=avalon.law.yale.edu}} < /ref >  No other colony could be admitted without the consent of nine states. \n #Affirms that the Confederation will honor all [[Engagements Clause#The precursor in the Articles of Confederation|bills of credit incurred, monies borrowed, and debts contracted by Congress]] before the existence of the Articles. \n # Declares that the Articles shall be perpetual, and may be altered only with the approval of Congress and the ratification of all the state legislatures. \n \n ==Congress under the Articles== \n \n ===The army=== \n Under the Articles, Congress had the authority to regulate and fund the [[Continental Army]], but it lacked the power to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or funding. This left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding, supplies, and even food. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Carp |first=E.

The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress. ... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states. Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers, but could not force anyone to supply them, and the army nearly starved in several winters of war.{{Sfn|Chadwick|2002|page=469}}}} \n \n Phelps wrote: \n {{Blockquote|It is hardly surprising, given their painful confrontations with a weak central government and the sovereign states, that the former generals of the Revolution as well as countless lesser officers strongly supported the creation of a more muscular union in the 1780s and fought hard for the ratification of the Constitution in 1787. Their wartime experiences had nationalized them.{{Sfn|Phelps|2001|page=165\u2013166}}}} \n \n The Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life. However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor. No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783\u201384. General [[Henry Knox]], who would later become the first [[Secretary of War]] under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army. The army had long been supportive of a strong union.{{Sfnp|Puls|2008|page=174\u2013176}}Knox wrote: \n \n {{Blockquote|The army generally have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies.

It is a favorite toast in the army,  \" A hoop to the barrel \"  or  \" Cement to the Union \" .{{Sfnp|Puls|2008|page=177}}}} \n \n As Congress failed to act on the petitions, Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris, four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened,  \" As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution. \" {{Sfnp|Puls|2008|page=177}} \n \n Once the war had been won, the [[Continental Army]] was largely disbanded. A very small [[First American Regiment|national force]] was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] attacks. Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had navies. The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met. In 1783, [[George Washington]] defused the [[Newburgh conspiracy]], but riots by unpaid [[Pennsylvania]] veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Lodge |first=Henry Cabot |url=https://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/George-Washington-Vol-I4/#p98 |title=George Washington, Vol. I |date=1893 |volume=I}} < /ref > \n \n The Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states. Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788, the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests. The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs. Dougherty (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis. This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms. < ref > {{Cite journal |last=Dougherty |first=Keith L. |date=Spring 2009 |title=An Empirical Test of Federalist and Anti-Federalist Theories of State Contributions, 1775\u20131783 |journal=Social Science History |volume=33 |issue=1 |page=47\u201374 |doi=10.1215/01455532-2008-015}} < /ref > \n \n ===Foreign policy=== \n {{Main|Confederation Period#Foreign affairs}} \n The 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for several months because too few delegates were present at any one time to constitute a [[quorum]] so that it could be ratified. Afterward, the problem only got worse as Congress had no power to enforce attendance. Rarely did more than half of the roughly sixty delegates attend a session of Congress at the time, causing difficulties in raising a [[quorum]]. The resulting paralysis embarrassed and frustrated many American nationalists, including George Washington. Many of the most prominent national leaders, such as Washington, [[John Adams]], [[John Hancock]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]], retired from public life, served as foreign delegates, or held office in state governments; and for the general public, local government and self-rule seemed quite satisfactory. This served to exacerbate Congress's impotence. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Ferling |first=John |url=https://archive.org/details/leapindark00ferl |title=A Leap in the Dark: The Struggle to Create the American Republic |date=2003 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/leapindark00ferl/page/255 255\u2013259] |url-access=registration}} < /ref > \n \n Inherent weaknesses in the confederation's frame of government also frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy.

In this treaty, which was never ratified, the United States was to give up rights to use the [[Mississippi River]] for 25 years, which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Finally, due to the Confederation's military weakness, it could not compel the [[British army]] to leave frontier forts which were on American soil \u2014 forts which, in 1783, the British promised to leave, but which they delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as ending action against [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s and allowing them to seek compensation. This incomplete British implementation of the Treaty of Paris would later be resolved by the implementation of [[Jay's Treaty]] in 1795 after the federal Constitution came into force. \n \n ===Taxation and commerce=== \n Under the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited. The Confederation Congress could make decisions but lacked enforcement powers. Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.{{Sfnp|Jensen|1950|page=[https://archive.org/details/newnationhistory0000jens_x8b5/page/177 177\u2013233]}} \n \n Congress was denied any powers of [[taxation]]: it could only request money from the states. The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money. As more money was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated. In 1779, George Washington wrote to [[John Jay]], who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress,  \" that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions. \" {{Sfn|Stahr|2005|page=105}} Mr. Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45 & nbsp;million from the States. In an appeal to the States to comply, Jay wrote that the taxes were  \" the price of liberty, the peace, and the safety of yourselves and posterity. \" {{Sfn|Stahr|2005|page=107}} He argued that Americans should avoid having it said  \" that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent \"  or that  \" her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith. \" {{Sfn|Stahr|2005|page=107\u2013108}} The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them. \n \n Congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or [[interstate commerce]] and, as a result, all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies. The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War, and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War. Some States paid off their war debts and others did not. Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention. \n \n ===Accomplishments=== \n {{Details|Admission to the Union#Articles of Confederation}} \n {{More citations needed|section|date=April 2020}} \n \n Nevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two actions with long-lasting impact. The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] and [[Northwest Ordinance]] created territorial government, set up protocols for the [[admission to the Union|admission of new states]] and the division of land into useful units, and set aside land in each township for [[public domain (land)|public use]]. This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as in Europe, and it established the precedent by which the national (later, federal) government would be sovereign and expand westward\u2014as opposed to the existing states doing so under their sovereignty. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Sat\u014d |first=Sh\u014dsuke |url=https://archive.org/details/historylandques00satgoog |title=History of the land question in the United States |date=1886 |publisher=[[Isaac Friedenwald]], for [[Johns Hopkins University]] |location=Baltimore, Maryland |page=352 |access-date=March 9, 2018 |orig-year=Digitized 2008}} < /ref > \n \n The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the [[Mississippi River]]. Frontier lands were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the [[township]] (36 square miles), the [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 [[acre]]s). This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of [[Texas]] and [[California]] that had already been surveyed and divided up by the [[Spanish Empire]]). Then, when the [[Southern Homestead Act of 1866|Homestead Act]] was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers. \n \n The [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up [[state cession|northwestern land claims]], organized the [[Northwest Territory]] and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states. While it didn't happen under the articles, the land north of the [[Ohio River]] and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania ceded by [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]], eventually became the states of: [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], and [[Wisconsin]], and the part of [[Minnesota]] east of the Mississippi River. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery. New states admitted to the union in this territory would never be slave states. \n \n No new states were admitted to the Union under the Articles of Confederation. The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] (referred to as  \" Canada \"  in the Articles) into the United States if it chose to do so. It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission. Additionally, ordinances to admit [[State of Franklin|Frankland]] (later modified to Franklin), [[Kentucky]], and [[Vermont Republic|Vermont]] to the Union were considered, but none were approved. \n \n ===Presidents of Congress=== \n {{Further|President of the Continental Congress}} \n \n Under the Articles of Confederation, the presiding officer of Congress\u2014referred to in many official records as ''President of the United States in Congress Assembled''\u2014chaired the [[Committee of the States]] when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions. He was not, however, an executive in the way the later [[President of the United States]] is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress.{{Sfnp|Jensen|1959|page=178\u2013179}} \n \n There were 10 presidents of Congress under the Articles.

The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation but granted to the Congress\u2014the only federal institution\u2014little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced. There was no president, no executive agencies, no judiciary, and no tax base. The absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states, which seldom arrived. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Morris |first=Richard B. |url=https://archive.org/details/forgingofunion00morr_0 |title=The Forging of the Union, 1781\u20131789 |date=1987 |publisher=[[Harper  &  Row]] |isbn=9780060914240 |page=[https://archive.org/details/forgingofunion00morr_0/page/245 245\u201366] |url-access=registration}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book |last=Frankel |first=Benjamin |title=History in Dispute: The American Revolution, 1763\u20131789 |date=2003 |publisher=[[St. James Press]] |page=17\u201324}} < /ref >  Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak to hold the fast-growing nation together, they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue, as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control. < ref > {{Cite book |last=McNeese |first=Tim |title=Revolutionary America 1764\u20131799 |date=2009 |publisher=[[Chelsea House Publishers]] |isbn=9781604133509 |page=104}} < /ref > \n \n By 1783, with the end of the British blockade, the new nation was regaining its prosperity. However, trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires. The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships. France and Spain established similar policies. Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again. Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution. The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations (debts) incurred during the war, or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development, only aggravated a gloomy situation. In 1786\u201387, [[Shays' Rebellion]], an uprising of dissidents in western Massachusetts against the state court system, threatened the stability of state government. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Murrin |first=John M. |title=Liberty, Equality, Power, A History of the American People: To 1877 |date=2008 |publisher=[[Wadsworth Publishing Company]] |isbn=9781111830861 |page=187}} < /ref > \n \n The Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency, spawning the expression  \" not worth a continental \" . Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States. Less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784, although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone.{{Sfnp|Jensen|1959|page=37}} \n \n When [[John Adams]] went to London in 1785 as the first representative of the United States, he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce. Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty. Adams stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress, or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain. Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws. Meanwhile, each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect. When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping, Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Ferling |first=John |title=John Adams: A Life |date=2010 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA |isbn=9780199752737 |page=257\u20138}} < /ref > \n \n By 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping. State legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit. Land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population.{{Sfnp|Rakove|1988|page= [https://archive.org/details/americanfounding00barl/page/225 225\u201345]}} \n \n The idea of a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation grew in favor. [[Alexander Hamilton]] realized while serving as Washington's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual Congress. Hamilton led a group of like-minded nationalists, won Washington's endorsement, and convened the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]] in 1786 to petition Congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in Philadelphia to remedy the long-term crisis. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Chernow |first=Ron |url=https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher |title=Alexander Hamilton |date=2004 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=9781101200858 |url-access=registration}} < /ref > \n \n ==Signatures== \n The Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15, 1777. A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the [[Continental Congress|Congress]]. On November 28, the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and the cover letter, dated November 17, had only the signatures of [[Henry Laurens]] and [[Charles Thomson]], who were the [[President of the Continental Congress|President]] and Secretary to the Congress. \n \n The Articles, however, were unsigned, and the date was blank. Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the Articles on June 27, 1778. They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification. \n \n On July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready. They dated it and began to sign. They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed. On that date, delegates present from [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]] and [[South Carolina]] signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified. [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]] and [[Maryland]] could not, since their states had not ratified. [[North Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] also were unable to sign that day, since their delegations were absent. \n \n After the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended. For example, John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on August 8. John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the Articles on July 21, 1778. \n \n The other states had to wait until they ratified the Articles and notified their Congressional delegation. Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12, 1779. Maryland [[History of Maryland#The Revolutionary period|refused to ratify]] the Articles until every state had ceded its western land claims. [[Anne-C\u00e9sar, Chevalier de la Luzerne|Chevalier de La Luzerne]], French [[Diplomatic rank|Minister]] to the United States, felt that the Articles would help strengthen the American government. In 1780 when Maryland requested France provide naval forces in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] for protection from the British (who were conducting raids in the lower part of the bay), he indicated that French Admiral [[Charles Ren\u00e9 Dominique Sochet, Chevalier Destouches|Destouches]] would do what he could but La Luzerne also \u201csharply pressed\u201d Maryland to ratify the Articles, thus suggesting the two issues were related. < ref > {{Cite journal |last=Sioussat |first=St. George L. |date=October 1936 |title=THE CHEVALIER DE LA LUZERNE AND THE RATIFICATION OF THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION BY MARYLAND, 1780\u20131781 With Accompanying Documents |url=https://journals.psu.edu/pmhb/article/view/28432/28188 |journal=The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography |volume=60 |issue=4 |page=391\u2013418 |access-date=April 19, 2018}} < /ref > \n \n [[File:Act of Maryland to ratify Articles.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|The Act of the Maryland legislature to ratify the Articles of Confederation, February 2, 1781]] \n On February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the [[Maryland General Assembly]] in [[Annapolis]]. < ref name= \" lawsofmaryland \" > {{Cite web |date=February 2, 1781 |title=An ACT to empower the delegates |url=http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723015508/http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html |archive-date=July 23, 2011 |website=Laws of Maryland, 1781 |df=mdy-all}} < /ref >  As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session,  \" among engrossed Bills \"  was  \" signed and sealed by Governor [[Thomas Sim Lee]] in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation \"  and perpetual union among the states.

At what came to be known as the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]], the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in [[Philadelphia]] in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a  \" Grand Convention. \"  Although the states' representatives to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution. The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed. The general goal of the authors was to get close to a [[republic]] as defined by the philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships. Historian [[Forrest McDonald]], using the ideas of James Madison from ''Federalist 39'', described the change this way: \n \n {{Blockquote \n |The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun. Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states. The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.{{Sfnp|McDonald|1986|page=276}} \n }} \n \n In May 1786, [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]] of [[South Carolina]] proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended changes included granting [[United States Congress|Congress]] power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries. Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus. The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after [[Shays' Rebellion]] threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts. \n \n Historian Ralph Ketcham commented on the opinions of [[Patrick Henry]], [[George Mason]], and other [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]] who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution: \n \n {{Blockquote|Antifederalists feared what Patrick Henry termed the  \" consolidated government \"  proposed by the new Constitution. They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a  \" splendid empire \"  that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns. Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Ketcham |first=Ralph |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QlDPAtJXQu0C & pg=PA381 |title=Roots of the Republic: American Founding Documents Interpreted |date=1990 |publisher=[[Rowman  &  Littlefield]] |isbn=9780945612193 |page=383}} < /ref > }} \n \n Historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787. Jillson and Wilson (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines. \n \n Rakove identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation.{{Sfnp|Rakove|1988}} The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power. It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by [[Rhode Island]]. Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures  \" stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace. \" {{Sfnp|Rakove|1988|page=230}} The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy. Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power. \n \n When the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new  \" merchant state, \"  much like the British state people had rebelled against. In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims. Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.{{Sfnp|Hendrickson|2003|page=154}} \n \n ===Legitimacy of closing down=== \n Two prominent political leaders in the Confederation, [[John Jay]] of New York and [[Thomas Burke (governor)|Thomas Burke]] of North Carolina believed that  \" the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges. \" {{Sfnp|Hendrickson|2003|page=153\u2013154}} \n \n According to Article XIII of the Confederation, any alteration had to be approved unanimously: \n \n < blockquote > [T]he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State. < /blockquote > \n \n On the other hand, Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states, without unanimity: \n \n < blockquote > The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same. < /blockquote > \n \n The apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion. In 1788, [[James Madison]] remarked (in ''[[Federalist No. 40]]'') that the issue had become moot:  \" As this objection\u2026 has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without further observation. \"  Nevertheless, it is a historical and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground. At the time, there were state legislators who argued that the Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation, but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply.{{Sfnp|Maier|2010|page=62}} Moreover, the Confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding.{{Sfnp|Maier|2010|page=62}} \n \n Modern scholars such as Francisco Forrest Martin agree that the Articles of Confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it, and thus  \" other states-parties did not have to comply with the Articles' unanimous consent rule \" . < ref > {{Cite book |last=Martin |first=Francisco |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xNEjqp2A6ZgC & pg=PA5 |title=The Constitution as Treaty: The International Legal Constructionalist Approach to the U.S. Constitution |date=2007 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=5}} < /ref >  In contrast, law professor [[Akhil Amar]] suggests that there may not have really been any conflict between the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution on this point; Article VI of the Confederation specifically allowed side deals among states, and the Constitution could be viewed as a side deal until all states ratified it. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Amar |first=Akhil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfkJRm6VCQ0C & pg=PA517 |title=America's Constitution: A Biography |date=2012 |publisher=[[Random House]] |page=517 |author-link=Akhil Amar}} < /ref > \n \n ===Final months=== \n On July 3, 1788, the Congress received [[New Hampshire]]'s all-important ninth ratification of the proposed Constitution, thus, according to its terms, establishing it as the new framework of governance for the ratifying states.
