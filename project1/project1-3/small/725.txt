In 1861, Arkansas seceded from the United States and joined the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. On returning to the Union in 1868, Arkansas continued to suffer economically, due to its overreliance on the large-scale [[plantation economy]]. Cotton remained the leading commodity crop, and the cotton market declined. Because farmers and businessmen did not diversify and there was little industrial investment, the state fell behind in economic opportunity. In the late 19th century, the state instituted various [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and segregate the African-American population. During the 1950s, during the [[civil rights movement]], Arkansas and particularly Little Rock were major battlegrounds for efforts to integrate schools. \n \n [[White American|White]] interests dominated Arkansas's politics, with disfranchisement of African Americans and refusal to reapportion the legislature. Only after the [[civil rights movement]] and federal intervention were more African Americans able to vote. The Supreme Court overturned rural domination in the South and other states that had refused to reapportion their state legislatures or retained rules based on geographic districts. In the landmark ruling of ''[[one man, one vote]]'', it held that states had to organize their legislatures by districts that held approximately equal populations, and that these had to be redefined as necessary after each decade's census. \n \n After [[World War II]], Arkansas began to diversify its economy and see prosperity. During the 1960s, the state became the base of the [[Walmart]] corporation, the world's largest retailer, headquartered in [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]]. In the 21st century, its economy is based on service industries, aircraft, poultry, steel, and tourism, along with important commodity crops of cotton, [[soybeans]] and [[rice]].  \n \n [[culture of Arkansas|Arkansas's culture]] is observable in museums, theaters, novels, television shows, restaurants, and athletic venues across the state.

A typical year brings thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, snow and ice storms. Between both the [[Great Plains]] and the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf States]], Arkansas, receives around 60 days of thunderstorms. Arkansas is located in [[Tornado Alley]], and as a result, a few of the most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state. While sufficiently far from the coast to avoid a direct hit from a hurricane, Arkansas can often get the remnants of a [[tropical cyclone|tropical system]], which dumps tremendous amounts of rain in a short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes. \n \n {| class= \" wikitable \"   \" text-align:center;font-size:90%; \" | \n | colspan= \" 14 \"  style= \" text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA; \" |Monthly Normal High and Low Temperatures For Various Arkansas Cities \n |- \n !

The [[Caddo]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], and [[Quapaw]] peoples encountered European explorers. The first of these Europeans was Spanish explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] in 1541, who crossed the Mississippi and marched across central Arkansas and the Ozark Mountains. After finding nothing he considered of value and encountering native resistance the entire way, he and his men returned to the Mississippi River where de Soto fell ill. From his deathbed he ordered his men to massacre all the men of the nearby village of Anilco, who he feared had been plotting with a powerful polity down the Mississippi River, ''[[Quigualtam]]''. His men obeyed and did not stop with the men, but were said to have massacred women and children as well. He died the following day in what is believed to be the vicinity of modern-day [[McArthur, Arkansas]], in May 1542. His body was weighted down with sand and he was consigned to a watery grave in the Mississippi River under cover of darkness by his men. De Soto had attempted to deceive the native population into thinking he was an immortal deity, sun of the sun, in order to forestall attack by outraged Native Americans on his by then weakened and bedraggled army. In order to keep the ruse up, his men informed the locals that de Soto had ascended into the sky. His will at the time of his death listed  \" four Indian slaves, three horses and 700 hogs \"  which were auctioned off. The starving men, who had been living off maize stolen from natives, immediately started butchering the hogs and later, commanded by former [[aide-de-camp]] Moscoso, attempted an overland return to Mexico. They made it as far as Texas before running into territory too dry for maize farming and too thinly populated to sustain themselves by stealing food from the locals. The expedition promptly backtracked to Arkansas. After building a small fleet of boats they then headed down the Mississippi River and eventually on to Mexico by water. < ref name=HUDSONKNIGHTS > {{cite book| author-link =Charles M.

The region was organized as the [[Territory of Arkansaw]] on July 4, 1819, with the territory admitted to the United States as the state of Arkansas on June 15, 1836. The name was historically {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0251r|k|\u0259n|s|\u0254\u02d0}}, {{IPAc-en|\u0251r|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|n|z|\u0259|s}}, and several other variants. Historically and modernly, the people of Arkansas call themselves either  \" Arkansans \"  or  \" Arkansawyers \" . In 1881, the [[Arkansas General Assembly]] passed Arkansas Code 1-4-105 (official text): \n < blockquote > Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings. < /blockquote > \n < blockquote > And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants. < /blockquote > \n < blockquote > Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final  \" s \"  silent, the  \" a \"  in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of  \" a \"  in  \" man \"  and the sounding of the terminal  \" s \"  is an innovation to be discouraged. < /blockquote > \n Citizens of the [[state of Kansas]] often pronounce the [[Arkansas River]] as {{IPAc-en|\u0251r|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|n|z|\u0259|s|_|\u02c8|r|\u026a|v|\u0259r}}, in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state. \n \n Settlers, such as fur trappers, moved to Arkansas in the early 18th century.

The bloody [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] just across the border in Missouri shocked many Arkansans who thought the war would be a quick and decisive Southern victory. Battles early in the war took place in northwest Arkansas, including the [[Battle of Cane Hill]], [[Battle of Pea Ridge]], and [[Battle of Prairie Grove]]. Union general [[Samuel Ryan Curtis|Samuel Curtis]] swept across the state to [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas|Helena]] in the Delta in 1862. Little Rock was captured the following year. The government shifted the state Confederate capital to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], and then again to [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]] from 1863 to 1865, for the remainder of the war.

The Republican-controlled reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage (though temporarily disfranchising former Confederate Army officers, who were all Democrats), a public education system for blacks and whites, and passed general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. The State soon came under control of the [[Radical Republicans]] and Unionists, and led by Governor [[Powell Clayton]], they presided over a time of great upheaval as Confederate sympathizers and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] fought the new developments, particularly voting rights for African Americans. \n \n ===End of the Reconstruction=== \n In 1874, the [[Brooks-Baxter War]], a political struggle between factions of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] shook Little Rock and the state governorship.

(See Law and Government below.) \n \n After Reconstruction, the state began to receive more [[immigrants]] and [[migrant worker|migrants]]. Chinese, [[Italians|Italian]], and [[Syrian]] men were recruited for farm labor in the developing Delta region.

It also brought new development into different parts of the state, including the Ozarks, where some areas were developed as resorts. In a few years at the end of the 19th century, for instance, [[Eureka Springs]] in [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]] grew to 10,000 people, rapidly becoming a tourist destination and the fourth-largest city of the state. It featured newly constructed, elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its natural springs, considered to have healthful properties. The town's attractions included horse racing and other entertainment. It appealed to a wide variety of classes, becoming almost as popular as [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]]. \n \n ===Rise of the Jim Crow laws=== \n {{See also|Elaine massacre}} \n In the late 1880s, the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling to stay in power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] blacks and poor whites. In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a [[literacy test]], knowing it would exclude many blacks and whites. At the time, more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892, they amended the state constitution to require a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and more complex residency requirements, both of which adversely affected poor people and sharecroppers, forcing most blacks and many poor whites from voter rolls. \n \n [[File:Colored boys playing on top of Coca Cola stand.

Only in the primary was there any competition among candidates, as Democrats held all the power. The state was a Democratic one-party state for decades, until after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] to enforce constitutional rights. < ref > [http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=800 & issue_id=36 & page=3  \" White Primary \"  System Bars Blacks from Politics\u20141900, ''The Arkansas News'', Old State House, Spring 1987, p.3.

The Germans were mostly Lutheran and the Slovaks were primarily Catholic. The Irish were mostly Protestant from [[Ulster]], of Scots and Northern Borders descent. \n \n Black sharecroppers began to try to organize a farmers' union after World War{{nbs}}I. They were seeking better conditions of payment and accounting from white landowners of the area cotton plantations. Whites resisted any change and often tried to break up their meetings. On September 30, 1919, two white men, including a local deputy, tried to break up a meeting of black sharecroppers who were trying to organize a farmers' union. After a white deputy was killed in a confrontation with guards at the meeting, word spread to town and around the area.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Hundreds of whites from Phillips and neighboring areas rushed to suppress the blacks, and started attacking blacks at large.

After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President [[Dwight D.

Two other small Arkansas colleges compete in [[NCAA Division & nbsp;III]], in which [[athletic scholarship]]s are prohibited. High school football also began to grow in Arkansas in the early 20th century. \n \n Baseball runs deep in Arkansas and has been popular before the state hosted [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[spring training]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]] from 1886 to the 1920s. Two [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] teams are based in the state.
