While making an album with Maal in Senegal, Emmerson was struck by the similarity between one African melody and a traditional Irish air. Back in London, Irish musician [[Davy Spillane]] told Emmerson about a belief that nomadic Celts lived in Africa or India before they migrated to Western Europe. Whether or not the theory was true, Emmerson was intrigued by the two countries' musical affinities. \n \n In an experiment that would prove successful, Emmerson brought two members of Baaba Maal's band together with traditional Irish musicians to see what kind of music the two groups would create. Adding a dash of modern sound, Emmerson also brought in English dance mixers for an electronic beat.  \" People thought I was mad when I touted the idea, \"  Emmerson told Jim Carroll of ''[[The Irish Times]]''.  \" At the time, I was out of favour with the London club scene. I was broke and on income support but the success was extraordinary \" . < ref name= \" Jim Carroll \" > {{cite news|first=Jim|last=Carroll |url = http://www.irishtimes.com/news/celts-get-afro-beat-1.317903|title = Celts get Afro beat|newspaper = [[The Irish Times]]|date = 14 July 2001|access-date = 15 February 2016}} < /ref > \n \n ==Career== \n Jamming in the studios at Real World, musician Peter Gabriel's recording facilities in [[Wiltshire, England]], the group of musicians recorded the basis of their first album in one week. This album, ''[[Volume 1: Sound Magic]]'', was released by Real World Records in 1996, and marked the debut of the Afro Celt Sound System. < ref name= \" LarkinDM \" > {{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=9}} < /ref > \n \n \" Prior to that first album being made, none of us knew if it would work, \"  musician James McNally told Larry Katz of the Boston Herald.  \" We were strangers who didn't even speak the same language. But we were bowled over by this communication that took place beyond language. \" {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} McNally, who grew up second-generation Irish in London, played whistles, keyboards, piano, [[bodhran]], and bamboo flute. \n \n ''Sound Magic'' has now sold over 300,000 copies. The band performed at festivals, raves, and dance clubs and regularly included two African musicians, Moussa Sissokho on talking drum and djembe and [[N'Faly Kouyate]] on vocals, [[Kora (instrument)|kora]] and [[balafon]]. \n \n Just as the second album was getting off the ground, one of the group's core musicians, 27-year-old [[keyboardist]] Jo Bruce, (son of [[Cream (band)|Cream]] bass player [[Jack Bruce]]), died suddenly of an [[asthma]] attack. < ref name= \" LarkinDM \" / >  The band was devastated, and the album was put on hold. [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] then collaborated with the band and helped them cope with their loss.  \" [O'Connor] blew into the studio on a windy November night and blew away again leaving us something incredibly emotional and powerful, \"  McNally told Katz.  \" We had this track we didn't know what to do with. Sin\u00e9ad scribbled a few lyrics and bang! She left us completely choked up. \" {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} The band used the name of O'Connor's song,  \" Release \" , for the title of their album. ''[[Volume 2: Release]]'' was released in 1999, and by the spring of 2000 it had sold more than half a million copies worldwide. ''Release'' is also used as one of the GCSE music set works in the UK that students are required to study for their exam. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Release - Afro Celt Sound System: Release - Edexcel - GCSE Music Revision - Edexcel|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zvw8jty/revision/1|access-date=2020-09-28|website=BBC Bitesize|language=en-GB}} < /ref > \n \n In 2000, the group was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the Best World Music category. The band, composed at the time of eight members from six countries (the UK, [[Senegal]], Guinea, Ireland, France and [[Kenya]]), took pride in its ability to bring people together through music.  \" We can communicate anywhere at any corner of the planet and feel that we're at home, \"  McNally told Patrick MacDonald of ''[[The Seattle Times]]''.  \" We're breaking down categories of world music and rock music and black music. We leave a door open to communicate with each other's traditions. And it's changed our lives \" .{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} \n \n In 2001, the group released ''[[Volume 3: Further in Time]]'', which climbed to number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Top World Music Albums chart. Featuring guest spots by Peter Gabriel and [[Robert Plant]], the album also incorporated a heightened African sound.  \" On the first two records, the pendulum swung more toward the Celtic, London club side of the equation, \"  Emmerson told ''The Irish Times''{{'}} Carroll.  \" For this one, we wanted to have more African vocals and input than we'd done before. \" < ref name= \" Jim Carroll \" / >  Again the Afro Celt Sound System met with success. Chuck Taylor of ''Billboard'' praised the album as  \" a cultural phenomenon that bursts past the traditional boundaries of contemporary music. \" {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} The single  \" [[When You're Falling]] \" , with vocals by Gabriel, became a radio hit in the United States. \n \n In 2003, for the ''[[Seed (Afro Celt Sound System album)|Seed]]'' album, they changed their name to Afrocelts. They reverted to the longer band name for their subsequent albums, ''[[Pod (Afro Celt Sound System album)|Pod]]'', a compilation of new mixes of songs from the first four albums, ''[[Volume 5: Anatomic]]'' (their fifth studio album), and ''Capture (1995\u20132010)''. \n \n They played a number of shows to promote ''Volume 5: Anatomic'' in 2006 and summer 2007, ending with a gig in Korea, < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.afrocelts.org/wst_page9.html |title=Afro Celt Sound System Fan Website - ACSS News |publisher=Afrocelts.org |access-date=2014-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620120502/http://www.afrocelts.org/wst_page9.html |archive-date=20 June 2010 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  before taking an extended break to work on side projects, amongst them ''[[The Imagined Village]]'' featuring Simon Emmerson and Johnny Kalsi.

Further performances continue to the present day, and a new album-in-progress titled ''Born'' was announced on their website in 2014. Following the split (see below), Emmerson's version of the band released the album The Source in 2016. \n \n == Split == \n During 2015, the band had split into two formations, one of them including [[Simon Emmerson]], [[N'Faly Kouyate]] and [[Johnny Kalsi]], the other one [[James McNally (musician)|James McNally]] and [[Martin Russell]].

The divided grouping of the band into two versions, both operating under the name Afro Celt Sound System, began in January 2016 and was resolved in December 2016 after McNally and Russell agreed to work under a different name from Emmerson. \n   \n *[[Simon Emmerson]] \n *[[N'Faly Kouyate]] \n *[[Johnny Kalsi]] \n *Moussa Sissokho \n *[[Griogair Labhruidh]] \n *[[Ronan Browne]] \n *Emer Mayock \n *[[Davy Spillane]] \n \n '''Russell/McNally version''' \n *[[Martin Russell]] \n *[[James McNally (musician)|James McNally]] \n *Ian Markin \n *Tim Bradshaw \n *Babara Bangoura \n *Dorothee Munyaneza \n *Kadially Kouyat\u00e9 \n *[[Dav Daheley]] \n \n Other musicians who have performed or recorded with Afro Celt Sound System include: [[Jimmy Mahon]], Demba Barry, [[Babara Bangoura]], [[Iarla \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Robert Plant]], [[Pete Lockett]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]], [[Pina Kollar]], [[Dorothee Munyaneza]], [[Sevara Nazarkhan]], [[Simon Massey]], [[Jesse Cook]], [[Martin Hayes (musician)|Martin Hayes]], [[Eileen Ivers]], [[Mundy]], [[Mair\u00e9ad N\u00ed Mhaonaigh]] and [[Ciar\u00e1n Tourish]] of [[Altan (band)|Altan]], [[Ronan Browne]], [[Michael McGoldrick]], [[Myrdhin]], [[Shooglenifty]], [[Mairead Nesbitt]], [[Nigel Eaton]], [[Davy Spillane]], [[Jonas Bruce]], [[Heather Nova]], [[Julie Murphy (singer)|Julie Murphy]] and [[Ayub Ogada]], [[Caroline Lavelle]], Ross Ainslie. < ref > {{cite web |work = The Barbican |title = Afro Celt Sound System |url = http://www.barbican.org.uk/music/event-detail.asp?ID=19669 |access-date = 7 July 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160820224427/http://www.barbican.org.uk/music/event-detail.asp?ID=19669 |archive-date = 20 August 2016 |url-status = dead |df = dmy-all }} < /ref > \n \n == Discography == \n ===Studio albums=== \n {| class= \" wikitable plainrowheaders \"  style= \" text-align:center \" \n |+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions \n ! scope= \" col \"  rowspan= \" 2 \" | Title \n ! scope= \" col \"  rowspan= \" 2 \" | Year \n ! scope= \" col \"  colspan= \" 7 \" | Peak chart positions \n |- \n ! scope= \" col \"  style= \" width:2.5em;font-size:90%; \" | [[UK Albums Chart|UK]] < br / > < ref name= \" UK \" > Peaks in the UK: \n * All except noted: {{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/1622/afro-celt-sound-system/|title=Afro Celt Sound System {{!}} full Official Chart history|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=5 December 2020}} \n *  \" When You're Falling \" : {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_A.HTM|title=Chart Log UK 1994\u20132010: A \u2013 Azzido Da Bass|website=zobbel.de|access-date=5 December 2020}} < /ref > \n ! scope= \" col \"  style= \" width:2.5em;font-size:90%; \" | [[ARIA Charts|AUS]] < br / > < ref name= \" AUS \" > {{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Gavin|title=Australia's Music Charts 1988\u20132010|year=2011|publisher=Moonlight Publishing|location=Mt.
