An alpha particle is identical to the nucleus of a [[helium-4]] atom, which consists of two [[proton]]s and two [[neutron]]s. It has a charge of {{val|+2|ul=e}} and a mass of {{val|4|ul=u}}.  For example, [[uranium-238]] decays to form [[thorium-234]]. Alpha particles have a [[electric charge|charge]] {{val|+2|u=e}}, but as a nuclear equation describes a nuclear reaction without considering the electrons \u2013 a convention that does not imply that the nuclei necessarily occur in neutral atoms \u2013 the charge is not usually shown. \n Alpha decay typically occurs in the heaviest nuclides. Theoretically, it can occur only in nuclei somewhat heavier than [[nickel]] (element 28), where the overall [[binding energy]] per [[nucleon]] is no longer a maximum and the nuclides are therefore unstable toward spontaneous fission-type processes. In practice, this mode of decay has only been observed in nuclides considerably heavier than nickel, with the lightest known alpha emitters being the lightest [[isotope]]s (mass numbers 104\u2013109) of [[tellurium]] (element 52). Exceptionally, however, [[Isotopes of beryllium|beryllium-8]] decays to two alpha particles. \n Alpha decay is by far the most common form of [[cluster decay]], where the parent [[atom]] ejects a defined [[decay product|daughter]] collection of nucleons, leaving another defined product behind. It is the most common form because of the combined extremely high [[nuclear binding energy]] and a relatively small mass of the alpha particle. Like other cluster decays, alpha decay is fundamentally a [[quantum tunneling]] process. Unlike [[beta decay]], it is governed by the interplay between both the [[nuclear force]] and the [[electromagnetic force]]. \n [[Alpha particle]]s have a typical kinetic energy of 5 & nbsp;MeV (or \u2248 & nbsp;0.13% of their total energy, 110 & nbsp;TJ/kg) and have a speed of about 15,000,000 & nbsp;m/s, or 5% of the [[speed of light]]. There is surprisingly small variation around this energy, due to [[Geiger\u2013Nuttall law|the heavy dependence]] of the half-life of this process on the energy produced. Because of their relatively large mass, the electric charge of {{val|+2|u=e}} and relatively low velocity, alpha particles are very likely to interact with other atoms and lose their energy, and their forward motion can be stopped by a few centimeters of [[air]].  \n Approximately 99% of the [[helium]] produced on [[Earth]] is the result of the alpha decay of underground deposits of [[mineral]]s containing [[uranium]] or [[thorium]]. The helium is brought to the surface as a by-product of [[natural gas]] production. \n \n ==History==  \n {{See also|Alpha particle#History of discovery and use}} \n Alpha particles were first described in the investigations of radioactivity by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in 1899, and by 1907 they were identified as He < sup > 2+ < /sup >  ions. \n By 1928, [[George Gamow]] had solved the theory of alpha decay via tunneling. The alpha particle is trapped inside the nucleus by an attractive nuclear [[potential well]]  \n and a repulsive electromagnetic [[potential barrier]]. Classically, it is forbidden to escape, but according to the (then) newly discovered principles of [[quantum mechanics]], it has a tiny (but non-zero) probability of  \" [[quantum tunneling |tunneling]] \"  through the [[potential barrier|barrier]] and appearing on the other side to escape the nucleus. Gamow solved a model potential for the nucleus and derived, from first principles, a relationship between the [[half-life]] of the decay, and the energy of the emission, which had been previously discovered empirically, and was known as the [[Geiger\u2013Nuttall law]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.phy.uct.ac.za/courses/phy300w/np/ch1/node38.html |title=Gamow theory of alpha decay |date=6 November 1996 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224200050/http://www.phy.uct.ac.za/courses/phy300w/np/ch1/node38.html |archive-date=24 February 2009}} < /ref > \n \n ==Mechanism== \n \n The [[nuclear force]] holding an atomic nucleus together is very strong, in general much stronger than the repulsive [[electromagnetic force]]s between the protons. However, the nuclear force is also short-range, dropping quickly in strength beyond about 1 [[femtometre|femtometer]], while the electromagnetic force has an unlimited range. The strength of the attractive nuclear force keeping a nucleus together is thus proportional to the number of nucleons, but the total disruptive electromagnetic force trying to break the nucleus apart is roughly proportional to the square of its atomic number. A nucleus with 210 or more nucleons is so large that the [[strong nuclear force]] holding it together can just barely counterbalance the electromagnetic repulsion between the protons it contains. Alpha decay occurs in such nuclei as a means of increasing stability by reducing size. < ref name=beiser > {{cite book \n   |title=Concepts of Modern Physics \n   |url=http://phy240.ahepl.org/Concepts_of_Modern_Physics_by_Beiser.pdf \n   |year=2003 \n   |publisher=McGraw-Hill \n   |isbn=0-07-244848-2 \n   |chapter=Chapter 12: Nuclear Transformations \n   |pages=432\u2013434 \n   |edition=6th \n   |author1=Arthur Beiser \n   |access-date=2016-07-03 \n   |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004204701/http://phy240.ahepl.org/Concepts_of_Modern_Physics_by_Beiser.pdf \n   |archive-date=2016-10-04 \n   |url-status=dead \n   }} < /ref > \n \n One curiosity is why alpha particles, helium nuclei, should be preferentially emitted as opposed to other particles like a single [[proton emission|proton]] or [[neutron emission|neutron]] or [[cluster decay|other atomic nuclei]]. < ref group= \" note \" > These other decay modes, while possible, are extremely rare compared to alpha decay. < /ref >  Part of the reason is the high [[binding energy]] of the alpha particle, which means that its mass is less than the sum of the masses of two protons and two neutrons. This increases the disintegration energy. Computing the total disintegration energy given by the equation \n : < math > E = (m_\\text{i} - m_\\text{f} - m_\\text{p})c^2 < /math > \n where {{math|''m'' < sub > i < /sub > }} is the initial mass of the nucleus, {{math|''m'' < sub > f < /sub > }} is the mass of the nucleus after particle emission, and {{math|''m'' < sub > p < /sub > }} is the mass of the emitted particle, one finds that in certain cases it is positive and so alpha particle emission is possible, whereas other decay modes would require energy to be added. For example, performing the calculation for [[uranium-232]] shows that alpha particle emission gives 5.4 & nbsp;MeV of energy, while a single proton emission would '''require''' 6.1 & nbsp;MeV. Most of the disintegration energy becomes the [[kinetic energy]] of the alpha particle itself, although to maintain [[conservation of momentum]] part of the energy goes to the recoil of the nucleus itself (see [[Atomic recoil]]). However, since the mass numbers of most alpha-emitting radioisotopes exceed 210, far greater than the mass number of the alpha particle (4) the fraction of the energy going to the recoil of the nucleus is generally quite small, less than 2%, < ref name= \" beiser \" / >  however the recoil energy (on the scale of keV) is still much larger than the strength of chemical bonds (on the scale of eV), so the daughter nuclide will break away from the chemical environment the parent was in. The energies and ratios of the alpha particles can be used to identify the radioactive parent via [[Alpha-particle spectroscopy|alpha spectrometry]]. \n \n These disintegration energies, however, are substantially smaller than the repulsive [[potential barrier]] created by the electromagnetic force, which prevents the alpha particle from escaping. The energy needed to bring an alpha particle from infinity to a point near the nucleus just outside the range of the nuclear force's influence is generally in the range of about 25 & nbsp;MeV. An alpha particle can be thought of as being inside a potential barrier whose walls are 25 & nbsp;MeV above the potential at infinity. However, decay alpha particles only have energies of around 4 to 9 & nbsp;MeV above the potential at infinity, far less than the energy needed to escape. \n \n Quantum mechanics, however, allows the alpha particle to escape via quantum tunneling.

Essentially, the alpha particle escapes from the nucleus not by acquiring enough energy to pass over the wall confining it, but by tunneling through the wall. Gurney and Condon made the following observation in their paper on it: \n < blockquote > It has hitherto been necessary to postulate some special arbitrary \u2018instability\u2019 of the nucleus, but in the following note, it is pointed out that disintegration is a natural consequence of the laws of quantum mechanics without any special hypothesis... Much has been written of the explosive violence with which the  & alpha;-particle is hurled from its place in the nucleus. But from the process pictured above, one would rather say that the  & alpha;-particle almost slips away unnoticed. < ref name= \" gurney-Condon \" / > < /blockquote > \n \n The theory supposes that the alpha particle can be considered an independent particle within a nucleus, that is in constant motion but held within the nucleus by strong interaction. At each collision with the repulsive potential barrier of the electromagnetic force, there is a small non-zero probability that it will tunnel its way out. An alpha particle with a speed of 1.5\u00d710 < sup > 7 < /sup > & nbsp;m/s within a nuclear diameter of approximately 10 < sup > \u221214 < /sup > & nbsp;m will collide with the barrier more than 10 < sup > 21 < /sup >  times per second. However, if the probability of escape at each collision is very small, the half-life of the radioisotope will be very long, since it is the time required for the total probability of escape to reach 50%. As an extreme example, the half-life of the isotope [[bismuth-209]] is {{val|2.01|e=19|u=years}}. \n \n The isotopes in [[beta-decay stable isobars]] that are also stable with regards to [[double beta decay]] with [[mass number]] ''A'' & nbsp;= & nbsp;5, ''A'' & nbsp;= & nbsp;8, 143 & nbsp;\u2264 & nbsp;''A'' & nbsp;\u2264 & nbsp;155, 160 & nbsp;\u2264 & nbsp;''A'' & nbsp;\u2264 & nbsp;162, and ''A'' & nbsp;\u2265 & nbsp;165 are theorized to undergo alpha decay. All other mass numbers ([[isobar (nuclide)|isobar]]s) have exactly one theoretically [[stable nuclide]]). Those with mass 5 decay to helium-4 and a [[proton]] or a [[neutron]], and those with mass 8 decay to two helium-4 nuclei; their half-lives ([[helium-5]], [[lithium-5]], and [[beryllium-8]]) are very short, unlike the half-lives for all other such nuclides with ''A'' & nbsp;\u2264 & nbsp;209, which are very long.

The alpha particles [[Ionization|ionize]] air in an open [[ion chamber]] and a small [[Electric current|current]] flows through the ionized air. Smoke particles from the fire that enter the chamber reduce the current, triggering the smoke detector's alarm. \n \n [[Radium-223]] is also an [[alpha emitter]].

This increases the chance of [[double-strand break]]s to the DNA in cases of internal contamination, when ingested, inhaled, injected or introduced through the skin. Otherwise, touching an alpha source is typically not harmful, as alpha particles are effectively shielded by a few centimeters of air, a piece of paper, or the thin layer of dead skin cells that make up the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]; however, many alpha sources are also accompanied by [[beta decay|beta-emitting]] radio daughters, and both are often accompanied by gamma photon emission. \n \n [[Relative biological effectiveness]] (RBE) quantifies the ability of radiation to cause certain biological effects, notably either [[cancer]] or [[necrosis|cell-death]], for equivalent radiation exposure. Alpha radiation has a high [[linear energy transfer]] (LET) coefficient, which is about one ionization of a molecule/atom for every [[angstrom]] of travel by the alpha particle. The RBE has been set at the value of 20 for alpha radiation by various government regulations. The RBE is set at 10 for [[neutron]] irradiation, and at 1 for [[Beta decay|beta radiation]] and ionizing photons. \n \n However, the [[Atomic recoil|recoil]] of the parent nucleus (alpha recoil) gives it a significant amount of energy, which also causes ionization damage (see [[ionizing radiation]]). This energy is roughly the weight of the alpha (4 & nbsp;[[Atomic mass unit|u]]) divided by the weight of the parent (typically about 200 & nbsp;u) times the total energy of the alpha. By some estimates, this might account for most of the internal radiation damage, as the recoil nucleus is part of an atom that is much larger than an alpha particle, and causes a very dense trail of ionization; the atom is typically a [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]], which preferentially collect on the [[chromosome]]s.
