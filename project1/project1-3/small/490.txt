A [[Neoplatonist]], he was the son of the philosophers [[Hermias (philosopher)|Hermias]] and [[Aedesia]], the brother of [[Heliodorus of Alexandria]] and the grandson of [[Syrianus]]. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >  Ammonius was a pupil of [[Proclus]] in [[History of Athens#Roman Athens|Roman Athens]], and taught at Alexandria for most of his life, having obtained a public [[Chair (academia)|chair]] in the 470s. \n \n According to Olympiodorus of Thebes's ''Commentaries'' on Plato's [[Gorgias (dialogue)|''Gorgias'']] and ''[[Phaedo]]'' texts, Ammonius gave lectures on the works of Plato, Aristotle, and [[Porphyry of Tyre]]. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >  According to Olympiodorus, Ammonius wrote [[Commentaries on Aristotle|commentaries on Aristotelian works]], three lost [[Commentaries on Plato|commentaries on Platonic texts]]. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >  He is also the author of a text on the [[astrolabe]] published in the ''[[Catalogus Codicum Astrologorum Graecorum]]'', and lectured on [[Ancient Greek astronomy|astronomy]] and [[Ancient Greek geometry|geometry]]. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >  He taught numerous [[Neoplatonists]], including [[Damascius]], [[Olympiodorus of Thebes]], [[John Philoponus]], [[Simplicius of Cilicia]], and [[Asclepius of Tralles]]. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >  Besides them, he taught the physician [[Gessius of Petra]] and the [[ecclesiastical historian]] [[Zacharias Rhetor]], who became the [[bishop]] of [[Mytilene]]. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / > \n \n As part of the [[persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]], the [[Alexandrian school]] was investigated by the Roman imperial authorities; the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], [[Peter III of Alexandria|Peter III]] ({{Reign|477|489}})  Ammonius would limit his teaching in return for keeping his own position. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >  This alienated a number of his colleagues and pupils, including Damascius, who nonetheless called him  \" the greatest commentator who ever lived \"  in his own ''Life of [[Isidore of Alexandria]]''. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / > \n \n ==Life== \n Ammonius' father [[Hermias (philosopher)|Hermias]] died when he was a child, and his mother Aedesia raised him and his brother Heliodorus in Alexandria. When they reached adulthood, Aedesia accompanied her sons to [[Athens]] where they studied under [[Proclus]]. Eventually, they returned to Alexandria where Ammonius, as head of the Neoplatonist school in the city, lectured on [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] for the rest of his life. According to Damascius, during the persecution of the [[paganism|pagans]] at Alexandria in the late 480s, Ammonius made concessions to the [[Christianity|Christian]] authorities so that he could continue his lectures. < ref > Damascius, ''Philosophos Historia'', 118B, Athanassiadi < /ref >  Damascius, who scolds Ammonius for the agreement that he made, does not say what the concessions were, but it may have involved limitations on the doctrines he could teach or promote. He was still teaching in 515; [[Olympiodorus the Younger|Olympiodorus]] heard him lecture on Plato's ''Gorgias'' in that year. < ref > Olympiodorus, ''in Gorgias'', 199, 8\u201310 < /ref >  He was also an accomplished astronomer; he lectured on [[Ptolemy]] and is known to have written a treatise on the [[astrolabe]]. \n \n ==Writings== \n [[File:Ammonios Hermeiou.jpg|thumb|right|First page of the [[editio princeps|first edition]] of the ''Isagoge'' commentary, Venice 1500]] \n Of his reputedly numerous writings, only his commentary on Aristotle's ''De Interpretatione'' survives intact. A commentary on [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''[[Isagoge]]'' may also be his, but it is somewhat corrupt and contains later interpolations. \n \n In ''De Interpretatione'', Ammonius contends that divine foreknowledge makes void the contingent. Like [[Boethius|Bo\u00ebthius]] in his second ''Commentary'' and in ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]],'' this argument maintains the effectiveness of prayer. Ammonius cites [[Iamblichus]], who said  \" knowledge is intermediate between the knower and the known, since it is the activity of the knower concerning the known. \" < ref > \n ''Medieval Philosophy and the Classical Tradition'', Curzon Press, John Inglis, 2002, pg. 128. < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Tempelis|first=Elias|date=1997|title=Iamblichus and the School of Ammonius, Son of Hermias, On Divine Omniscience|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/content/crossref/journals/syllecta_classica/v008/8.tempelis.html|journal=Syllecta Classica|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=207\u2013217|doi=10.1353/syl.1997.0005|issn=2160-5157}} < /ref > \n \n In addition, there are some notes of Ammonius' lectures written by various students which also survive: \n \n *On Aristotle's ''Categories'' (anonymous writer) \n *On Aristotle's ''Prior Analytics I'' (anonymous writer) \n *On Aristotle's ''Metaphysics 1\u20137'' (written by [[Asclepius of Tralles|Asclepius]]) \n *On [[Nicomachus]]' ''Introduction to Arithmetic'' (written by Asclepius) \n *On Aristotle's ''Prior Analytics'' (written by [[John Philoponus]]) \n *On Aristotle's ''Posterior Analytics'' (written by John Philoponus) \n *On Aristotle's ''On Generation and Corruption'' (written by John Philoponus) \n *On Aristotle's ''On the Soul'' (written by John Philoponus) \n \n There is Greek-language work called ''Life of Aristotle'', which is usually ascribed to Ammonius, but  \" is more probable that it is the work of [[Joannes Philoponus]], the pupil of Ammonius, to whom it is ascribed in some [[Manuscript|MSS]]. \" < ref > [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=p5VUAAAAYAAJ & dq= ''The biographical dictionary of the Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge'', Volume 2, Part 2], Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1843, p. 487. < /ref > \n \n ==English translations== \n *''Ammonius: On Aristotle Categories'', translated by S.
