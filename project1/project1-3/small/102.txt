As well as causing the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed, ADEM also attacks the nerves of the central nervous system and damages their myelin insulation, which, as a result, destroys the [[white matter]]. It is often triggered by a [[virus (biology)|viral]] [[infection]] or (very rarely) specific non-routine [[vaccinations]]. < ref > {{cite journal |author =Dale RC |title=Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis |journal=Semin Pediatr Infect Dis |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=90\u20135 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12881796 |doi=10.1053/spid.2003.127225 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author =Garg RK |title=Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis |journal=Postgrad Med J |volume=79 |issue=927 |pages=11\u20137 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12566545 |doi= 10.1136/pmj.79.927.11|pmc=1742586}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author =Jones CT |title=Childhood autoimmune neurologic diseases of the central nervous system |journal=Neurol Clin |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=745\u201364 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14743647 |doi= 10.1016/S0733-8619(03)00007-0}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |vauthors =Huynh W, Cordato DJ, Kehdi E, Masters LT, Dedousis C |title=Post-vaccination encephalomyelitis: literature review and illustrative case |journal=J Clin Neurosci |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1315\u20131322 |date=Dec 2008 |pmid=18976924 |doi=10.1016/j.jocn.2008.05.002 |pmc=7125578 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author =Rust RS |title=Multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and related conditions |journal=Semin Pediatr Neurol |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=66\u201390 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10914409 |doi= 10.1053/pb.2000.6693}} < /ref > < ref name= \" Poser and Brinar 2007 \" > {{cite journal |vauthors =Poser CM, Brinar VV |title=Disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis: two different diseases - a critical review |journal=Acta Neurol.
