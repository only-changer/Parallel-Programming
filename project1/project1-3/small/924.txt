The transition to oil production led to remarkable growth figures as projects came online; reaching 26.4% in 2005 (second highest [[GDP]] growth in the world in 2005 only to [[Equatorial Guinea]]) and 34.6% in 2006 (world highest) before subsiding to 10.8% and 9.3% in 2008 and 2009 respectively. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.today.az/news/business/51114.html|title=Today.Az - GDP growth makes 3.4% in Azerbaijan in 2009|access-date=3 March 2015|archive-date=18 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318085911/http://www.today.az/news/business/51114.html|url-status=dead}} < /ref >   The real GDP growth rate for 2011 was expected at 3.7% but had dropped to 0.1%. < ref name=State > {{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2909.htm|title=Background Note: Azerbaijan|publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |date=23 March 2012}} < /ref > \n Large [[Petroleum|oil]] reserves are a major contributor to [[Azerbaijan]]'s economy. The national currency, the [[Azerbaijani manat]], was stable in 2000, depreciating 3.8% against the dollar. The budget deficit equaled 1.3% of GDP in 2000. \n \n Progress on economic reform has generally lagged behind [[macroeconomic]] stabilization. The government has undertaken regulatory reforms in some areas, including the substantial opening of trade policy, but inefficient public administration in which commercial and regulatory interests are co-mingled limit the impact of these reforms. < ref > {{cite web|title=Azerbaijan on CIA's Worldfactbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/azerbaijan/|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=19 August 2014}} < /ref >  The government has largely completed [[privatization]] of agricultural lands and small and medium-sized enterprises. In August 2000, the government launched a second-stage privatization program, in which many large state enterprises will be privatized. Since 2001, the economic activity in the country is regulated by the [[Ministry of Economy (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Economy of Azerbaijan Republic]]. \n \n ==Economic history of Azerbaijan== \n \n ===Modern era=== \n Throughout the Soviet period, Azerbaijan had always been less developed industrially than Armenia and Georgia, two neighboring Transcaucasia countries{{Snd}} but also less diversified, as a result of slow investment in the non-oil sector. With a history of industrial development of more than 100 years, Azerbaijan proved to be a leading nation in the Southern Caucasus throughout the turmoil of the Soviet Union collapse in the early 1990s until nowadays. \n \n ===Republic era=== \n Oil remains the most prominent product of Azerbaijan's economy with cotton, natural gas and agriculture products contributing to its economic growth over the last five years. More than $60 billion was invested into Azerbaijan's oil by major international oil companies in AIOC consortium operated by [[BP]]. Oil production under the first of these PSAs, with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company, began in November 1997 and now is about 500,000 barrels per day.
