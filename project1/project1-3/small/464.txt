The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in North America during the 17th century, followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries. During the 17th century, dialects from many different regions of England existed in every American colony, allowing a process of [[koineization|extensive dialect mixture]] and [[dialect leveling|leveling]] in which English varieties across the colonies became more homogeneous compared with varieties in England. < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Kretzchmar|2004|pp=258\u20139}} < /ref > < ref > {{harvcoltxt|Longmore|2007|pp=517, 520}} < /ref >  English thus predominated in the colonies even by the end of the 17th century's first massive immigration of non-English speakers from Europe and Africa, and firsthand descriptions of a fairly uniform American English became common after the mid-18th century. < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Longmore|2007|p=537}} < /ref >  Since then, American English has developed into some new varieties, including regional dialects that, in some cases, show minor influences in the last two centuries from successive waves of immigrant speakers of diverse languages, < ref > Hickey, R.

Scotch-Irish settlers spread from Delaware and Pennsylvania throughout the larger Mid-Atlantic region, the inland regions of both the South and North and throughout the West, American dialect areas that a consistently resisted upper-class non-rhotic influences and that consequently remain rhotic today. < ref > Wolfram, Walt; Schilling, Natalie (2015).

The split, which has now reversed in most British English, simultaneously shifts this relatively recent {{sc2|CLOTH}} set into a merger with the {{sc2|THOUGHT}} (''caught'') set. Having taken place prior to the unrounding of the ''cot'' vowel, it results in lengthening and perhaps raising, merging the more recently separated vowel into the {{sc2|THOUGHT}} vowel in the following environments: before many instances of {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}, and particularly {{IPA|/s/}} (as in ''Austria, cloth, cost, loss, off, often,'' etc.), a few instances before {{IPA|/\u014b/}} (as in ''strong, long, wrong''), and variably by region or speaker in ''gone'', ''on'', and certain other words. < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|pp=136\u20137, 203\u20134}} < /ref > \n \n The standard accent of southern England, [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP), has evolved in other ways compared with which General American has remained relatively more conservative. Examples include the modern RP features of a [[trap\u2013bath split|'' trap\u2013bath'' split]] and the fronting of {{IPA|/o\u028a/}}, neither of which is typical of General American accents. Moreover, American dialects do not participate in [[H-dropping]], an innovative feature that now characterizes perhaps a majority of the regional dialects of England. \n \n ===Innovative phonology=== \n However, General American is more innovative than the dialects of England or elsewhere in the world in a number of its own ways: \n * [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Father\u2013bother merger|Unrounded {{Sc2|LOT}}]]: The American phenomenon of the {{Sc2|LOT}} vowel (often spelled {{angbr|o}} in words like ''box, don, clock, notch, pot,'' etc.) being produced without [[rounded vowel|rounded lips]], like the {{Sc2|PALM}} vowel, allows ''father'' and ''bother'' to rhyme, the two vowels now unified as the single [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/\u0251/}}. The ''father\u2013bother'' vowel merger < !--Link already present two sentences prior.-- >  is in a transitional or completed stage in nearly all in North American English. Exceptions are in northeastern [[New England English]], such as the [[Boston accent]], as well as variably in some [[New York accent]]s. < ref name=Wells > {{harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|pp=136\u201337, 203\u20136, 234, 245\u201347, 339\u201340, 400, 419, 443, 576}} < /ref > < !-- Wells 1982: 245\u201347 -- > < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=171}} < /ref > \n *[[cot\u2013caught merger|''Cot\u2013caught'' merger]] in transition: There is no single American way to pronounce the vowels in words like ''cot'' {{IPA|/\u0251/}} (the ''ah'' vowel) versus ''caught'' {{IPA|/\u0254/}} (the ''aw'' vowel), largely because of a merger occurring between the two sounds in some parts of North America, but not others. American speakers with a completed merger pronounce the two historically-separate vowels with the [[Homophone|same sound]] (especially in the [[American West|West]], northern [[New England]], [[West Virginia]], [[western Pennsylvania]], and the [[Upper Midwest]]), but other speakers have no trace of a merger at all (especially in the [[American South|South]], the [[Great Lakes region]], southern [[New England]], and the [[Mid-Atlantic United States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New York metropolitan area]]s) and so pronounce each vowel with distinct sounds {{Pronunciation|Cot-caught distinction.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}.{{sfnp|Labov|2006|p=61}} Among speakers who distinguish between the two, the vowel of ''cot'' (usually transcribed in American English as {{IPA|/\u0251/}}), is often a [[central vowel|central]] {{IPAblink|\u0251\u0308|audio=y}} or advanced [[back vowel|back]] {{IPA|[\u0251\u031f]}}, while {{IPA|/\u0254/}} is pronounced with more rounded lips and/or phonetically higher in the mouth, close to {{IPAblink|\u0252|audio=y}} or {{IPAblink|\u0254|audio=y}}, but with only slight rounding.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=476}} Among speakers who do not distinguish between them, thus producing a ''cot\u2013caught'' merger, {{IPA|/\u0251/}} usually remains a back vowel, {{IPA|[\u0251]}}, sometimes showing lip rounding as {{IPA|[\u0252]}}. Therefore, even mainstream Americans vary greatly with this speech feature, with possibilities ranging from a full merger to no merger at all. A transitional stage of the merger is also common in scatterings throughout the United States, most consistently in the [[Midland American English|American Midlands]] lying between the historical dialect regions of the North and the South, while younger Americans in general tend to be transitioning toward the merger. According to a 2003 dialect survey carried out across the United States, about 61% of participants perceive themselves as keeping the two vowels distinct and 39% do not. < ref > Vaux, Bert; Golder, Scott (2003).  \" [http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/q_28.html Do you pronounce 'cot' and '\u00e7aught' the same?] \"  The Harvard Dialect Survey.

(This innovation of [[T-glottalization|/t/ glottal stopping]] may occur in British English as well and variably between vowels.) \n * [[Flapping]]: {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}} becomes a [[alveolar flap|flap]] {{IPAblink|\u027e|audio=y}} both after a vowel or {{IPA|/r/}} and before an unstressed vowel or a syllabic consonant other than {{IPA|[n\u0329]}}, including ''water'' {{IPA-all|\u02c8w\u0254\u027e\u025a||En-us-water.ogg}}, ''party'' {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u02b0\u0251\u0279\u027ei]}} and ''model'' {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0251\u027e\u026b\u0329]}}. This results in pairs such as ''ladder/latter, metal/medal,'' and ''coating/coding'' being pronounced the same. Flapping of {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}} before a full stressed vowel is also possible but only if that vowel begins a new word or morpheme, as in ''what is it?'' {{IPA|[w\u028c\u027e\u02c8\u026az\u0268\u0294]}} and twice in ''not at all'' {{IPA|[n\u0251\u027e\u0259\u027e\u02c8\u0254\u026b]}}. Other rules apply to flapping to such a complex degree in fact that flapping has been analyzed as being required in certain contexts, prohibited in others, and optional in still others. < ref > Vaux, Bert (2000_.  \" Flapping in English. \"  ''Linguistic Society of America'', Chicago, IL. p .6. < /ref >  For instance, flapping is prohibited in words like ''seduce'' {{IPA|[s\u0268\u02c8dus]}}, ''retail'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0279it\u02b0e\u026a\u026b]}}, and ''monotone'' {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0251n\u0268t\u02b0o\u028an]}}, yet optional in ''impotence'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u026amp\u0268\u027e\u0268ns, \u02c8\u026amp\u0268t\u02b0\u0268ns]}}. \n *Both intervocalic {{IPA|/nt/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} may commonly be realized as {{IPAblink|\u027e\u0303}} (a nasalized [[alveolar flap]]) or simply {{IPA|[n]}}, making ''winter'' and ''winner'' homophones in fast or informal speech. \n * L-velarization: England's typical distinction between a  \" clear L \"  (i.e. {{IPAblink|l|audio=y}}) and a  \" dark L \"  (i.e. {{IPAblink|\u026b|audio=y}}) is much less noticeable in nearly all dialects of American English; < ref > {{cite book|title=Language Talent and Brain Activity: Trends in Applied Linguistics|editor=Grzegorz Dogil |editor2=Susanne Maria Reiterer |editor3=Walter de Gruyter|year=2009|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH|page=299|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfIGxRtdXsQC & pg=PA299|isbn=978-3-11-021549-6}} < /ref >  it is often altogether absent, < ref > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfIGxRtdXsQC & q= \" General+American \" + \" velarized \" & pg=PA299|title=Language Talent and Brain Activity: Trends in Applied Linguistics|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH|year=2009|isbn=9783110215496 |editor=Grzegorz Dogil |editor2=Susanne Maria Reiterer |editor3=Walter de Gruyter|page=299}} < /ref >  with all  \" L \"  sounds tending to be  \" dark, \"  meaning having some degree of [[velarization]], < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|p=490}} < /ref >  perhaps even as dark as {{IPAblink|\u029f|audio=y}} (though in initial position, perhaps less dark than elsewhere among some speakers).{{sfnp|Jones|Roach|Hartman|2006|p=xi}} The only notable exceptions to this velarization are in some Spanish-influenced American English varieties (such as [[New York Latino English|East Coast Latino English]], which typically shows a clear  \" L \"  in [[syllable onset]]s) and in [[older Southern American English|older, moribund Southern speech]], where  \" L \"  is clear in an [[intervocalic consonant|intervocalic]] environment between [[front vowel]]s. < ref > ''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann  &  Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 319. < /ref > \n * [[Phonological history of English high front vowels#Weak-vowel merger|Weak-vowel merger]]: The vowel {{IPA|/\u026a/}} in unstressed syllables generally merges with {{IPA|/\u0259/}} and so ''effect'' is pronounced like ''affect'', and ''abbot'' and ''rabbit'' rhyme. The quality of the merged vowels varies considerably but is typically closer to  [\u0259] in word-initial or word-final position, and closer to [\u026a~\u0268] elsewhere.{{sfnp|Wells|2008|p=xxi}} \n * Raising of pre-voiceless {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}: Many speakers split the sound {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} based on whether it occurs before a voiceless consonant and so in ''rider'', it is pronounced {{IPA|[\u00e4\u026a]}}, but in ''writer'', it is raised to {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} (because {{IPA|[t]}} is a voiceless consonant while {{IPA|[d]}} is not). Thus, words like ''bright, hike, price, wipe,'' etc. with a following voiceless consonant (such as {{IPA|/t, k, \u03b8, s/}}) use a more raised vowel sound compared to ''bride, high, prize, wide'', etc. Because of this sound change, the words ''rider'' and ''writer'' {{Pronunciation|En-us-rider-writer.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}, for instance, remain distinct from one another by virtue of their difference in height (and length) of the diphthong's starting point (unrelated to both the letters ''d'' and ''t'' being pronounced in these words as alveolar flaps {{IPA|[\u027e]}}). The sound-change also applies across word boundaries, though the position of a word or phrase's stress may prevent the raising from taking place. For instance, a ''high school'' in the sense of  \" secondary school \"  is generally pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u0250\u026asku\u026b]}}; however, a ''high school'' in the literal sense of  \" a tall school \"  would be pronounced {{IPA|[\u02ccha\u026a\u02c8sku\u026b]}}. The [[sound change]] began in the [[Northern American English|Northern]], [[New England English|New England]], and [[Mid-Atlantic American English|Mid-Atlantic]] regions of the country, < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=114}}:  \" where Canadian raising has traditionally been reported: Canada, Eastern New England, Philadelphia, and the North \" < /ref >  and is becoming more common across the nation. \n *Many speakers in the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]], [[North Central American English|Upper Midwestern]], and [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia dialect areas]] raise {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} before voiced consonants in certain words as well, particularly {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[g]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}. Hence, words like ''tiny'', ''spider'', ''cider'', ''tiger'', ''dinosaur'', ''beside'', ''idle'' (but sometimes not ''idol''), and ''fire'' may contain a raised nucleus. The use of {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}}, rather than {{IPA|[a\u026a]}}, in such words is unpredictable from phonetic environment alone, but it may have to do with their acoustic similarity to other words that with {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} before a voiceless consonant, per the traditional Canadian-raising system. Some researchers have argued that there has been a [[phonemic split]] in those dialects, and the distribution of the two sounds is becoming more unpredictable among younger speakers. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1087 & context=curej|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|title=The Spread of Raising: Opacity, lexicalization, and diffusion|date=November 11, 2007|access-date=September 21, 2016|last=Freuhwald|first=Josef T.}} < /ref > \n * Conditioned [[/\u00e6/ raising]] (especially before {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}): The raising of the {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} or {{sc2|TRAP}} vowel occurs in specific environments that vary widely from region to region but most commonly before {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}. With most American speakers for whom the phoneme {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} operates under a somewhat-continuous system, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} has both a tense and a lax [[allophone]] (with a kind of  \" continuum \"  of possible sounds between both extremes, rather than a definitive split). In those accents, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} is overall realized before [[nasal stop]]s as more tense (approximately {{IPA|[e\u0259\u032f]}}), while other environments are more lax (approximately the standard {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}); for example, note the vowel sound in {{IPA|[m\u00e6s]}} for ''mass'', but {{IPA|[me\u0259\u032fn]}} for ''man''). In some American accents, however, specifically those from [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]], {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} and {{IPA|[e\u0259\u032f]}} are indeed entirely-separate (or  \" split \" ) phonemes, for example, in ''planet'' {{IPA|[p\u02b0l\u00e6n\u0268\u0294]}} vs. ''plan it'' {{IPA|[p\u02b0le\u0259n\u0268\u0294]}}. They are called Mid-Atlantic [[/\u00e6/#Phonemic tensing|split-''a'']] systems. The vowels move in the opposite direction (high and forward) in the mouth compared to the backed Standard British  \" [[broad a|broad ''a'']] \" , but both ''a'' systems are probably related phonologically, if not phonetically, since a British-like phenomenon occurs among some older speakers of the eastern New England (Boston) area for whom {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} changes to {{IPA|/a/}} before {{IPA|/f/, /s/, /\u03b8/, /\u00f0/, /z/, /v/}} alone or when preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal. \n {{/\u00e6/ raising in North American English}} \n * [[Mergers of /\u0252r-/ and /\u0254\u02d0r-/| \" Short ''o'' \"  before ''r'' before a vowel]]: In typical North American accents (both U.S. and Canada), the historical sequence {{IPA|/\u0252r/}} (a short ''o'' sound followed by ''r'' and then another vowel, as in ''orange'', ''forest'', ''moral'', and ''warrant'') is realized as {{IPA|[o\u0279~\u0254\u0279]}}, thus further merging with the already-merged {{IPA|/\u0254r/\u2013/o\u028ar/}} ([[horse\u2013hoarse merger|''horse''\u2013''hoarse'']]) set. In the U.S., four words (''tom{{under|orr}}ow, s{{under|orr}}y, s{{under|orr}}ow, b{{under|orr}}ow,'' and ''m{{under|orr}}ow'') usually contain the sound {{IPA|[\u0251\u0279]}} instead and thus merge with the {{IPA|/\u0251r/}} set (thus, ''sorry'' and ''[[sari]]'' become [[homophone]]s, both rhyming with ''starry'').{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=476}} \n {{English -or- table|header=General American {{IPA|/\u0251r/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254r/}} followed by a vowel, compared with other dialects|hidden=yes}} \n Some mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include the following: \n * [[Horse\u2013hoarse merger|''Horse\u2013hoarse'' merger]]: This merger makes the vowels {{IPA|/\u0254/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} homophones, with homophonous pairs like ''horse/hoarse, corps/core, for/four, morning/mourning, war/wore,'' etc. [[homophone]]s.

Terms such as ''[[autumn|fall]]'' ( \" autumn \" ), ''[[faucet]]'' ( \" tap \" ), ''[[diaper]]'' ( \" nappy \" ; itself unused in the U.S.), ''[[candy]]'' ( \" sweets \" ), ''[[Frying pan|skillet]]'', ''[[eyeglasses]]'', and ''[[obligate]]'' are often regarded as Americanisms.

The first large American dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language'', known as [[Webster's Dictionary]], was written by [[Noah Webster]] in 1828, codifying several of these spellings. \n \n Differences in grammar are relatively minor, and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility; these include: typically a lack of differentiation between adjectives and adverbs, employing the equivalent adjectives as adverbs ''he ran quick''/''he ran quickly''; different use of some [[auxiliary verb]]s; formal (rather than notional) agreement with [[collective noun]]s; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: ''learned''/''learnt'', ''burned''/''burnt'', ''snuck/sneaked'', ''dove/dived'') although the purportedly  \" British \"  forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE ''in school,'' BrE ''at school'' < !--when it means  \" to be a student \" -- > ); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE ''to the hospital'', BrE ''to hospital''; contrast, however, AmE ''actress Elizabeth Taylor'', BrE ''the actress Elizabeth Taylor''). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other, < ref > Algeo, John (2006). ''British or American English?''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-37993-8}}. < /ref >  and American English is not a standardized set of dialects. \n \n Differences in [[orthography]] are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as ''flavor'' for British ''flavour'', ''fiber'' for ''fibre'', ''defense'' for ''defence'', ''analyze'' for ''analyse'', ''license'' for ''licence'', ''catalog'' for ''catalogue'' and ''traveling'' for ''travelling''. [[Noah Webster]] popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather,  \" he chose already existing options on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology. \" < ref > Algeo, John.  \" The Effects of the Revolution on Language, \"  in ''A Companion to the American Revolution''. John Wiley  &  Sons, 2008. p.599 < /ref >  Other differences are due to the [[francophile]] tastes of the 19th century [[Victorian era]] Britain (for example they preferred ''programme'' for ''program'', ''manoeuvre'' for ''maneuver'', ''cheque'' for ''check'', etc.). < ref > Peters, Pam (2004). ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-62181-X}}, pp. 34 and 511. < /ref >  AmE almost always uses ''-ize'' in words like ''realize''. BrE prefers ''-ise'', but also uses ''-ize'' on occasion (see [[Oxford spelling]]). \n \n There are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of [[run-on sentences]], called  \" [[comma splice]]s \"  in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark ( \" like this \" ) over single ('as here'). < ref name= \" APA \" > {{cite web \n |url= http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html \n |author= < !--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-- > \n |title=Punctuating Around Quotation Marks \n |publisher=Style Guide of the American Psychological Association \n |year=2011 \n |format=blog \n |access-date=2015-03-21}} < /ref > \n \n Vocabulary differences vary by region. For example, ''autumn'' is used more commonly in the United Kingdom, whereas ''fall'' is more common in American English. Some other differences include: aerial (United Kingdom) vs. antenna, biscuit (United Kingdom) vs. cookie/cracker, car park (United Kingdom) vs. parking lot, caravan (United Kingdom) vs. trailer, city centre (United Kingdom) vs. downtown, flat (United Kingdom) vs. apartment, fringe (United Kingdom) vs. bangs, and holiday (United Kingdom) vs. vacation. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.studyenglishtoday.net/british-american-english.html|title=British vs. American English \u2013 Vocabulary Differences|website=www.studyenglishtoday.net|access-date=2019-04-18}} < /ref > \n \n AmE sometimes favors words that are [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE ''transportation'' and BrE ''transport'' or where the British form is a [[back-formation]], such as AmE ''burglarize'' and BrE ''burgle'' (from ''burglar''). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems. \n \n ==Varieties==  < !-- This section is linked from [[Huckleberry Hound]] -- > \n {{Side box|above={{Map of American English}}|text=The map above shows the major regional dialects of American English (in [[all caps]]) plus smaller and more local dialects, as demarcated primarily by Labov et al.'s ''[[The Atlas of North American English]]'', < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=148}} < /ref >  as well as the related Telsur Project's [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/home.html#regional regional maps].

As of the 20th century, the middle and eastern [[Great Lakes area]], Chicago being the largest city with these speakers, also ushered in certain unique features, including the [[fronting (phonetics)|front]]ing of the {{sc2|LOT}} {{IPA|/\u0251/}} vowel in the mouth toward {{IPA|[a]}} and [[tenseness|tensing]] of the {{sc2|TRAP}} {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} vowel wholesale to {{IPA|[e\u0259]}}.

Non-rhoticity among such speakers is presumed to have arisen from their upper classes' close historical contact with [[England]], imitating London's ''r''-dropping, a feature that has continued to gain prestige throughout England from the late 18th century onwards, < ref > {{harvcoltxt|Trudgill|2004|pp=46\u201347}} < /ref >  but which has conversely lost prestige in the U.S. since at least the early 20th century. < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=5, 47}} < /ref >  Non-rhoticity makes a word like ''car'' sound like ''cah'' or ''source'' like ''sauce''. < ref name= \" Labov 2006 137, 141 \" > {{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=137, 141}} < /ref > \n \n New York City and [[Southern American English|Southern accents]] are the most prominent regional accents of the country, as well as the most stigmatized in terms of [[perceptual dialectology|perceived]]  \" incorrectness \" . < ref > Hayes, Dean (2013).  \" [http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/ling_etds/15 The Southern Accent and 'Bad English': A Comparative Perceptual Study of the Conceptual Network between Southern Linguistic Features and Identity] \" .

Rather than one particular accent, General American is best defined as an umbrella covering an American accent that does not incorporate features associated with some particular region, ethnicity, or socioeconomic group. Typical General American features include [[rhoticity in English|rhotic]]ity, the [[father\u2013bother merger|''father\u2013bother'' merger]], [[Mary\u2013marry\u2013merry merger|''Mary\u2013marry\u2013merry'' merger]], [[/\u00e6/ tensing|pre-nasal  \" short ''a'' \"  tensing]], and other [[General American#Phonology|particular vowel sounds]].{{efn|name=fn3}} General American features are embraced most by Americans who are highly educated or in the most formal contexts, and regional accents with the most General American native features include North Midland, Western New England, and Western accents. \n \n ===Other varieties=== \n Although no longer region-specific, < ref > Cf. {{harvnb|Trudgill|2004|p=42}}. < /ref >  [[African-American Vernacular English]], which remains the native variety of most working- and middle-class [[African Americans]], has a close relationship to Southern dialects and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans, including [[hip hop culture]]. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have also developed native-speaker varieties of English. The best-studied Latino Englishes are [[Chicano English]], spoken in the West and Midwest, and [[New York Latino English]], spoken in the [[New York metropolitan area]]. Additionally, ethnic varieties such as [[Yeshivish|Yeshiva English]] and  \" [[Yinglish]] \"  are spoken by some [[American Jews|American]] [[Orthodox Jew]]s, [[Cajun English|Cajun Vernacular English]] by some [[Cajun]]s in southern Louisiana, and [[Pennsylvania Dutch English]] by some [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] people. [[American Indian English]]es have been documented among diverse Indian tribes. The island state of [[Hawaii]], though primarily English-speaking, is also home to a [[creole language]] known commonly as [[Hawaiian Pidgin]], and some Hawaii residents speak English with a Pidgin-influenced accent. American English also gave rise to some dialects outside the country, for example, [[Philippine English]], beginning during the [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|American occupation of the Philippines]] and subsequently the [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands]]; [[Thomasites]] first established a variation of American English in these islands. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Dayag|first=Danilo|date=2004|title=The English\u2010language media in the Philippines|journal=World Englishes|volume=23|pages=33\u201345|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-English%E2%80%90language-media-in-the-Philippines-Dayag/25eac1a40823223ef5de8c6b0b8d6b7ddd023cf0|doi=10.1111/J.1467-971X.2004.00333.X|s2cid=145589555}} < /ref > \n \n ==See also== \n {{Portal|United States|Language}} \n * [[Dictionary of American Regional English]] \n * [[List of English words from indigenous languages of the Americas]] \n * [[International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects]] \n * [[Help:IPA/English|International Phonetic Alphabet chart for the English Language]] \n * [[Phonological history of English]] \n * [[Regional accents of English]] \n * [[Canadian English]] \n * [[North American English]] \n * [[International English]] \n * [[Received Pronunciation]] \n * [[Mid-Atlantic accent|Transatlantic accent]] \n * [[American and British English spelling differences]] \n \n ==Notes== \n {{notelist|refs= \n {{efn|name=fn1|English and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] are both official languages in [[Hawaii]], and English and [[Alaska Native languages|20 Indigenous languages]] are official in [[Alaska]].
