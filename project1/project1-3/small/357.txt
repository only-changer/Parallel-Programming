After the [[Punic Wars]], the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] eventually took over administration of the town, which they called [[Icosium]]. Its ruins now form part of the modern city's marine quarter, with the Rue de la Marine following a former [[Roman road]]. Roman cemeteries existed near ''[[Bab-el-Oued]]'' and ''[[Bab Azoun]]''. The city was given [[Latin citizenship|Latin rights]] by the emperor [[Vespasian]].

He had earlier (935) built his own house and a [[Sanhaja]] center at Ashir, just south of Algiers.  Although his Zirid dynasty was overthrown by [[Roger II of Sicily]] in 1148, the Zirids had already lost control of Algiers to their cousins the [[Hammadid]]s in 1014. < ref > Ruedy, John Douglas (2005) ''Modern Algeria: The origins and development of a nation'' Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Indiana [https://books.google.com/books?id=WIRWgrbE_fEC & pg=PA13 page 13] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517220646/https://books.google.com/books?id=WIRWgrbE_fEC & pg=PA13 |date=2016-05-17 }}, {{ISBN|978-0-253-21782-0}} < /ref >  The city was wrested from the Hammadids by the [[Almohads]] in 1159, and in the 13th century came under the dominion of the [[Ziyanid]] sultans of [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Tlemcen]]. Nominally part of the sultanate of Tlemcen, Algiers had a large measure of independence under [[Thaaliba]] [[amir]]s of its own due to [[Oran]] being the chief seaport of the Ziyanids.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=655}} \n \n The [[Pe\u00f1\u00f3n of Algiers]], an islet in front of Algiers harbour had been occupied by the Spaniards as early as 1302. Thereafter, a considerable amount of trade began to flow between Algiers and [[Spain]]. However, Algiers continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the [[Reconquista#Conversions and expulsions|expulsion of the Moors]] from Spain, many of whom sought asylum in the city. In 1510, following their occupation of Oran and other towns on the coast of Africa, the Spaniards fortified the islet of Pe\u00f1on{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=655}} and imposed a levy intended to suppress [[Barbary corsairs|corsair]] activity. < ref > Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, p. 13. < /ref > \n \n ===[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule=== \n [[File:Civitates orbis terrarum.

Aruj came to Algiers, ordered the assassination of Selim, and seized the town and ousted the Spanish in the [[Capture of Algiers (1516)]]. Hayreddin, succeeding Aruj after the latter was killed in battle against the Spaniards in the [[Fall of Tlemcen (1517)]], was the founder of the ''[[pashaluk]]'', which subsequently became the ''[[bey]]lik'', of Algeria. Barbarossa lost Algiers in 1524 but regained it with the [[Capture of Algiers (1529)]], and then formally invited the Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] to accept sovereignty over the territory and to annex Algiers to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. \n \n [[File:Algiers and Bejaia by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Historic map of Algiers by [[Piri Reis]]]] \n {{Anchor|Algerine}} < !-- common name for inhabitants of the area at this time  \" Algerine \"  redirect here do not remove-- > \n Algiers from this time became the chief seat of the [[Barbary pirates]].

Due to its location on the periphery of both the Ottoman and European economic spheres, and depending for its existence on a Mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by European shipping, backed by European navies, piracy became the primary economic activity. Repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western Mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as Iceland. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.heimaslod.is/index.php/Tyrkjar%C3%A1ni%C3%B0 |title=Tyrkjar\u00e1ni\u00f0 \u2013 Heimasl\u00f3\u00f0 |language=is |publisher=Heimaslod.is |access-date=2010-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527072348/http://www.heimaslod.is/index.php/Tyrkjar%C3%A1ni%C3%B0 |archive-date=2011-05-27 |url-status=live }} < /ref >  The [[United States]] fought two wars (the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]]s) over Algiers' attacks on shipping. \n \n Among the notable people held for ransom was the future Spanish novelist [[Miguel de Cervantes]], who was captive in Algiers almost five years, and who wrote two plays set in Algiers of the period.

In this wall, five gates allowed access to the city, with five roads from each gate dividing the city and meeting in front of the Ketchaoua Mosque. In 1556, a citadel was constructed at the highest point in the wall. A major road running north to south divided the city in two: The upper city (al-Gabal, or 'the mountain') which consisted of about fifty small quarters of [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]], [[Algerian Jews|Jewish]], [[Moors|Moorish]] and [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] communities, and the lower city (al-Wata, or 'the plains') which was the administrative, military and commercial centre of the city, mostly inhabited by [[Kouloughlis|Ottoman Turkish dignitaries]] and other upper-class families. < ref > Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, pp. 13\u201314. < /ref > \n \n In August 1816, the city was bombarded by a British squadron under [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]] (a descendant of Thomas Pellew, taken in an Algerian slave raid in 1715 < ref > {{Cite book|title=Africa (a-z).|last=Godfrey.|first=Mugoti|date=2009|publisher=Lulu Com|isbn=978-1435728905|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=946180025}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}} < /ref > {{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}), assisted by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] men-of-war, destroying the corsair fleet harboured in Algiers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=655}} \n \n ===French rule=== \n [[File:Algiers - depot and station grounds of Algerian Railway LCCN2004707260.tif|thumb|Algiers depot and station grounds of Algerian Railway, 1894]] \n The history of Algiers from 1830 to 1962 is bound to the larger history of [[Algeria]] and its relationship to [[France]].

Harvard University Press. p.323. {{ISBN|0-674-01017-5}} < /ref >  During the 1930s, the architect [[Le Corbusier]] drew up plans for a complete redesign of the colonial city. Le Corbusier was highly critical of the urban style of Algiers, describing the European district as  \" nothing but crumbling walls and devastated nature, the whole a sullied blot \" . He also criticised the difference in living standards he perceived between the European and African residents of the city, describing a situation in which  \" the 'civilised' live like rats in holes \"  whereas  \" the 'barbarians' live in solitude, in well-being \" . < ref > Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, p. 5. < /ref >  However, these plans were ultimately ignored by the French administration. \n \n During [[World War II]], Algiers was the first city to be seized from the Axis by the Allies during [[Operation Torch]]. \n [[File:Algiers CNE-v1-p58-J.jpg|thumb|left|City and harbour of Algiers, {{circa|1921}}]] \n \n In 1962, after a bloody independence struggle in which hundreds of thousands (estimates range between 350,000 and 1,500,000) died (mostly Algerians but also French and [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]]) during fighting between the [[French Army]] and the Algerian [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale]], Algeria gained its independence, with Algiers as its capital. Since then, despite losing its entire ''[[pied-noir]]'' population, the city has expanded massively. It now has about five million inhabitants, or 10 percent of Algeria's population\u2014and its suburbs now cover most of the surrounding [[Geography of Algeria|Mitidja]] plain. \n \n ===Algerian War=== \n [[File:1962-03-22 Algeria tense cease fire.ogv|thumb|right|The  \" tense truce \"  between Algerian rebels, French army and the OAS in 1962]] \n Algiers also played a pivotal role in the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u20131962), particularly during the [[Algerian War#Battle of Algiers|Battle of Algiers]] when the 10th Parachute Division of the French Army, starting on January 7, 1957, and on the orders of the French Minister of Justice [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] (who authorized any means  \" to eliminate the insurrectionists \" {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}), led attacks against the Algerian fighters for independence. Algiers remains marked by this battle, which was characterized by merciless fighting between FLN forces which carried out a guerrilla campaign against the French military and police and pro-French Algerian soldiers, and the French Army which responded with a bloody repression, torture and blanket terrorism against the native population. The demonstrations of May 13 during the crisis of 1958 provoked the fall of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in France, as well as the return of General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] to power. \n \n ===Independence=== \n Algeria achieved [[independence]] on July 5, 1962. Run by the FLN that had secured independence, Algiers became a member of [[Non-Aligned Movement]] during the [[Cold War]]. In October 1988, one year before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], Algiers was the site of demonstrations demanding the end of the single-party system and the creation of a ''real'' [[democracy]] baptized the  \" Spring of Algier \" . The demonstrators were repressed by the authorities (more than 300 dead), but the movement constituted a turning point in the political history of modern Algeria. In 1989, a new constitution was adopted that put an end to the one-party rule and saw the creation of more than fifty political parties, as well as official freedom of the press. \n \n ===Crisis of the 1990s=== \n The city became the theatre of many political demonstrations of all descriptions until 1993. In 1991, a political entity dominated by religious conservatives called the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] engaged in a political test of wills with the authorities. In the 1992 elections for the Algerian National Assembly, the Islamists garnered a large amount of support in the first round. Fearing an eventual win by the Islamists, the army canceled the election process, setting off a [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]] between the State and armed religious conservatives which would last for a decade. \n \n On December 11, 2007, two car [[11 December 2007 Algiers bombings|bombs exploded in Algiers]]. One bomb targeted two [[United Nations]] office buildings and the other targeted a government building housing the Supreme Court. The death toll was at least 62, with over two hundred injured in the attacks. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Les autorit\u00e9s accusent al-Qa\u00efda|publisher=RFI|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/096/article_60149.asp|access-date=2007-12-11| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071213023440/http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/096/article_60149.asp| archive-date= 13 December 2007 | url-status= live}} < /ref >  However, only 26 remained hospitalized the following day. < ref > {{Cite news|title=Toll in Algiers bombings rises to 31 |agency=Associated Press |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071212/ap_on_re_af/algeria_explosion |access-date=2007-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214021257/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071212/ap_on_re_af/algeria_explosion |archive-date=2007-12-14 |url-status=live }} < /ref >  {{as of|2008}}, it is speculated that the attack was carried out by the Al Qaida cell within the city. < ref > {{cite news|title=Al Qaeda blamed for Algeria bombs|publisher=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/12/11/algeria.blast/index.html|access-date=2007-12-11 | date=2007-12-12| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071212153122/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/12/11/algeria.blast/index.html| archive-date= 12 December 2007 | url-status= live}} < /ref > \n \n Indigenous terrorist groups have been actively [[Islamic insurgency in Algeria (2002\u2013present)#2007|operating in Algeria since around 2002]]. \n \n ==Geography== \n \n ===Districts of Algiers=== \n [[File:NOTRE DAME D'AFRIQUE.ALGER.jpg|thumb|[[Notre Dame d'Afrique]], built by European settlers in 1872 < ref > {{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8766/ |title = Notre Dame d'Afrique and Carmelite Convent, Algiers, Algeria |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1899 |access-date = 2013-09-25 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130927125818/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8766/ |archive-date = 2013-09-27 |url-status = live }} < /ref > ]] \n * '''[[Casbah of Algiers|The Casbah]]''' (of '' Al Qasbah'',  \" the Citadel \" ), Ier District of Algiers: called '' Al-Djaza\u00efr Al Mahroussa '' (\u201cWell Kept Algiers\u201d), it is founded on the ruins of old Icosium. It is a small city which, built on a hill, goes down towards the sea, divided in two: the High city and the Low city. One finds there masonries and mosques of the 17th century; Ketchaoua mosque (built in 1794 by the Dey Baba Hassan) flanked by two minarets, mosque el Djedid (built in 1660, at the time of Turkish regency) with its large finished ovoid cupola points some and its four coupolettes, mosque El K\u00e9bir (oldest of the mosques, it was built by [[Almoravid]] [[Youssef Ibn Tachfin]] and rebuilt later in 1794), mosque Ali Betchnin (Ra\u00efs, 1623), Dar Aziza, palate of J\u00e9nina. In the Kasbah, there are also labyrinths of lanes and houses that are very picturesque, and if one gets lost there, it is enough to go down again towards the sea to reposition oneself. \n * ''' [[Bab El Oued]]''': Literally ''the River's Gate'', the popular district which extends from the Casbah beyond  \" the gate of the river \" . It is the capital's darling and best liked borough. Famous for its square with  \" the three clocks \"  and for its  \" market Triplet \" , it is also a district of workshops and manufacturing plants. \n * ''' [[Edge of sea]]''': from 1840, the architects Pierre-August Guiauchain and [[Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chass\u00e9riau]] designed new buildings apart from the Casbah, town hall, law courts, buildings, theatre, palace of the Governor, and casino, to form an elegant walk bordered by arcades which is today the boulevard [[Che Guevara]] (formerly the Boulevard of the [[Republic]]). \n * ''' [[Kouba, Algeria|Kouba]]''' ([[will daira]] of [[Hussein-dey]]): Kouba is an old village which was absorbed by the expansion of the town of Algiers. Kouba quickly developed under the French colonial era then continued growing due to formidable demographic expansion that Algiers saw after the independence of Algeria in 1962. It is today a district of Algiers which is largely made up of houses, villas and buildings not exceeding five stories. \n * [[El Harrach]], a suburb of Algiers, is located about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} to the east of the city. \n * The communes of [[Hydra (Algiers) will|Hydra]], [[Ben Aknoun]], [[El-Biar]] and [[Bouzareah]] form what the inhabitants of Algiers call the  \" Heights of Algiers \" . These communes shelter the majority of the foreign embassies of Algiers, of many ministries and university centers, which makes it one of the administrative and policy centers of the country. \n * The  '''Didouche Mourad street''' is located in the 3rd district Of Algiers. It extends from the '''Grande Post office''' to the Heights of Algiers. It crosses in particular the '''place Audin''', '''the [[Algiers 1 University|Faculty of Algiers]]''', '''The Crowned Heart''' and '''the Freedom Park (formerly Galland'''). It is bordered by smart stores and restaurants along most of its length. It is regarded as the heart of the capital. \n [[File:Algiers, Algeria.jpg|thumb|Astronautical view of Algiers]] \n \n ===Climate=== \n Algiers has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa''). Its proximity to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] aids in moderating the city's temperatures. As a result, Algiers usually does not see the extreme temperatures that are experienced in the adjacent interior. Algiers on average receives roughly {{convert|600|mm|in|0}} of rain per year, the bulk of which is seen between October and April. The precipitation is higher than in most of coastal Mediterranean [[Spain]], and similar to most of coastal Mediterranean [[France]], as opposed to the interior North African semi-arid or arid climate. \n \n Snow is very rare; in 2012, the city received {{convert|100|mm|in|0}} of snowfall, its first snowfall in eight years. < ref > {{cite news |title=European Chill Moves West, 122 Die in
