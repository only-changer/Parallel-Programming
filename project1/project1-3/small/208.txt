It is the originating [[firearm]] of the [[Kalashnikov rifle]] (or  \" AK \" ) family. The number ''47'' refers to the year it was finished. \n \n Design work on the AK-47 began in 1945. It was presented for official military trials the following year, and in 1948 the fixed-[[Stock (gun)|stock]] version was introduced into active service with selected units of the [[Soviet Army]]. An early development of the design was the AK''S'' (''Skladnoy'', or 'folding'), which was equipped with an underfolding metal shoulder stock. In early 1949, the AK was officially accepted by the [[Soviet Armed Forces]]{{sfnm|Monetchikov|2005|1p=67|Bolotin|1995|2p=129}} and used by the majority of the member states of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. \n \n Even after more than seven decades, the model and its variants remain the most popular and widely used rifles in the world because of their reliability under harsh conditions, low production cost compared to contemporary Western weapons, availability in virtually every geographic region, and ease of use. The AK has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as [[irregular military|irregular forces]] and [[insurgencies]] worldwide. The model was the basis for developing many other types of individual, crew-served and specialised firearms. {{as of|2004}},  \" [o]f the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov family, three-quarters of which are AK-47s \" . < ref name= \" k3 \"  / > \n \n == History == \n === Origins === \n During [[World War II]], the [[StG 44|Sturmgewehr 44]] [[rifle]] used by [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces made a deep impression on their Soviet counterparts. < ref name= \" Hallock \"  / > < ref name= \" Gun Book Review \"  / >  The select-fire rifle was chambered for a new [[intermediate cartridge]], the [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]], and combined the firepower of a [[submachine gun]] with the range and accuracy of a rifle. < ref name= \" Machine Carbine Promoted \"  / > {{sfn|Rottman|2011|p=9}} On 15 July 1943, an earlier model of the Sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the [[People's Commissariat of Arms of the USSR]]. < ref name= \" english.pravda.ru \"  / >  The Soviets were impressed with the weapon and immediately set about developing an intermediate caliber fully automatic rifle of their own, < ref name= \" Hallock \"  / > < ref name= \" Gun Book Review \"  / >  to replace the [[PPSh-41]] submachine guns and outdated [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] bolt-action rifles that armed most of the Soviet Army. < ref name= \" Field  & amp; Stream \"  / > \n \n The Soviets soon developed the [[7.62\u00d739mm|7.62\u00d739mm M43 cartridge]], < ref name= \" english.pravda.ru \"  / >  the semi-automatic [[SKS|SKS carbine]] and the [[RPD machine gun|RPD light machine gun]]. < ref name= \" virginia1774.org \"  / >  Shortly after World War II, the Soviets developed the AK-47 rifle, which would quickly replace the SKS in Soviet service. < ref name= \" nickpatonwalsh \"  / > < ref name= \" Rossiyskaya Gazeta \"  / >  Introduced in 1959, the [[AKM]] is a lighter stamped steel version and the most ubiquitous variant of the entire AK series of firearms.

Kalashnikov himself observed:  \" A lot of Russian Army soldiers ask me how one can become a constructor, and how new weaponry is designed. These are very difficult questions. Each designer seems to have his own paths, his own successes and failures. But one thing is clear: before attempting to create something new, it is vital to have a good appreciation of everything that already exists in this field. I myself have had many experiences confirming this to be so. \" {{sfn|Bolotin|1995|pp=123\u2013124}} \n \n There are claims about Kalashnikov copying other designs, like [[TKB-415|Bulkin's TKB-415]] < ref name= \" Popenker \"  / >  or [[AVS-36|Simonov's AVS-31]]. < ref name= \" Kuptsov \"  / > \n \n === Early designs === \n Kalashnikov started work on a submachine gun design in 1942{{sfn|Bolotin|1995|p=123}} and with a light machine gun in 1943.{{sfn|Monetchikov|2005|p=38}} < ref name= \" Bolotin p150 \"  / >   \" Early in 1944, Kalashnikov was given some 7.62\u00d739mm M43 cartridges and informed that there were several designers working on weapons for this new Soviet small-arms cartridge.

At first, Kalashnikov was reluctant, given that their rifle had already fared better than its competitors. Eventually, however, Zaitsev managed to persuade Kalashnikov. \n \n In November 1947, the new prototypes (AK-47s) were completed. It used a long-stroke gas piston above the barrel. The upper and lower receivers were combined into a single receiver. The selector and safety were combined into a single control-lever/dust-cover on the right side of the rifle. And, the bolt-handle was simply attached to the bolt-carrier. This simplified the design and production of the rifle. The first army trial series began in early 1948.{{sfn|Monetchikov|2005|p=64}} The new rifle proved to be reliable under a wide range of conditions with convenient handling characteristics. In 1949, it was adopted by the Soviet Army as  \" 7.62 & nbsp;mm Kalashnikov  rifle (AK) \" .{{sfnm|Monetchikov|2005|1p=67|Bolotin|1995|2p=129}} \n \n === Further development === \n [[File:AKMS and AK-47 DD-ST-85-01270.jpg|thumb|AKMS with a stamped Type 4B receiver (top) and an AK-47 with a milled Type 2A receiver]] \n \n There were many difficulties during the initial phase of production. The first production models had [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamped]] sheet metal receivers with a [[Milling (machining)|milled]] [[trunnion]] and butt stock insert, and a stamped body. Difficulties were encountered in welding the guide and ejector rails, causing high rejection rates.{{sfn|Poyer|2006|pp=8\u201311}} Instead of halting production, a heavy < ref group=N > 2.6 lb milled from 6 lb stock. This was about 2.2 lb heavier than the stamped receiver. < /ref >  machined receiver was substituted for the sheet metal receiver. Even though production of these milled rifles started in 1951, they were officially referred to as AK-49, based on the date their development started, but they are much widely known in the collectors' and current commercial market as  \" Type 2 AK-47 \" . < ref name= \" e36 \"  / > < ref name= \" ForgottenWeapons.com \"  / >  This was a more costly process, but the use of machined receivers accelerated production as tooling and labor for the earlier [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] rifle's machined receiver were easily adapted. < ref name= \" browningmgs.com \"  / >  Partly because of these problems, the Soviets were not able to distribute large numbers of the new rifle to soldiers until 1956. During this time, production of the interim SKS rifle continued.{{sfn|Poyer|2006|pp=8\u201311}} \n \n Once the manufacturing difficulties of non-milled receivers had been overcome, a redesigned version designated the AKM (M for  \" modernized \"  or  \" upgraded \" ; in Russian: ''\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442 \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u041c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 [Avtomat Kalashnikova Modernizirovanniy])'' was introduced in 1959. < ref name= \" e36 \"  / >  This new model used a stamped sheet metal receiver and featured a slanted [[muzzle brake]] on the end of the [[gun barrel|barrel]] to compensate for [[muzzle rise]] under recoil. In addition, a hammer retarder was added to prevent the weapon from firing out of battery (without the bolt being fully closed), during rapid or fully automatic fire.{{sfn|Poyer|2006|pp=8\u201311}} This is also sometimes referred to as a  \" cyclic rate reducer \" , or simply  \" rate reducer \" , as it also has the effect of reducing the number of rounds fired per minute during fully automatic fire.

Overall, the most-used design in the construction of the AK-series rifles. \n |} \n \n Both licensed and unlicensed production of the Kalashnikov weapons abroad were almost exclusively of the AKM variant, partially due to the much easier production of the stamped receiver. This model is the most commonly encountered, having been produced in much greater quantities. All rifles based on the Kalashnikov design are frequently referred to as AK-47s in the West, although this is only correct when applied to rifles based on the original three receiver types.{{sfn|Poyer|2006|p=2}} In most former Eastern Bloc countries, the weapon is known simply as the  \" Kalashnikov \"  or  \" AK \" . The differences between the milled and stamped receivers includes the use of rivets rather than welds on the stamped receiver, as well as the placement of a small dimple above the magazine well for stabilization of the magazine. \n \n === Replacement === \n In 1974, the Soviets began replacing their AK-47 and AKM rifles with a newer design, the [[AK-74]], which uses [[5.45\u00d739mm]] ammunition. This new rifle and cartridge had only started to be manufactured in Eastern European nations when the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union collapsed]], drastically slowing production of the AK-74 and other weapons of the former Soviet bloc. \n \n == Design == \n The AK-47 was designed to be a simple, reliable fully automatic rifle that could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, using mass production methods that were state of the art in the Soviet Union during the late 1940s. < ref name= \" Dunnigan \"  / >  The AK-47 uses a [[Gas-operated reloading#Long-stroke piston|long stroke gas system]] that is generally associated with great reliability in adverse conditions. < ref name= \" The AR-15 2010 \"  / > < ref name= \" Tilstra \"  / > < ref name= \" Dockery \"  / >  The large gas piston, generous clearances between moving parts, and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle. \n \n === Cartridge === \n {{Main|7.62\u00d739mm}} \n [[File:RussianWP.jpg|thumb|Wound Profiles of Russian small-arms ammunition compiled by Dr. [[Martin Fackler]] on behalf of the U.S. military]] \n \n The AK fires the 7.62\u00d739mm [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]] with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|715|m/s|abbr=on}}. < ref name= \" izhmash \"  / > \n The cartridge weight is {{convert|16.3|g|oz|abbr=on|1}}, the projectile weight is {{convert|7.9|g|gr|abbr=on|0}}. < ref name= \" ammoweight \"  / >  The original Soviet M43 bullets are 123 grain [[boat-tail bullet]]s with a copper-plated steel jacket, a large steel core, and some lead between the core and the jacket. The AK has excellent penetration when shooting through heavy foliage, walls or a common vehicle's metal body and into an opponent attempting to use these things as cover. The 7.62\u00d739mm M43 projectile does not generally fragment when striking an opponent and has an unusual tendency to remain intact even after making contact with bone. The 7.62\u00d739mm round produces significant wounding in cases where the bullet tumbles (yaws) in tissue, < ref name= \" Bellamy p146-155 \"  / >  but produces relatively minor wounds in cases where the bullet exits before beginning to yaw. < ref name= \" autogenerated7 \"  / > < ref name= \" Roberts-2008 \"  / > < ref name= \" Purdy \"  / >  In the absence of yaw, the M43 round can pencil through tissue with relatively little injury. < ref name= \" autogenerated7 \"  / > < ref name= \" Bellamy p148 \"  / > \n \n Most, if not all, of the 7.62\u00d739mm ammunition found today is of the upgraded M67 variety. This variety deleted the steel insert, shifting the center of gravity rearward, and allowing the projectile to destabilize (or yaw) at about {{convert|3.3|in|cm|abbr=on}}, nearly {{convert|6.7|in|cm|abbr=on}} earlier in tissue than the M43 round. < ref name= \" uthr.org \"  / >  This change also reduces penetration in ballistic gelatin to ~{{convert|25|in|cm|abbr=on}} for the newer M67 round versus ~{{convert|29|in|cm|abbr=on}} for the older M43 round. < ref name= \" uthr.org \"  / > < ref name= \" Fackler \"  / >  However, the wounding potential of M67 is mostly limited to the small permanent wound channel the bullet itself makes, especially when the bullet yaws. < ref name= \" uthr.org \"  / > \n \n === Operating mechanism === \n [[File:Chinese type 56 AK47.jpg|thumb|The gas-operated mechanism of a [[Type 56 assault rifle|Norinco AK-47]]]] \n \n To fire, the operator inserts a loaded magazine, pulls back and releases the charging handle, and then pulls the [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger]]. In semi-automatic, the firearm fires only once, requiring the trigger to be released and depressed again for the next shot. In fully automatic, the rifle continues to fire automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger. After ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant, rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle. The build-up of gases inside the gas cylinder drives the long-stroke piston and [[Bolt (firearm)|bolt]] carrier rearward and a cam guide machined into the underside of the bolt carrier, along with an ejector spur on the bolt carrier rail guide, rotates the bolt approximately 35\u00b0 and unlocks it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt. The moving assembly has about {{convert|5.5|mm|abbr=on|1}} of free travel, which creates a delay between the initial recoil impulse of the piston and the bolt unlocking sequence, allowing gas pressures to drop to a safe level before the seal between the chamber and the bolt is broken. The AK-47 does not have a gas valve; excess gases are ventilated through a series of radial ports in the gas cylinder. The Kalashnikov operating system offers no [[primary extraction]] upon bolt rotation, but uses an extractor claw to eject the spent cartridge case. < ref name= \" army \"  / > \n \n === Barrel === \n [[File:Ak-47-iraqis.jpg|thumb|AK-47 barrel and its distinctive gas block with a horizontal row of gas relief ports]] \n \n The rifle received a barrel with a [[Chrome plating|chrome-lined]] bore and four right-hand grooves at a 240 & nbsp;mm (1 in 9.45 in) or 31.5 calibers [[Rifling#Twist rate|rifling twist rate]]. The gas block contains a gas channel that is installed at a slanted angle in relation to the bore axis. The muzzle is threaded for the installation of various muzzle devices such as a muzzle brake or a [[blank-firing adaptor]]. \n \n ===Gas block=== \n The gas block of the AK-47 features a cleaning rod capture or sling loop. Gas relief ports that alleviate gas pressure are placed horizontally in a row on the gas cylinder. \n \n === Fire selector === \n [[File:Viet Cong soldier DD-ST-99-04298.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng]] soldier armed with an AK-47, standing beneath the flag of the [[National Liberation Front of South Vietnam]]]] \n \n The fire selector is a large lever located on the right side of the rifle, it acts as a dust-cover and prevents the charging handle from being pulled fully to the rear when it is on safe. < ref name= \" arsenalinc1 \"  / >  It is operated by the shooter's right fore-fingers and has 3 settings: safe (up), full-auto (center), and semi-auto (down). < ref name= \" arsenalinc1 \"  / >  The reason for this is that under stress a soldier will push the selector lever down with considerable force bypassing the full-auto stage and setting the rifle to semi-auto. < ref name= \" arsenalinc1 \"  / >  To set the AK-47 to full-auto requires the deliberate action of centering the selector lever. < ref name= \" arsenalinc1 \"  / >  To operate the fire selector lever, right handed shooters have to briefly remove their right hand from the pistol grip, which is ergonomically sub-optimal. Some AK-type rifles also have a more traditional selector lever on the left side of the receiver just above the pistol grip. < ref name= \" arsenalinc1 \"  / >  This lever is operated by the shooter's right thumb and has three settings: safe (forward), full-auto (center), and semi-auto (backward). < ref name= \" arsenalinc1 \"  / > \n \n === Sights === \n [[File:AK47-rear-sight.jpg|thumb|Rear sight of a Chinese Type 56, featuring {{convert|100|to|800|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} settings and omission of a battle zero setting]] \n \n The AK-47 uses a notched rear tangent [[iron sight]] calibrated in {{convert|100|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} increments from {{convert|100|to|800|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}. < ref name= \" scribd1 \"  / >  The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field. Horizontal adjustment requires a special drift tool and is done by the armory before issue or if the need arises by an armorer after issue. The sight line elements are approximately {{convert|48.5|mm|in|1|abbr=on|lk=on}} over the bore axis. The  \" [[point-blank range]] \"  battle zero setting  \" '''''\u041f''''' \"  standing for ''\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f'' (constant) on the 7.62\u00d739mm AK-47 rear tangent sight element corresponds to a {{convert|300|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} zero. < ref name= \" scribd1 \"  / > {{sfn|Rottman|2011|p=42}} These settings mirror the Mosin\u2013Nagant and SKS rifles, which the AK-47 replaced. For the AK-47 combined with service cartridges, the 300 m battle zero setting limits the [[External ballistics#Bullet drop|apparent  \" bullet rise \" ]] within approximately {{convert|-5|to|+31|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} relative to the line of sight. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass (the belt buckle, according to Russian and former Soviet doctrine) of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant, as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier. Some AK-type rifles have a front sight with a flip-up luminous dot that is calibrated at {{convert|50|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}, for improved night fighting. < ref name= \" scribd1 \"  / > \n \n === Furniture === \n The AK-47 was originally equipped with a buttstock, handguard and an upper heat guard made from solid wood. With the introduction of the Type 3 receiver the buttstock, lower handguard and upper heatguard were manufactured from [[birch]] [[plywood]] [[laminates]]. < ref name= \" browningmgs.com \"  / >  Such engineered woods are stronger and resist warping better than the conventional one-piece patterns, do not require lengthy maturing, and are cheaper. The wooden furniture was finished with the Russian amber shellac finishing process.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} AKS and AKMS models featured a downward-folding metal butt-stock similar to that of the German [[MP40|MP40 submachine-gun]], for use in the restricted space in the [[BMP development|BMP infantry combat vehicle]], as well as by paratroops. All 100 series AKs use plastic furniture with side-folding stocks. \n \n === Magazines === \n \n [[File:Bakelite AK magazines.jpg|thumb| \" Bakelite \"  rust-colored steel-reinforced 30-round plastic box 7.62\u00d739mm AK magazines.

There are also 10, 20, and 40-round box magazines, as well as 75-round [[drum magazine|drum]] magazines. \n \n The AK-47's standard 30-round magazines have a pronounced curve that allows them to smoothly feed ammunition into the chamber. Their heavy steel construction combined with  \" feed-lips \"  (the surfaces at the top of the magazine that control the angle at which the cartridge enters the chamber) machined from a single steel billet makes them highly resistant to damage.

In the West, one fires a group of shots into the target and then simply measures the overall diameter of the group. The Russians, on the other hand, fire a group of shots into the target. They then draw two circles on the target, one for the maximum vertical dispersion of hits and one for the maximum horizontal dispersion of hits. They then disregard the hits on the outer part of the target and only count half of the hits (50% or R < sub > 50 < /sub > ) on the inner part of the circles. This dramatically reduces the overall diameter of the groups. They then use both the vertical and horizontal measurements of the reduced groups to measure accuracy. This [[circular error probable]] method used by the Russians and other European militaries cannot be converted and is not comparable to US military methods for determining rifle accuracy. When the R < sub > 50 < /sub >  results are doubled the hit probability increases to 93.7%. \n \n {| class= \" wikitable \"  style= \" text-align: center; \" \n !colspan= \" 7 \" |AK-47 semi-automatic and short burst dispersion with 57-N-231 steel core service ammunition < ref name= \" \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0443\u0430\u043b \" > Instruction on small business 7,62- mm Kalashnikov (AK). - Moscow: Military Publishing House of the Ministry of Defense of the USSR, 1967. < /ref > \n |- \n !Range||Vertical accuracy of fire (R < sub > 50 < /sub > ) semi-automatic||Horizontal accuracy of fire (R < sub > 50 < /sub > ) semi-automatic||Vertical accuracy of fire (R < sub > 50 < /sub > ) short burst||Horizontal accuracy of fire (R < sub > 50 < /sub > ) short burst||Remaining bullet energy||Remaining bullet velocity \n |- \n |{{convert|0|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|2036|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|718|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}} \n |- \n |{{convert|100|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|9|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|11|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|1540|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|624|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}} \n |- \n |{{convert|200|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|11|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|18|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|22|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|1147|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|539|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}} \n |- \n |{{convert|300|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|17|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|12|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|27|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|33|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|843|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|462|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}} \n |- \n |{{convert|400|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|23|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|16|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|31|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|44|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|618|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|395|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}} \n |- \n |{{convert|500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|29|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|20|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|46|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|56|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|461|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|342|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}} \n |- \n |{{convert|600|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|35|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|24|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|56|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|67|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|363|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|303|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}} \n |- \n |{{convert|700|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|42|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|29|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|66|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|78|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|314|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|282|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}} \n |- \n |{{convert|800|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|49|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|34|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|76|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|89|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|284|J|ftlbf|abbr=on}}||{{convert|268|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}} \n |} \n *  < small > R < sub > 50 < /sub >  means the closest 50 percent of the shot group will all be within a circle of the mentioned diameter. < /small > \n \n The vertical and horizontal mean (R < sub > 50 < /sub > ) deviations with service ammunition at {{convert|800|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} for AK platforms are. \n {| class= \" wikitable \"  style= \" text-align: center; \" \n !colspan= \" 4 \" |SKS, AK-47, AKM, and AK-74 dispersion at {{convert|800|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} \n |- \n !Rifle||Firing mode||Vertical accuracy of fire (R < sub > 50 < /sub > )||Horizontal accuracy of fire (R < sub > 50 < /sub > ) \n |- \n |[[SKS]]  < small > (1945) < /small > ||semi-automatic||{{convert|38|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|29|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} \n |- \n |AK-47  < small > (1949) < /small > ||semi-automatic||{{convert|49|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|34|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} \n |- \n |AK-47  < small > (1949) < /small > ||short burst||{{convert|76|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|89|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} \n |- \n |[[AKM]]  < small > (1959) < /small > ||short burst||{{convert|64|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|90|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} \n |- \n |[[AK-74]]  < small > (1974) < /small > ||short burst||{{convert|48|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}||{{convert|64|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} \n |- \n |} \n \n == Users == \n < !--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

In contrast, the Russians and Chinese used the AK-47; its low production cost and ease of manufacture allow them to make AKs in vast numbers. \n \n In the pro-communist states, the AK-47 became a symbol of the [[Third World]] revolution.

For example, Western works of fiction (movies, television, novels, video games) often portray criminals, gang members, insurgents, and terrorists using AK-47s as the weapon of choice. Conversely, throughout the [[developing world]], the AK-47 can be positively attributed with [[revolutionaries]] against foreign occupation, [[imperialism]], or [[colonialism]]. Numerous fictional depictions of the Soviet/Russian armed forces such as ''[[Call of Duty#Modern Warfare series|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare]]'' show them armed with 7.62\u00d739mm AK variants (AK-47 or AKM) as their standard-issue rifles, a long-standing anachronism thanks to the AK-47's iconic status, despite the Soviets having actually replaced them with the 5.45\u00d739mm AK-74 in the 1970s.
