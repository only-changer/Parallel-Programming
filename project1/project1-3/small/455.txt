Ward]], the organist and choir director at [[Grace Church, Newark]], was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today. Just as Bates had been inspired to write her poem, Ward, too, was inspired. The tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from [[Coney Island]] back to his home in [[New York City]] after a leisurely summer day and he immediately wrote it down. He composed the tune for the old hymn  \" O Mother Dear, Jerusalem \" , retitling the work  \" Materna \" .

Kennedy]] administration, there have been efforts to give  \" America the Beautiful \"  legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to, or in place of,  \" [[The Star-Spangled Banner]] \" , but so far this has not succeeded. Proponents prefer  \" America the Beautiful \"  for various reasons, saying it is easier to sing, more melodic, and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as  \" The Star-Spangled Banner \" . Some prefer  \" America the Beautiful \"  over  \" The Star-Spangled Banner \"  due to the latter's war-oriented imagery; others prefer  \" The Star-Spangled Banner \"  for the same reason. While that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem,  \" America the Beautiful \"  continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of Americans, and was even being considered before 1931 as a candidate to become the national anthem of the United States. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/america-the-beautiful-p2-2456277 |title=Who Wrote  \" America the Beautiful \" ?

The song is often played during formal ceremonies or at the opening of important events...Many artists have recorded their own renditions of this patriotic song, including Elvis Presley and Mariah Carey.
