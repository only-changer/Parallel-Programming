Like other [[character encoding]]s, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and [[character (computing)|character]] symbols (i.e. [[grapheme]]s and [[control character]]s). This allows [[Digital data|digital]] devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 [[English alphabet|alphabetic]] characters, 10 [[numerical digit]]s, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols. To include all these, and control characters compatible with the [[CCITT|Comit\u00e9 Consultatif International T\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et T\u00e9l\u00e9graphique]] (CCITT) [[International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA2) standard of 1924, < ref name= \" Bruxy_2005 \" > {{cite web |title=BruXy: Radio Teletype communication |date=2005-10-10 |access-date=2016-05-09 |url=http://bruxy.regnet.cz/web/hamradio/EN/radio-teletype-communication/ |quote=The transmitted code use International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA-2) which was introduced by CCITT in 1924. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412130035/http://bruxy.regnet.cz/web/hamradio/EN/radio-teletype-communication/ |archive-date=April 12, 2016 |url-status=live }} < /ref > < ref name= \" bdcode \" > {{cite web |author-last=Smith |author-first=Gil |title=Teletype Communication Codes |publisher=Baudot.net |date=2001 |url=http://www.baudot.net/docs/smith--teletype-codes.pdf |access-date=2008-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820043949/http://www.baudot.net/docs/smith--teletype-codes.pdf |archive-date=August 20, 2008 |url-status=live }} < /ref >  [[FIELDATA]] (1956{{citation needed|date=June 2016|reason=My sources state 1957 rather than 1956, but Wikipedia states 1956 in various places.

In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes. It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for [[data transmission]], as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code. < ref name= \" Mackenzie_1980 \" / > {{rp|215, 236 \u00a74}} \n \n The committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits ([[octet (computing)|octet]]s) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with [[binary-coded decimal]]. However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a [[parity bit]] for [[error checking]] if desired. < ref name= \" Mackenzie_1980 \" / > {{rp|217, 236 \u00a75}} [[8-bit computing|Eight-bit]] machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0. < ref name= \" Sawyer_1995 \" > {{cite book |author-first1=Stanley A. |author-last1=Sawyer |author-first2=Steven George |author-last2=Krantz |title=A TeX Primer for Scientists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXLDwmIJNkUC & pg=PA13 |date=1995 |publisher=[[CRC Press, LLC]] |isbn=978-0-8493-7159-2 |page=13 |bibcode=1995tps..book.....S |access-date=October 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222151907/https://books.google.com/books?id=bXLDwmIJNkUC & pg=PA13 |archive-date=December 22, 2016 |url-status=live }} < /ref > \n \n ===Internal organization=== \n The code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification.

[[Lower case|Lowercase]] letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase. To keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter ''A'' was placed in position 41 < sub > [[hexadecimal|hex]] < /sub >  to match the draft of the corresponding British standard. < ref name= \" Mackenzie_1980 \" / > {{rp|238 \u00a718}} The digits 0\u20139 are prefixed with 011, but the remaining [[Nibble|4 bits]] correspond to their respective values in binary, making conversion with [[binary-coded decimal]] straightforward. \n \n Many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters; an important subtlety is that these were based on ''mechanical'' typewriters, not ''electric'' typewriters. < ref name= \" Savard \" > {{cite web |title=Computer Keyboards |url=http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/kybint.htm |author-first=John J.

This discrepancy from typewriters led to [[bit-paired keyboard]]s, notably the [[Teletype Model 33]], which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, not to traditional mechanical typewriters.

NO-WS-CTL.) < /ref >  Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Other schemes, such as [[markup language]]s, address page and document layout and formatting. \n \n The original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional, for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a [[data stream]], and sometimes accidental, for example with the meaning of  \" delete \" . \n \n Probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available [[punched tape|paper tape]] reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 ([[Delete key|Delete]]) became de facto standards. The Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of Control-G (code 7, BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally, as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character.  Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of [[underscore]]), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as  \" delete previous character \"  was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected. \n \n When a Teletype 33 ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving Control-Q (XON,  \" transmit on \" ) caused the tape reader to resume.  This technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a  \" handshaking \"  signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by a second Control-S to resume output.  The 33 ASR also could be configured to employ Control-R (DC2) and Control-T (DC4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units equipped with this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and  < s > TAPE < /s >  respectively. < ref name= \" McConnell \" > {{cite web |title=Understanding ASCII Codes |author-last1=McConnell |author-first1=Robert |author-last2=Haynes |author-first2=James |author-last3=Warren |author-first3=Richard |url=http://www.nadcomm.com/ascii_code.htm |access-date=2014-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227190425/http://www.nadcomm.com/ascii_code.htm |archive-date=February 27, 2014 |url-status=live }} < /ref > \n \n ====Delete  &  Backspace==== \n The Teletype could not move the head backwards, so it did not put a key on the keyboard to send a BS (backspace). Instead there was a key marked {{keypress|RUB OUT}} that sent code 127 (DEL). The purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a hand-typed paper tape: the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to back it up, then type the rubout, which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored. < ref > {{cite mailing list |url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-05/msg00448.html |title=Re: editor and word processor history (was: Re: RTF for emacs) |author=Barry Margolin |mailing-list=help-gnu-emacs |date=May 29, 2014 |access-date=July 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133149/http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-05/msg00448.html |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }} < /ref >  Teletypes were commonly used for the less-expensive computers from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], so these systems had to use the available key and thus the DEL code to erase the previous character. < ref name= \" pdp-6-monitor-manual \" > {{cite web |url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp6/DEC-6-0-EX-SYS-UM-IP-PRE00_Multiprogramming_System_Manual_1965.pdf |title=PDP-6 Multiprogramming System Manual |page=43 |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) |date=1965 |access-date=July 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714140253/http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp6/DEC-6-0-EX-SYS-UM-IP-PRE00_Multiprogramming_System_Manual_1965.pdf |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }} < /ref > < ref name= \" pdp-10-monitor-manual \" > {{cite web |url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/1970_PDP-10_Ref/1970PDP10Ref_Part3.pdf |title=PDP-10 Reference Handbook, Book 3, Communicating with the Monitor |at=p. 5-5 |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) |date=1969 |access-date=July 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115083418/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/1970_PDP-10_Ref/1970PDP10Ref_Part3.pdf |archive-date=November 15, 2011 |url-status=live }} < /ref >  Because of this, DEC video terminals (by default) sent the DEL code for the key marked  \" Backspace \"  while the key marked  \" Delete \"  sent an escape sequence, while many other terminals sent BS for the Backspace key.

The  \" escape \"  character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. This is the same meaning of  \" escape \"  encountered in URL encodings, [[C (programming language)|C language]] strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so-called  \" [[ANSI escape code]] \"  (or, more properly, a  \" [[Control Sequence Introducer]] \" ) from ECMA-48 (1972) and its successors, beginning with ESC followed by a  \" < nowiki > [ < /nowiki > \"  (left-bracket) character. An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an [[out-of-band data|out-of-band]] character used to terminate an operation, as in the [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] and [[vi]] [[text editor]]s. In [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and [[window (computing)|windowing]] systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to [[exit (system call)|exit]] (terminate) altogether. \n \n ====End of Line==== \n The inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring  \" plain text \"  files between systems. The best example of this is the [[newline]] problem on various [[operating system]]s. Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both  \" Carriage Return \"  (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and  \" Line Feed \"  (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). The name  \" Carriage Return \"  comes from the fact that on a manual [[typewriter]] the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary.  The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line. \n \n [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] operating systems ([[OS/8]], [[RT-11]], [[RSX-11]], [[RSTS/E|RSTS]], [[TOPS-10]], etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally [[Teleprinter|Teletype machines]]) would work. By the time so-called  \" glass TTYs \"  (later called CRTs or terminals) came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention. When [[Gary Kildall]] created [[CP/M]] he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]'s [[RT-11]]. Until the introduction of [[PC DOS]] in 1981, [[IBM]] had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless. IBM's [[PC DOS]] (also marketed as [[MS-DOS]] by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on CP/M, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://dosmandrivel.blogspot.com/2007/08/is-dos-rip-off-of-cpm.html|title=Is DOS a Rip-Off of CP/M?|author=Tim Paterson|date=August 8, 2007|website=DosMan Drivel|author-link=Tim Paterson|access-date=April 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420075137/http://dosmandrivel.blogspot.com/2007/08/is-dos-rip-off-of-cpm.html|archive-date=April 20, 2018|url-status=live}} < /ref >  and [[Windows]] inherited it from MS-DOS. \n \n Unfortunately, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone.

[[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, and [[Amiga]] systems, adopted this convention from Multics. The original [[Macintosh OS]], [[Apple DOS]], and [[ProDOS]], on the other hand, used carriage return (CR) alone as a line terminator; however, since Apple replaced these operating systems with the Unix-based [[macOS]] operating system, they now use line feed (LF) as well.

The [[Telnet]] protocol defined an ASCII  \" [[Network Virtual Terminal]] \"  (NVT), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network.

To delete the previous character, one had to back up the paper tape punch, which for mechanical and simplicity reasons was a button on the punch itself and not the keyboard, then type the rubout character. They therefore placed a key producing rubout at the location used on typewriters for backspace. When systems used these terminals and provided command-line editing, they had to use the  \" rubout \"  code to perform a backspace, and often did not interpret the backspace character (they might echo  \" < code > ^H < /code > \"  for backspace). Other terminals not designed for paper tape made the key at this location produce Backspace, and systems designed for these used that character to back up. Since the delete code often produced a backspace effect, this also forced terminal manufacturers to make any {{key press|Delete}} key produce something other than the Delete character.}} \n |} \n \n Other representations might be used by specialist equipment, for example [[ISO 2047]] graphics or [[hexadecimal]] numbers. \n \n ==={{anchor|ASCII-printable-characters}}Printable characters=== \n < !-- Anchor linked to from redirects -- > \n Codes 20 < sub > [[hexadecimal|hex]] < /sub >  to 7E < sub > [[hexadecimal|hex]] < /sub > , known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, [[punctuation mark]]s, and a few miscellaneous symbols.

We worked with Fred Mocking, who by now was in Sales at [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]], on a type cylinder that would compromise the changing characters so that the meanings of 1961 ASCII were not totally lost.

One could class some of these variations as  \" [[ASCII extension]]s \" , although some misuse that term to represent all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII's character-map in the 7-bit range. Furthermore, the ASCII extensions have also been mislabelled as ASCII. \n \n ==={{anchor|7-bit}}7-bit codes=== \n {{Main|ISO/IEC 646|ITU T.50}}{{See also|UTF-7}} \n From early in its development, < ref > \" Specific Criteria \" , attachment to memo from R. W. Reach,  \" X3-2 Meeting \u2013 September 14 and 15 \" , September 18, 1961 < /ref >  ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard. \n \n < !-- ITU-T ITU T.50 \n International Reference Alphabet (IRA) \n International Alphabet No. 5 (IA5) -- > \n Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as [[ISO 646]] (1967) that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English [[alphabet]] and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the United Kingdom's [[pound sterling]] (\u00a3). Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since ASCII suited the needs of only the US and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters. \n \n Many other countries developed variants of ASCII to include non-English letters (e.g. [[\u00e9]], [[\u00f1]], [[\u00df]], [[\u0141]]), currency symbols (e.g. [[\u00a3]], [[\u00a5]]), etc. See also [[YUSCII]] (Yugoslavia). \n \n It would share most characters in common, but assign other locally useful characters to several [[code point]]s reserved for  \" national use \" . However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 < ref name= \" Mar\u00e9chal_1967 \" > {{citation |author-last=Mar\u00e9chal |author-first=R. |title=ISO/TC 97 \u2013 Computers and Information Processing: Acceptance of Draft ISO Recommendation No. 1052 |date=1967-12-22}} < /ref >  caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points. \n \n ISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, is a 7-bit character set. It does not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and, therefore, which character a code represented, and in general, text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway. \n \n Because the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to  \" national use \"  code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc. programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as \n \n : < code > \u00e4 a\u00c4i\u00dc = '\u00d6n'; \u00fc < /code > \n \n instead of \n \n : < code > { a[i] = '\\n'; } < /code > \n \n [[C trigraph]]s were created to solve this problem for [[ANSI C]], although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use. Many programmers kept their computers on US-ASCII, so plain-text in Swedish, German etc. (for example, in e-mail or [[Usenet]]) contained  \" {, } \"  and similar variants in the middle of words, something those programmers got used to. For example, a Swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch, could get  \" N{ jag har sm|rg}sar \"  as the answer, which should be  \" N\u00e4 jag har sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sar \"  meaning  \" No I've got sandwiches \" . \n \n In Japan and Korea, still as of 2020-ies, a variation of ASCII is used, in which the [[backslash]] (5C hex) is rendered as \u00a5 (a [[Yen sign]], in Japan) or \u20a9 (a [[Won sign]], in Korea). This means that for example the file path C:\\Users\\Smith is shown as C:\u00a5Users\u00a5Smith (in Japan) or C:\u20a9Users\u20a9Smith (in Korea). \n \n ==={{anchor|8-bit}}8-bit codes=== \n {{Main|Extended ASCII|ISO/IEC 8859}}{{See also|UTF-8}} \n < !-- to be mentioned [[USASCII-8]] -- > \n Eventually, as 8-, [[16-bit computing|16-]] and [[32-bit computing|32-bit]] (and later [[64-bit computing|64-bit]]) computers began to replace [[12-bit computing|12-]], [[18-bit computing|18-]] and [[36-bit computing|36-bit]] computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit relatives of ASCII. In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters. \n \n Encodings include [[ISCII]] (India), [[VISCII]] (Vietnam). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard. \n \n Most early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs, and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 31 with more graphics. [[Kaypro]] [[CP/M]] computers used the  \" upper \"  128 characters for the Greek alphabet. \n \n The [[PETSCII]] code [[Commodore International]] used for their [[8-bit computing|8-bit]] systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963, instead of the more common ASCII-1967, such as found on the [[ZX Spectrum character set|ZX Spectrum]] computer. [[ATASCII|Atari]] 8-bit computers and [[Galaksija (computer)#Character ROM|Galaksija]] computers also used ASCII variants. \n \n The IBM PC defined [[code page 437]], which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as [[Emoticon|smiley faces]], and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. Operating systems such as [[DOS]] supported these code pages, and manufacturers of [[IBM PC]]s supported them in hardware. [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] developed the [[Multinational Character Set]] (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular [[VT220]] [[computer terminal|terminal]] as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. The Macintosh defined [[Mac OS Roman]] and Postscript also defined a set, both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets. \n \n The [[ISO/IEC 8859]] standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) finally provided a standard that most systems copied (at least as accurately as they copied ASCII, but with many substitutions). A popular further extension designed by Microsoft, [[Windows-1252]] (often mislabeled as [[ISO-8859-1]]), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing.  ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encodings until 2008 when [[UTF-8]] became more common. < ref name= \" UTF-8_2008 \" / > \n \n [[ISO/IEC 4873]] introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80\u20139F [[hexadecimal]] range, as part of extending the 7-bit ASCII encoding to become an 8-bit system. < ref name= \" Unicode-5.0_2006 \" > {{cite book |author=The Unicode Consortium |editor-first=Julie D. |editor-last=Allen |title=The Unicode standard, Version 5.0 |date=2006-10-27 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley Professional]] |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, US |isbn=978-0-321-48091-0 |chapter-url=http://unicode.org/book/ch13.pdf |access-date=2015-03-13 |chapter=Chapter 13: Special Areas and Format Characters |page=314}} < /ref > \n \n ===Unicode=== \n {{Main|Unicode|ISO/IEC 10646}}{{See also|Basic Latin (Unicode block)}} \n [[Unicode]] and the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using [[natural number]]s called ''code points'') and encoding (to 8-, 16- or 32-bit binary formats, called [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]] and [[UTF-32]]). \n \n ASCII was incorporated into the Unicode (1991) character set as the first 128 symbols, so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows [[UTF-8]] to be [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with 7-bit ASCII, as a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters.  Even more importantly, [[forward compatibility]] is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged. < ref > {{cite web |title=utf-8(7) & nbsp;\u2013 Linux manual page |publisher=Man7.org |date=2014-02-26 |url=http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/utf-8.7.html |access-date=2014-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422232059/http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/utf-8.7.html |archive-date=April 22, 2014 |url-status=live }} < /ref > \n \n ==See also== \n * [[3568 ASCII]], an asteroid named after the character encoding \n * [[Alt codes]] \n * [[Ascii85]] \n * [[ASCII art]] \n * [[ASCII Ribbon Campaign]] \n * [[Basic Latin (Unicode block)]] (ASCII as a subset of Unicode) \n * [[Extended ASCII]] \n * [[HTML decimal character rendering]] \n * [[Jargon File]], a glossary of computer programmer slang which includes a list of common slang names for ASCII characters \n * [[List of computer character sets]] \n * [[List of Unicode characters]] \n \n ==Notes== \n {{Notelist|40em}} \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist|30em|refs= \n < ref name= \" INCITS_4-1986_R2012 \" > {{cite web |title=INCITS 4-1986[R2012]: Information Systems - Coded Character Sets - 7-Bit American National Standard Code for Information Interchange (7-Bit ASCII) |date=2012-06-15 |url=https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=796 |access-date=2020-02-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228222040/https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=796 |archive-date=2020-02-28}} < /ref > \n < ref name= \" INCITS_4-1986_R2017 \" > {{cite web |title=INCITS 4-1986[R2017]: Information Systems - Coded Character Sets - 7-Bit American National Standard Code for Information Interchange (7-Bit ASCII) |date=2017-11-02 |orig-year=2017-06-09 |url=https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=1829 |access-date=2020-02-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228221645/https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=1829 |archive-date=2020-02-28}} < /ref > \n < ref name= \" Bemer_1980_Inside \" > {{cite book |title=General Purpose Software |chapter=Chapter 1: Inside ASCII |author-last=Bemer |author-first=Robert William |author-link=Robert William Bemer |date=1980 |series=Best of Interface Age |volume=2 |location=Portland, OR, USA |publisher=dilithium Press |isbn=978-0-918398-37-6 |lccn=79-67462 |chapter-url=http://bookzz.org/dl/1210234/1105c6 |access-date=2016-08-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827000956/http://dlx.bookzz.org/genesis/772000/c80a62495acf1e1a5b966de23c1f989a/_as/%5BInterface_Age_Staff%5D_Best_of_Interface_Age%2C_Volum%28BookZZ.org%29.pdf |archive-date=August 27, 2016 |pages=1\u201350 |postscript=,}} from: \n * {{cite journal |title=Inside ASCII \u2013 Part I |author-last=Bemer |author-first=Robert William |author-link=Robert William Bemer |journal=Interface Age |volume=3 |issue=5 |date=May 1978 |pages=96\u2013102}} \n * {{cite journal |title=Inside ASCII \u2013 Part II |author-last=Bemer |author-first=Robert William |author-link=Robert William Bemer |journal=Interface Age |volume=3 |issue=6 |date=June 1978 |pages=64\u201374}} \n * {{cite journal |title=Inside ASCII \u2013 Part III |author-last=Bemer |author-first=Robert William |author-link=Robert William Bemer |journal=Interface Age |volume=3 |issue=7 |date=July 1978 |pages=80\u201387}} < /ref > \n }} \n \n ==Further reading== \n * {{cite journal |title=A Proposal for Character Code Compatibility |author-first=Robert William |author-last=Bemer |author-link=Robert William Bemer |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=3 |issue=2 |date=1960 |doi=10.1145/366959.366961 |pages=71\u201372|s2cid=9591147 }} \n * {{cite web |title=The Babel of Codes Prior to ASCII: The 1960 Survey of Coded Character Sets: The Reasons for ASCII |author-first=Robert William |author-last=Bemer |author-link=Robert William Bemer |date=2003-05-23 |url=http://www.trailing-edge.com/~bobbemer/SURVEY.HTM |access-date=2016-05-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017062654/http://www.trailing-edge.com/~bobbemer/SURVEY.HTM |archive-date=2013-10-17 |postscript=,}} from: \n ** {{cite journal |title=Survey of coded character representation |author-first=Robert William |author-last=Bemer |author-link=Robert William Bemer |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=639\u2013641 |date=December 1960 |doi=10.1145/367487.367493|s2cid=21403172 }} \n ** {{cite journal |title=Survey of punched card codes |author-first1=H.
