The name ''fucus'' appears in a number of [[Taxon|taxa]]. \n \n ==Classifications== \n {{further|wikispecies:Algae}}The committee on the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature has recommended certain suffixes for use in the classification of algae. These are '''-phyta''' for division, ''-phyceae'' for class, ''-phycideae'' for subclass, ''-ales'' for order, ''-inales'' for suborder, ''-aceae'' for family, ''-oidease'' for subfamily, a Greek-based name for genus, and a Latin-based name for species. \n \n ===Algal characteristics basic to primary classification=== \n \n The primary classification of algae is based on certain morphological features. The chief among these are (a) pigment constitution of the cell, (b) chemical nature of stored food materials, (c) kind, number, point of insertion and relative length of the flagella on the motile cell, (d) chemical composition of cell wall and (e) presence or absence of a definitely organized nucleus in the cell or any other significant details of cell structure. \n \n ===History of classification of algae=== \n \n Although [[Carolus Linnaeus]] (1754) included algae along with lichens in his 25th class Cryptogamia, he did not elaborate further on the classification of algae. \n \n [[Jean Pierre \u00c9tienne Vaucher]] (1803) was perhaps the first to propose a system of classification of algae, and he recognized three groups, Conferves, Ulves, and Tremelles. While [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link]] (1820) classified algae on the basis of the colour of the pigment and structure, [[William Henry Harvey]] (1836) proposed a system of classification on the basis of the habitat and the pigment. [[J. G. Agardh]] (1849\u20131898) divided algae into six orders: Diatomaceae, Nostochineae, Confervoideae, Ulvaceae, Floriadeae and Fucoideae. Around 1880, algae along with fungi were grouped under Thallophyta, a division created by Eichler (1836). Encouraged by this, [[Adolf Engler]] and [[Karl Anton Eugen Prantl|Karl A. E. Prantl]] (1912) proposed a revised scheme of classification of algae and included fungi in algae as they were of opinion that fungi have been derived from algae. The scheme proposed by Engler and Prantl is summarised as follows: < ref > {{Cite book |title=Botany for degree students algae |last=B. R. Vashishta Revised by A. K. Sinha and V. P.

Chloroplasts contain circular [[DNA]] like that in cyanobacteria and are interpreted as representing reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. However, the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae, reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events. The table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae. Their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right.

This dispersal can be accomplished by air, water, or other organisms. Due to this, spores can be found in a variety of environments: fresh and marine waters, air, soil, and in or on other organisms. < ref name= \" Round8 \"  / >  Whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands. \n \n The spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind, as well as by living carriers. < ref name= \" Round8 \"  / >  However, not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae, as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them. < ref name= \" Round8 \"  / >  Marine spores are often spread by ocean currents.

It is, therefore, possible to identify species occurring by locality, such as  \" [[Pacific]] algae \"  or  \" [[North Sea]] algae \" . When they occur out of their localities, hypothesizing a transport mechanism is usually possible, such as the hulls of ships.

Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column ([[phytoplankton]]) provide the food base for most marine [[food chain]]s.

Scientists developed the ATS, which consists of shallow, 100-foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form, and studied its efficacy for three years. They found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers, streams, and oceans. Researchers collected and dried the nutrient-rich algae from the ATS and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer. They found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ATS organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers. < ref > {{cite web |url= http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/may10/algae0510.htm |title=Algae: A Mean, Green Cleaning Machine |publisher=USDA Agricultural Research Service |date=7 May 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101019142625/http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/may10/algae0510.htm |archive-date=19 October 2010}} < /ref >  Algae scrubbers, using bubbling upflow or vertical waterfall versions, are now also being used to filter aquaria and ponds. \n \n ===Polymers=== \n Various polymers can be created from algae, which can be especially useful in the creation of bioplastics.
