Then, the antiprism is called a '''right antiprism''', and its 2''n'' side faces are [[Isoceles triangle|'''''isosceles''''']] triangles. \n \n == Uniform antiprism == \n A '''[[Prismatic uniform polyhedron|uniform]] antiprism''' has two [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] [[Regular polygon|'''''regular''''']] n-gon base faces, and 2''n'' [[Equilateral triangle|'''''equilateral''''']] triangles as side faces. \n \n Uniform antiprisms form an infinite class of vertex-transitive polyhedra, as do uniform prisms. For {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}}, we have the regular [[tetrahedron]] as a ''digonal antiprism'' (degenerate antiprism); for {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 3}}, the regular [[octahedron]] as a ''triangular antiprism'' (non-degenerate antiprism). \n \n The [[dual polyhedra]] of the antiprisms are the [[Trapezohedron|trapezohedra]]. \n \n The existence of antiprisms was discussed and their name was coined by [[Johannes Kepler]], though it is possible that they were previously known to [[Archimedes]], as they satisfy the same conditions on faces and on vertices as the [[Archimedean solid]]s. \n \n {{UniformAntiprisms}} \n \n === Schlegel diagrams === \n {| class=wikitable \n |- align=center \n |[[File:Triangular antiprismatic graph.png|100px]] < BR > A3 \n |[[File:Square antiprismatic graph.png|100px]] < BR > A4 \n |[[File:Pentagonal antiprismatic graph.png|100px]] < BR > A5 \n |[[File:Hexagonal antiprismatic graph.png|100px]] < BR > A6 \n |[[File:Heptagonal antiprism graph.png|100px]] < BR > A7 \n |[[File:Octagonal antiprismatic graph.png|100px]] < BR > A8 \n |} \n \n \n == Cartesian coordinates == \n [[Cartesian coordinates]] for the vertices of a [[#Right antiprism|right]] antiprism (i.e. with regular ''n''-gon bases and isosceles side faces) are \n : < math > \\left( \\cos\\frac{k\\pi}{n}, \\sin\\frac{k\\pi}{n}, (-1)^k h \\right) < /math > \n \n with ''k'' ranging from 0 to 2''n'' & nbsp;\u2013 & nbsp;1; \n \n if the triangles are equilateral, then \n : < math > 2h^2=\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}-\\cos\\frac{2\\pi}{n}. < /math > \n \n == Volume and surface area == \n Let ''a'' be the edge-length of a [[Uniform polyhedron|uniform]] antiprism; then the volume is \n : < math > V = \\frac{n \\sqrt{4\\cos^2\\frac{\\pi}{2n}-1}\\sin \\frac{3\\pi}{2n} }{12\\sin^2\\frac{\\pi}{n}}~a^3, < /math > \n \n and the surface area is \n : < math > A = \\frac{n}{2} \\left( \\cot{\\frac{\\pi}{n}} + \\sqrt{3}\\right) a^2. < /math > \n \n == Related polyhedra == \n There are an infinite set of [[Truncation (geometry)|truncated]] antiprisms, including a lower-symmetry form of the [[truncated octahedron]] (truncated triangular antiprism).

Crossed forms have intersecting [[vertex figure]]s, and are denoted by  \" inverted \"  fractions: ''p''/(''p'' & nbsp;\u2013 & nbsp;''q'') instead of ''p''/''q''; example: 5/3 instead of 5/2. \n \n A '''right star antiprism''' has two [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] [[#Right antiprism|coaxial]] [[Regular polygon|regular]] [[Convex polytope|'''''convex''''']] or [[Star polygon|'''''star''''']] polygon base faces, and 2''n'' [[isosceles triangle]] side faces. \n \n Any star antiprism with ''regular'' convex or star polygon bases can be made a ''right'' star antiprism (by translating and/or twisting one of its bases, if necessary). \n \n In the retrograde forms but not in the prograde forms, the triangles joining the convex or star bases intersect the axis of rotational symmetry. Thus: \n \n *Retrograde star antiprisms with regular convex polygon bases cannot have all equal edge lengths, so cannot be uniform.  \" Exception \" : a retrograde star antiprism with equilateral triangle bases (vertex configuration: 3.3/2.3.3) can be uniform; but then, it has the appearance of an equilateral triangle: it is a degenerate star polyhedron. \n \n *Similarly, some retrograde star antiprisms with regular star polygon bases cannot have all equal edge lengths, so cannot be uniform. Example: a retrograde star antiprism with regular star 7/5-gon bases (vertex configuration: 3.3.3.7/5) cannot be uniform. \n \n Also, star antiprism compounds with regular star ''p''/''q''-gon bases can be constructed if ''p'' and ''q'' have common factors. Example: a star 10/4-antiprism is the compound of two star 5/2-antiprisms. \n \n {| class= \" wikitable collapsible collapsed \" \n |+ style= \" text-align:center;colspan:6; \"  | Star ''p''/''q''-antiprisms by symmetry, for p \u2264 12 \n |- \n !
