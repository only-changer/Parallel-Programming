However, Athens, [[Bronze Age collapse|like many other Bronze Age settlements]], went into economic decline for around 150 years afterwards. \n \n [[Iron Age]] burials, in the [[Kerameikos]] and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900 & nbsp;BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region. < ref > Osborne, R. 1996, 2009. ''Greece in the Making 1200\u2013479 & nbsp;BC''. < /ref >  The leading position of Athens may well have resulted from its central location in the Greek world, its secure stronghold on the Acropolis and its access to the sea, which gave it a natural advantage over inland rivals such as [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and [[Sparta]]. \n \n [[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|[[Delian League]], under the leadership of Athens before the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431 & nbsp;BC]] \n \n By the 6th century BC, widespread social unrest led to the reforms of [[Solon]]. These would pave the way for the eventual introduction of democracy by [[Cleisthenes]] in 508 & nbsp;BC. Athens had by this time become a significant naval power with a large fleet, and helped the [[Ionian Revolt|rebellion of the Ionian cities]] against [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule. In the ensuing [[Greco-Persian Wars]] Athens, together with Sparta, led the coalition of Greek states that would eventually repel the Persians, defeating them decisively at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] in 490 & nbsp;BC, and crucially at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] in 480 & nbsp;BC. However, this did not prevent Athens from being [[Achaemenid destruction of Athens|captured and sacked twice]] by the Persians within one year, after a heroic but ultimately failed resistance at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] by [[Sparta]]ns and other Greeks led by [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]], < ref > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHe0KeXyL_AC & pg=PA34|title=Nothing Less than Victory: Decisive Wars and the Lessons of History|access-date=24 December 2014|isbn=978-1400834303|last1=Lewis|first1=John David|date=25 January 2010|archive-date=12 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312034708/https://books.google.com/books?id=BHe0KeXyL_AC & pg=PA34|url-status=live}} < /ref >  after both [[Boeotia]] and [[Attica]] fell to the Persians. \n \n The decades that followed became known as the [[Fifth-century Athens|Golden Age of Athenian democracy]], during which time Athens became the leading city of [[Ancient Greece]], with its cultural achievements laying the foundations for [[western culture|Western civilization]]. The playwrights [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] flourished in Athens during this time, as did the historians [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], the physician [[Hippocrates]], and the philosopher [[Socrates]]. Guided by [[Pericles]], who promoted the arts and fostered democracy, Athens embarked on an ambitious building program that saw the construction of the Acropolis of Athens (including the [[Parthenon]]), as well as empire-building via the [[Delian League]]. Originally intended as an association of [[Greek city-state]]s to continue the fight against the Persians, the league soon turned into a vehicle for Athens's own imperial ambitions. The resulting tensions brought about the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404 & nbsp;BC), in which Athens was defeated by its rival Sparta. \n \n By the mid-4th century BC, the northern Greek kingdom of [[Macedon]] was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338 & nbsp;BC the armies of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] defeated an alliance of some of the Greek city-states including Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea, effectively ending Athenian independence. Later, under Rome, Athens was given the status of a [[free city (classical antiquity)|free city]] because of its widely admired schools. The Roman emperor [[Hadrian]], in the 2nd century AD, ordered the construction of a library, a gymnasium, an aqueduct which is still in use, several temples and sanctuaries, a bridge and financed the completion of the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Olympian Zeus]]. \n \n By the end of [[Late Antiquity]], Athens had shrunk due to sacks by the [[Herulians]], [[Visigoths]], and [[Early Slavs]] which caused massive destruction in the city. In this era, the first Christian churches were built in Athens, and the Parthenon and other temples were converted into churches. Athens expanded its settlement in the second half of the Middle Byzantine Period, in the 9th to 10th centuries AD, and was relatively prosperous during the [[Crusades]], benefiting from Italian trade. After the [[Fourth Crusade]] the [[Duchy of Athens]] was established. In 1458 it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and entered a long period of decline. \n \n Following the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]], Athens was chosen as the capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons. At the time, it was reduced to a town of about 4,000 people in a loose swarm of houses along the foot of the Acropolis. The first [[King of Greece]], Otto of Bavaria, commissioned the architects [[Stamatios Kleanthis]] and [[Eduard Schaubert]] to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state. \n \n The first modern city plan consisted of a triangle defined by the Acropolis, the ancient cemetery of [[Kerameikos]] and the new palace of the Bavarian king (now housing the [[Greek Parliament]]), so as to highlight the continuity between modern and ancient Athens. Neoclassicism, the international style of this epoch, was the architectural style through which Bavarian, French and Greek architects such as Hansen, Klenze, Boulanger or Kaftantzoglou designed the first important public buildings of the new capital. In 1896, Athens hosted the first modern [[Olympic Games]]. During the 1920s a number of [[Greek refugees]], expelled from [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] after the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]] and [[Greek genocide]], swelled Athens's population; nevertheless it was most particularly following [[World War II]], and from the 1950s and 1960s, that the population of the city exploded, and Athens experienced a gradual expansion. \n \n In the 1980s it became evident that smog from factories and an ever-increasing fleet of automobiles, as well as a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge. A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the [[Attiki Odos]] motorway, the expansion of the [[Athens Metro]], and the new [[Athens International Airport]]), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city.

The neighborhood is located north of the historical centre of Athens, between Kolonos to the east and Kerameikos to the west, and north of Gazi. [[Metaxourgeio]] is frequently described as a transition neighborhood. After a long period of abandonment in the late 20th century, the area is acquiring a reputation as an artistic and fashionable neighborhood following the opening of art galleries, museums, restaurants and caf\u00e9s. [1] Local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighborhood have reinforced a sense of community and artistic expression. Anonymous art pieces containing quotes and statements in both English and Ancient Greek have sprung up throughout the neighborhood, bearing statements such as  \" Art for art's sake \"  (\u03a4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd).

A number of its renovated buildings also host fashionable bars, making it a hotspot for the city in the last decade, while live music restaurants known as  \" rebetadika \" , after [[rebetiko]], a unique form of music that blossomed in [[Syros]] and Athens from the 1920s until the 1960s, are to be found. Rebetiko is admired by many, and as a result rebetadika are often crammed with people of all ages who will sing, dance and drink till dawn. \n *The ''[[Gazi, Athens|Gazi]]'' ({{lang-el|\u0393\u03ba\u03ac\u03b6\u03b9}}) area, one of the latest in full redevelopment, is located around a historic gas factory, now converted into the ''[[Technopolis (Gazi)|Technopolis]]'' cultural multiplex, and also includes artists' areas, small clubs, bars and restaurants, as well as Athens's  \" [[Gay village]] \" . The metro's expansion to the western suburbs of the city has brought easier access to the area since spring 2007, as the [[Line 3 (Athens Metro)|line 3]] now stops at Gazi ([[Kerameikos]] station). \n * ''Syntagma'', [[Syntagma Square]], ({{lang-el|\u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1}}/Constitution Square), is the capital's central and [[List of city squares by size|largest square]], lying adjacent to the [[Hellenic Parliament|Greek Parliament]] (the former Royal Palace) and the city's most notable [[Grande Bretagne|hotels]]. Ermou Street, an approximately {{convert|1|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off|adj=mid|-long|frac=8}} pedestrian road connecting Syntagma Square to Monastiraki, is a consumer paradise for both Athenians and tourists.

It is to be found between the Parliament and [[Zappeion]] buildings, the latter of which maintains its own garden of seven hectares. \n \n Parts of the City Centre have been redeveloped under a masterplan called the ''Unification of Archeological Sites of Athens'', which has also gathered funding from the EU to help enhance the project. < ref name=EUfund/ > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.astynet.gr/ |title=Eaxa :: \u0395\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd \u03a7\u03c9\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3 \u0391.\u0395 |publisher=Astynet.gr |access-date=21 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228090100/http://www.astynet.gr/ |archive-date=28 February 2009 |url-status=live }} < /ref >  The landmark [[Dionysiou Areopagitou Street]] has been pedestrianised, forming a scenic route. The route starts from the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] at Vasilissis Olgas Avenue, continues under the southern slopes of the Acropolis near [[Plaka]], and finishes just beyond the [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in [[Thiseio]].

The urban area of Athens proper (excluding the port of Piraeus) covered less than a thousandth of the area of the city-state, though its population density was of course far higher: modern estimates for the population of the built-up area tend to indicate around 35\u201345,000 inhabitants, though uncertainties persist around density of occupation, household size and whether there was a significant suburban population beyond the walls. \n \n The ancient site of the main city is centred on the rocky hill of the acropolis.

The new port of [[Piraeus]] was a prototype harbour with the infrastructure and housing located in the site between modern passenger section of the port (named Kantharos in ancient times) and the Pasalimani harbour (named Zea in ancient times). The old one [[Phalerum|Phaliro]] was in the site of modern [[Palaio Faliro]] and gradually declined after the construction of the new prototype port but remained as a minor port and important settlement with historic significance in late Classical times. The rapid expansion of the modern city, which continues to this day, took off with [[Developed country|industrial]] growth in the 1950s and 1960s. < ref > [http://www.gto.gr/athens/athens/athens.html Greek Tourist Organizer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512011836/http://www.gto.gr/athens/athens/athens.html |date=12 May 2008 }} \u2013 Retrieved on 6 January 2007 < /ref >  The expansion is now particularly toward the East and North East (a tendency greatly related to the new [[Athens International Airport|Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]] and the [[Attiki Odos]], the freeway that cuts across Attica).

They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style. A visitor will quickly notice the absence of tall buildings: Athens has very strict [[height restriction laws]] in order to ensure the Acropolis hill is visible throughout the city. Despite the variety in styles, there is evidence of continuity in elements of the architectural environment through the city's history. < ref name=Secular/ > \n \n For the greatest part of the 19th century Neoclassicism dominated Athens, as well as some deviations from it such as [[Eclecticism]], especially in the early 20th century. Thus, the [[Old Royal Palace]] was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, [[Baron Theophil von Hansen|Theophil Freiherr von Hansen]] and [[Ernst Ziller]] took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings such as the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Athens Academy]] and the [[Zappeion]] Hall. Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such as [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]]'s [[Iliou Melathron]]. \n \n Beginning in the 1920s, [[modern architecture]] including [[Bauhaus]] and [[Art Deco]] began to exert an influence on almost all Greek architects, and buildings both public and private were constructed in accordance with these styles. Localities with a great number of such buildings include [[Kolonaki]], and some areas of the centre of the city; neighbourhoods developed in this period include [[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]]. < ref > [[Helen Fessas-Emmanouil|Fessas-Emmanouil, Helen]].

Athenian clubs have also had domestic and international success in other sports. \n \n The Athens area encompasses a variety of [[terrain]], notably hills and mountains rising around the city, and the capital is the only major city in Europe to be bisected by a [[mountain range]]. Four mountain ranges extend into city boundaries and thousands of kilometres of trails criss-cross the city and neighbouring areas, providing exercise and wilderness access on [[hiking|foot]] and [[Mountain biking|bike]]. \n \n Beyond Athens and across the prefecture of Attica, outdoor activities include [[skiing]], [[rock climbing]], [[hang gliding]] and windsurfing. Numerous outdoor clubs serve these sports, including the Athens Chapter of the [[Sierra Club]], which leads over 4,000 outings annually in the area. \n \n ==== Sports clubs ==== \n \n {|class= \" wikitable \" \n |- \n !colspan= \" 5 \" |Notable sport clubs based inside the boundaries of [[#Municipality (City) of Athens|Athens Municipality]] \n |- \n ! style= \" width:150px; \" |Club \n ! style= \" width:120px; \" |Founded \n !Sports \n !District \n !Achievements \n |- \n |[[Panellinios G.S.]]||1891||Basketball, Volleyball, [[Handball]], Track and Field and others ||[[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]]||Panhellenic titles in Basketball, Volleyball, Handball, many honours in Track and Field \n |- \n |[[GS Apollon Smyrnis|Apollon Smyrni]]||1891 < br/ > < small > (originally in [[Smyrni]]) < /small > ||Football, Basketball, Volleyball and others ||[[Rizoupoli]]||Earlier long-time presence in A Ethniki \n |- \n |[[Ethnikos G.S.

Thanks to his efforts, Athens was awarded the first modern Olympic Games. In 1896, the city had a population of 123,000 < ref name=tung2/ >  and the event helped boost the city's international profile. Of the venues used for these Olympics, the [[Kallimarmaro]] Stadium, and [[Zappeion]] were most crucial. The Kallimarmaro is a replica of the ancient Athenian stadiums, and the only major stadium (in its capacity of 60,000) to be made entirely of white marble from Mount [[Penteli, Greece|Penteli]], the same material used for construction of the Parthenon. \n \n < gallery widths= \" 200px \"  heights= \" 175px \" > \n File:Castaigne - Fencing before the king of Greece, 1896 Summer Olympics.jpg|''Fencing before the [[George I of Greece|king of Greece]]'' at the [[1896 Summer Olympics]]. \n File:Panathinaiko-Stadion 2014-5.JPG|The Panathenaic Stadium of Athens ([[Panathenaic Stadium|Kallimarmaron]]) dates back to the 4th century BC and has hosted the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic Games]] in 1896. \n < /gallery > \n \n ===== 1906 Summer Olympics ===== \n {{Main|1906 Intercalated Games}} \n The [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Summer Olympics]], or the 1906 Intercalated games, were held in Athens.

This idea later lost support from the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] and these games were discontinued. \n \n ===== 2004 Summer Olympics ===== \n {{Main|2004 Summer Olympics}} \n [[File:10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympics.jpg|thumb|left|10,000-meter final during the 2004 Olympic Games]] \n \n Athens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics on 5 September 1997 in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, after having lost a previous bid to host the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], to [[Atlanta]], United States. < ref name=oly/ >  It was to be the second time Athens would host the games, following the inaugural event of 1896. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990, the 1997 bid was radically improved, including an appeal to Greece's Olympic history.

In 2000 the Organising Committee's president was replaced by [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]], who was the president of the original Bidding Committee in 1997. From that point forward, preparations continued at a highly accelerated, almost frenzied pace. \n \n Although the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5 & nbsp;billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern [[urban planning|urban development]]. < ref name=olyy > {{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/08/29/closing.ceremony/ |title=Athens bids farewell to the Games |date=30 August 2004 |access-date=29 March 2007 |work=CNN |publisher=CNN.com |archive-date=15 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115082941/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/08/29/closing.ceremony/ |url-status=live }} < /ref >  Some of the finest sporting venues in the world were created in the city, all of which were fully ready for the games.
