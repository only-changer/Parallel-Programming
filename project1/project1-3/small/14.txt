It is located between [[Maastricht]] (NL) and [[Li\u00e8ge]] (BE) in the west, and [[Bonn]] and [[Cologne]],{{efn|{{convert|61|km|abbr=on}} east of Aachen}} in the east. The city is flown through by the [[Wurm River]], and together with [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]], Aachen is the only larger German city in the [[drainage basin]] of the Meuse. Aachen is the seat of the [[Aachen (district)|City Region Aachen]] ({{lang-de|link=yes|St\u00e4dteregion Aachen}}). \n \n Aachen developed from a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] settlement and spa, subsequently becoming the preferred medieval Imperial residence of Emperor [[Charlemagne]] of the [[Frankish Empire]], and, from 936 to 1531, the place where 31 [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperors]] were crowned [[List of German monarchs|Kings of the Germans]]. \n \n One of Germany's leading institutes of higher education in technology, the [[RWTH Aachen University]] (''Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lisch Technische Hochschule Aachen''), is located in the city. Its university hospital ''[[Uniklinikum Aachen|Uniklinik RWTH Aachen]]'' is Europe's largest single-building hospital. Aachen's industries include science, engineering and information technology. In 2009, Aachen was ranked eighth among cities in Germany for innovation. \n \n The [[Aachen dialect|regional dialect]] spoken in the city is a [[Central Franconian]], [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] variant with strong South [[Low Franconian]] ([[Limburgish]]) influences from the dialects in the neighbouring Netherlands. As a [[Rhenish]] city, Aachen is one of the main centres of [[carnival]] celebrations [[Carnival in Germany|in Germany]], along with [[Cologne Carnival|Cologne]], [[Mainz carnival|Mainz]] and [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. The [[culinary]] speciality the city is best known for are [[Aachener Printen]], a type of [[gingerbread]]. \n \n == History == \n {{Main|History of Aachen}} \n {{Further|Timeline of Aachen}} \n {{see also|Free Imperial City of Aachen}} \n \n === Early history === \n Flint quarries on the [[Lousberg]], Schneeberg, and K\u00f6nigsh\u00fcgel, first used during [[Neolithic]] times (3000\u20132500 BC), attest to the long occupation of the site of Aachen, as do recent finds under the modern city's ''Elisengarten'' pointing to a former settlement from the same period. [[Bronze Age]] (around 1600 BC) settlement is evidenced by the remains of barrows (burial mounds) found, for example, on the Klausberg. During the [[Iron Age]], the area was settled by Celtic peoples < ref > {{harvnb|Schumacher|2009}}. < /ref >  who were perhaps drawn by the marshy Aachen basin's [[hot spring|hot sulphur springs]] where they worshipped [[Grannus]], god of light and healing. \n \n Later, the 25-hectare Roman spa resort town of Aquae Granni was, according to legend, founded by Grenus, under [[Hadrian]], around 124 AD. Instead, the fictitious founder refers to the Celtic god, and it seems it was the Roman 6th Legion at the start of the 1st century AD that first channelled the hot springs into a spa at B\u00fcchel,{{sfn|Bridgwater|Aldrich|1968}}{{efn|This audio file is Andreas Schaub explaining the archaeological record in court in ''Arch\u00e4ologie am Hof''.}} adding at the end of the same century the ''M\u00fcnstertherme'' spa, < ref > {{harvnb|Anon|2013}}. < /ref >  two water pipelines, and a probable{{clarify|date=December 2016}} sanctuary dedicated to Grannus. A kind of forum, surrounded by colonnades, connected the two spa complexes. There was also an extensive residential area, part of it inhabited by a flourishing Jewish community. < ref name= \" jewishencyclopedia.com \" > {{harvnb|Freimann|1906|p=301}}. < /ref >  The Romans built bathhouses near [[Burtscheid]]. A temple precinct called ''Vernenum'' was built near the modern [[Kornelim\u00fcnster/Walheim]]. Today, remains have been found of three bathhouses, < ref name= \" DofA \" > {{harvnb|McClendon|1996|p=1}}. < /ref >  including two fountains in the ''Elisenbrunnen'' and the Burtscheid bathhouse. \n \n Roman civil administration in Aachen eventually broke down as the baths and other public buildings (along with most of the [[villae rusticae]] of the surrounding countryside) were destroyed around AD 375 at the start of the [[migration period]]. The last Roman coin finds are from the time of Emperor [[Gratian]] (AD 375-383).  Rome withdrew its troops from the area, but the town remained populated. By 470, the town came to be ruled by the [[Ripuarian Franks]] < ref name= \" Coll \" > {{harvnb|Held|1997|p=2}}. < /ref >  and subordinated to their capital, [[Cologne]]. \n \n === Etymology === \n The name ''Aachen'' is a modern descendant, like southern German {{lang|de|Ach(e)}}, {{lang-de|Aach}}, meaning  \" river \"  or  \" stream \" , from [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|ahha}}, meaning  \" water \"  or  \" stream \" , which directly translates (and etymologically corresponds) to [[Latin]] {{lang|la|Aquae}}, referring to the springs. The location has been inhabited by humans since the [[Neolithic]] era, about 5,000 years ago, attracted to its warm [[mineral spring]]s. Latin {{lang|la|Aquae}} figures in Aachen's [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name {{lang|la|Aquae granni}}, which meant  \" waters of [[Grannus]] \" , referring to the [[Celts|Celtic]] god of healing who was worshipped at the springs. < ref name= \" munro \"  / > < ref name= \" tourism \" > {{harvnb|Mielke|2013}}. < /ref >  This word became {{lang|wa|\u00c5xhe}} in [[Walloon language|Walloon]] and {{lang|fr|Aix}} in French, and subsequently {{lang|fr|Aix-la-Chapelle}} after [[Charlemagne]] had his [[palatine Chapel, Aachen|palatine chapel]] built there in the late 8th century and then made the city his empire's capital. \n \n As a spa city, Aachen has the right to name itself ''Bad Aachen'', but chooses not to, so it remains on the top of alphabetical lists. \n \n Aachen's name in French and German evolved in parallel.

The city remained a [[free imperial city]], subject to the emperor only, but was politically far too weak to influence the policies of any of its neighbours. The only dominion it had was over [[Burtscheid]], a neighbouring territory ruled by a [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]]. It was forced to accept that all of its traffic must pass through the  \" Aachener Reich \" . Even in the late 18th century the Abbess of Burtscheid was prevented from building a road linking her territory to the neighbouring estates of the [[Duchy of J\u00fclich|duke of J\u00fclich]]; the city of Aachen even deployed its handful of soldiers to chase away the road-diggers. \n \n As an imperial city, Aachen held certain political privileges that allowed it to remain independent{{clarify|date=December 2016}} of the troubles of Europe for many years. It remained a direct vassal of the Holy Roman Empire throughout most of the Middle Ages.

Only 4,000 inhabitants remained in the city; the rest had followed evacuation orders. Its first Allied-appointed mayor, [[Franz Oppenhoff]], was assassinated by an SS commando unit. \n \n ==== History of Aachen Jews ==== \n [[File:View of the old synagogue in Aachen after its destruction during Kristallnacht 02.jpg|thumb|View of the {{ill|Old Synagogue in Aachen|de|Alte Synagoge (Aachen)}} after its destruction during [[Kristallnacht]], November 1938]] \n During the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period, Aachen was the site of a flourishing [[Jewish]] community. Later, during the [[Carolingian]] empire, a Jewish community lived near the royal palace. < ref name= \" jewishencyclopedia.com \"  / >  In 797, Isaac, a Jewish merchant, accompanied two ambassadors of [[Charlemagne]] to the court of [[Harun al-Rashid]]. He returned to Aachen in July 802, bearing an elephant called ''[[Abul-Abbas]]'' as a gift for the emperor. < ref > {{cite news |date=21 July 2003 |title=Baghdad, Jerusalem, Aachen -- On the Trail of the White Elephant |url=https://www.dw.com/en/baghdad-jerusalem-aachen-on-the-trail-of-the-white-elephant/a-923561 |work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|access-date=18 February 2020}} < /ref >  During the 13th century, many Jews converted to Christianity, as shown in the records of the [[Aachen Cathedral|Aachen Minster]] (today's Cathedral). In 1486, the Jews of Aachen offered gifts to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] during his coronation ceremony. In 1629, the Aachen Jewish community was expelled from the city. In 1667, six Jews were allowed to return. Most of the Aachen Jews settled in the nearby town of [[Burtscheid]]. On 16 May 1815, the Jewish community of the city offered an homage in its synagogue to the Prussian king, [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]]. A Jewish cemetery was acquired in 1851. 1,345 Jews lived in the city in 1933. The synagogue was destroyed during ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in 1938. In 1939, after emigration and arrests, 782 Jews remained in the city. After [[World War II]], only 62 Jews lived there. In 2003, 1,434 Jews were living in Aachen. In Jewish texts, the city of Aachen was called ''Aish'' or ''Ash'' (\u05d0\u05e9). \n \n === 21st century === \n The city of Aachen has developed into a technology hub as a by-product of hosting one of the leading [[Institute of Technology|universities of technology]] in Germany with the [[RWTH Aachen]] (Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Technische Hochschule), known especially for mechanical engineering, automotive and manufacturing technology as well as for its research and academic hospital [[Klinikum Aachen]], one of the largest medical facilities in Europe. \n \n == Geography == \n [[File:2017-05 Vaalserberg 13.jpg|thumb|The tripoint, where the borders of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands meet at the [[Vaalserberg]]]] \n \n Aachen is located in the middle of the [[Meuse\u2013Rhine Euroregion]], close to [[Vaalserberg#Three-Country Point|the border tripoint of Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium]]. The town of [[Vaals]] in the Netherlands lies nearby at about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} from Aachen's city centre, while the Dutch city of [[Heerlen]] and [[Eupen]], the capital of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], are both located about {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} from Aachen city centre. Aachen lies near the head of the open valley of the [[Wurm]] (which today flows through the city in canalised form), part of the larger basin of the [[Meuse]], and about {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the [[High Fens]], which form the northern edge of the [[Eifel]] uplands of the [[Rhenish Massif]]. \n \n The maximum dimensions of the city's territory are {{convert|21.6|km|mi|frac=8|abbr=on}} from north to south, and {{convert|17.2|km|frac=8|abbr=on}} from east to west. The city limits are {{convert|87.7|km|frac=8|abbr=on}} long, of which {{convert|23.8|km|frac=8|abbr=on}} border Belgium and {{convert|21.8|km|frac=8|abbr=on}} the Netherlands. The highest point in Aachen, located in the far southeast of the city, lies at an elevation of {{convert|410|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The lowest point, in the north, and on the border with the Netherlands, is at {{convert|125|m|ft|abbr=on}}. \n \n === Climate === \n As the westernmost city in Germany < ref name= \" munro \" > {{harvnb|Munro|1995|p=1}}. < /ref >  (and close to the Low Countries), Aachen and the surrounding area belongs to a [[Temperate climate|temperate]] [[Oceanic climate|climate zone]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|Cfb]]), with humid weather, mild winters, and warm summers. Because of its location north of the [[Eifel]] and the [[High Fens]] and its subsequent prevailing westerly weather patterns, rainfall in Aachen (on average 805 & nbsp;mm/year) is comparatively higher than, for example, in [[Bonn]] (with 669 & nbsp;mm/year). Another factor in the local weather forces of Aachen is the occurrence of [[Foehn winds]] on the southerly air currents, which results from the city's geographic location on the northern edge of the Eifel. \n \n Because the city is surrounded by hills, it suffers from [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion-related]] smog. Some areas of the city have become [[urban heat island]]s as a result of poor heat exchange, both because of the area's natural geography and from human activity. The city's numerous cold air corridors, which are slated to remain as free as possible from new construction, therefore play an important role in the urban climate of Aachen. < ref > {{harvnb|Aachen Department of Environment|2013}}. < /ref > \n \n The January average is \n {{convert|3.0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, while the July average is {{convert|18.5|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Precipitation is almost evenly spread throughout the year. \n {{Weather box \n | location = Aachen, Germany for 1981\u20132010 (Source: DWD) \n | metric first = Yes \n | single line = Yes \n | Jan record high C = 16.2 \n | Feb record high C = 20.2 \n | Mar record high C = 23.1 \n | Apr record high C = 28.7 \n | May record high C = 32.8 \n | Jun record high C = 34.5 \n | Jul record high C = 36.7 \n | Aug record high C = 36.8 \n | Sep record high C = 32.2 \n | Oct record high C = 26.9 \n | Nov record high C = 22.1 \n | Dec record high C = 16.8 \n | year record high C = 36.8 \n | Jan high C = 5.4 \n | Feb high C = 6.2 \n | Mar high C = 10.1 \n | Apr high C = 14.1 \n | May high C = 18.2 \n | Jun high C = 20.8 \n | Jul high C = 23.3 \n | Aug high C = 23.0 \n | Sep high C = 19.2 \n | Oct high C = 14.8 \n | Nov high C = 9.3 \n | Dec high C = 5.9 \n | year high C = 14.2 \n | Jan mean C = 3.0 \n | Feb mean C = 3.2 \n | Mar mean C = 6.4 \n | Apr mean C = 9.5 \n | May mean C = 13.6 \n | Jun mean C = 16.2 \n | Jul mean C = 18.5 \n | Aug mean C = 18.0 \n | Sep mean C = 14.6 \n | Oct mean C = 11.0 \n | Nov mean C = 6.6 \n | Dec mean C = 3.7 \n | year mean C = 10.4 \n | Jan low C = 0.7 \n | Feb low C = 0.6 \n | Mar low C = 3.2 \n | Apr low C = 5.5 \n | May low C = 9.2 \n | Jun low C = 11.8 \n | Jul low C = 14.1 \n | Aug low C = 13.9 \n | Sep low C = 11.2 \n | Oct low C = 7.9 \n | Nov low C = 4.3 \n | Dec low C = 1.5 \n | year low C = 7.0 \n | Jan record low C = -16.4 \n | Feb record low C = -15.8 \n | Mar record low C = -9.9 \n | Apr record low C = -4.7 \n | May record low C = 0.4 \n | Jun record low C = 3.9 \n | Jul record low C = 5.8 \n | Aug record low C = 6.7 \n | Sep record low C = 3.8 \n | Oct record low C = -3.7 \n | Nov record low C = -7.6 \n | Dec record low C = -14.3 \n | year record low C = -16.4 \n | precipitation colour = green \n | Jan precipitation mm = 68.1 \n | Feb precipitation mm = 63.6 \n | Mar precipitation mm = 67.0 \n | Apr precipitation mm = 55.7 \n | May precipitation mm = 72.0 \n | Jun precipitation mm = 80.3 \n | Jul precipitation mm = 75.2 \n | Aug precipitation mm = 74.8 \n | Sep precipitation mm = 69.2 \n | Oct precipitation mm = 70.1 \n | Nov precipitation mm = 66.1 \n | Dec precipitation mm = 74.9 \n | year precipitation mm = 836.8 \n | Jan sun = 63.5 \n | Feb sun = 83.0 \n | Mar sun = 119.3 \n | Apr sun = 163.4 \n | May sun = 195.6 \n | Jun sun = 196.6 \n | Jul sun = 208.5 \n | Aug sun = 195.7 \n | Sep sun = 149.3 \n | Oct sun = 120.4 \n | Nov sun = 71.0 \n | Dec sun = 50.2 \n | year sun = 1616.5 \n | source 1 = Data derived from [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] < ref > {{harvnb|Federal Ministry of Transport, Building, and Urban Development|2013}}. < /ref > \n | date = May 2013 \n }} \n \n == Geology == \n [[File:Aachen Felsen St.Adalbert.JPG|thumb|Layered [[sandstone]] and [[claystone]] [[formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] from the [[Devonian]] period below St. Adalbert Church in Aachen]] \n \n The geology of Aachen is very structurally heterogeneous. The oldest occurring rocks in the area surrounding the city originate from the [[Devonian]] period and include [[carboniferous]] [[sandstone]], [[greywacke]], [[claystone]] and [[limestone]]. These formations are part of the [[Rhenish Massif]], north of the High Fens. In the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod of the [[Carboniferous]] geological period, these rock layers were narrowed and folded as a result of the [[Variscan orogeny]].

While the clay (which was the basis for a major [[pottery]] industry in nearby [[Raeren]]) is mostly found in the lower areas of Aachen, the hills of the [[Aachen Forest]] and the [[Lousberg]] were formed from upper Cretaceous sand and chalk deposits. More recent sedimentation is mainly located in the north and east of Aachen and was formed through [[tertiary]] and [[quaternary]] river and wind activities. \n \n Along the major [[thrust fault]] of the [[Variscan orogeny]], there are over 30 [[thermal spring]]s in Aachen and [[Burtscheid]]. Additionally, the subsurface of Aachen is traversed by numerous [[active fault]]s that belong to the Rurgraben fault system, which has been responsible for numerous earthquakes in the past, including the 1756 [[D\u00fcren]] earthquake < ref name= \" duerenEQ \" > {{harvnb|University of Cologne, Seismological Station Bensberg|2013}}. < /ref >  and the [[1992 Roermond earthquake]], < ref name= \" Roermond \" > {{harvnb|Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia|2013}}. < /ref >  which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the [[Netherlands]]. \n \n == Demographics == \n [[File:Age structure aachen vs germany.svg|thumb|Age distribution of Aachen's population next to Germany's (2014)]] \n \n Aachen has 245,885 inhabitants (as of 31 December 2015), of whom 118,272 are female, and 127,613 are male. < ref name= \" Zensus 2011 \" > {{cite web |url=http://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/bevoelkerungszahlen_zensus/zensus_rp3_dez15.html |last=Information und Technik Nordrhein-Westfalen |title=Bev\u00f6lkerung im Regierungsbezirk K\u00f6ln |access-date=16 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408003047/https://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/bevoelkerungszahlen_zensus/zensus_rp3_dez15.html |archive-date=8 April 2017 |url-status=dead}} < /ref > \n \n The unemployment rate in the city is, as of April 2012, 9.7 percent. < ref > {{harvnb|Aktualisierung|2012}}. < /ref >  At the end of 2009, the foreign-born residents of Aachen made up 13.6 percent of the total population. < ref name= \" StatJahrbuch2009 \" > {{harvnb|City of Aachen|2012}}. < /ref >  A significant portion of foreign residents are students at the [[RWTH Aachen University]]. \n \n {| class= \" wikitable sortable \" \n !

The origin of this [[church treasure]] is in dispute as some say Charlemagne himself endowed his chapel with the original collection, while the rest were collected over time. Others say all of the objects were collected over time, from such places as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Constantinople]]. < ref name= \" DofA6 \"  / >  The location of this treasury has moved over time and was unknown until the 15th century when it was located in the Matthiaskapelle (St. Matthew's Chapel) until 1873, when it was moved to the Karlskapelle (Charles' Chapel). From there it was moved to the Hungarian Chapel in 1881 and in 1931 to its present location next to the Allerseelenkapelle (Poor Souls' Chapel). < ref name= \" DofA6 \"  / >  Only six of the original [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] objects have remained, and of those only three are left in Aachen: the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]], a [[diptych]] of Christ, and an early [[Byzantine silk]]. The [[Coronation Gospels]] and a [[St. Stephen's Purse|reliquary burse]] of [[St. Stephen]] were moved to [[Vienna]] in 1798 and the [[Talisman of Charlemagne]] was given as a gift in 1804 to [[Josephine Bonaparte]] and subsequently to [[Rheims Cathedral]]. < ref name= \" DofA6 \"  / >  210 documented pieces have been added to the treasury since its inception, typically to receive in return legitimisation of linkage to the heritage of Charlemagne.

[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] both gave numerous works of art by [[Hans von Reutlingen]]. < ref name= \" DofA6 \"  / >  Continuing the tradition, objects continued to be donated until the present, each indicative of the period of its gifting, with the last documented gift being a chalice from 1960 made by [[Ewald Matar\u00e9]]. < ref name= \" DofA6 \"  / > \n \n === Rathaus === \n {{Main|Aachen Rathaus}}[[File:AachenCityHallFromSouthHDR.jpg|thumb|Aachen Rathaus seen from the south]] \n The Aachen Rathaus, (English: Aachen City Hall or Aachen Town Hall) dated from 1330, < ref name= \" WB \" > {{harvnb|Merkl|2007|p=2}} < /ref >  lies between two central squares, the ''Markt'' (marketplace) and the ''Katschhof'' (between city hall and cathedral). The coronation hall is on the first floor of the building. Inside one can find five frescoes by the Aachen artist [[Alfred Rethel]] which show legendary scenes from the life of Charlemagne, as well as Charlemagne's signature. Also, precious replicas of the [[Imperial Regalia]] are kept here. < ref name= \" young2 \"  / > \n \n Since 2009, the city hall has been a station on the ''Route Charlemagne'', a tour programme by which historical sights of Aachen are presented to visitors. At the city hall, a museum exhibition explains the history and art of the building and gives a sense of the historical coronation banquets that took place there. A portrait of [[Napoleon]] from 1807 by [[Louis-Andr\u00e9-Gabriel Bouchet]] and one of his wife [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Jos\u00e9phine]] from 1805 by [[Robert Lef\u00e8vre]] are viewable as part of the tour. \n \n As before, the city hall is the seat of the mayor of Aachen and of the city council, and annually the [[Charlemagne Prize]] is awarded there. \n \n === Other sights === \n The ''Grashaus'', a late medieval house at the ''Fischmarkt'', is one of the oldest non-religious buildings in central Aachen. It hosted the city archive, and before that, the Grashaus was the city hall until the present building took over this function. \n \n The ''Elisenbrunnen'' is one of the most famous sights of Aachen. It is a neo-classical hall covering one of the city's famous fountains. It is just a minute away from the cathedral. Just a few steps in a south-easterly direction lies the 19th-century [[Theater Aachen|theatre]]. \n \n Also of note are two remaining city gates, the ''[[Ponttor]]'' (Pont gate), {{convert|1/2|mi|m|order=flip|abbr=off}} northwest of the cathedral, and the ''Marschiertor'' (marching gate), close to the central railway station. There are also a few parts of both medieval city walls left, most of them integrated into more recent buildings, but some others still visible. There are even five towers left, some of which are used for housing. \n \n [[St. Michael's Church, Aachen]] was built as a church of the Aachen [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Collegium in 1628. It is attributed to the Rhine [[mannerism]], and a sample of a local [[Renaissance architecture]]. The rich fa\u00e7ade remained unfinished until 1891, when the architect Peter Friedrich Peters added to it. The church is a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] church today, but the building is used also for concerts because of its good acoustics. \n \n The synagogue in Aachen, which was destroyed on the [[Night of Broken Glass]] ([[Kristallnacht]]), 9 November 1938, was reinaugurated on 18 May 1995. < ref > {{harvnb|American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|2013}}. < /ref > < ref > {{harvnb|Knufinke|2013}}. < /ref >  One of the contributors to the reconstructions of the synagogue was [[J\u00fcrgen Linden]], the Lord Mayor of Aachen from 1989 to 2009. \n \n There are numerous other notable churches and [[monastery|monasteries]], a few remarkable 17th- and 18th-century buildings in the particular [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style typical of the region, a synagogue, a collection of statues and monuments, park areas, cemeteries, among others.

[[Intercity-Express|ICE high speed trains]] from [[Brussels]] via [[Cologne]] to [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Thalys]] trains from Paris to Cologne also stop at Aachen Central Station. Four [[Regional-Express|RE]] lines and two [[Regionalbahn|RB]] lines connect Aachen with the [[Ruhr]]gebiet, M\u00f6nchengladbach, Spa (Belgium), [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and the [[Siegerland]]. The ''[[Euregiobahn]]'', a regional railway system, reaches several minor cities in the Aachen region. \n \n There are four smaller stations in Aachen: ''[[Aachen West station|Aachen West]]'', ''[[Aachen Schanz station|Aachen Schanz]]'', ''[[Aachen-Rothe Erde station|Aachen-Rothe Erde]]'' and ''[[Eilendorf station|Eilendorf]]''. Slower trains stop at these. Aachen West has gained in importance with the expansion of [[RWTH Aachen University]]. \n \n ===Intercity bus stations=== \n There are two stations for [[intercity bus service]]s in Aachen: [[Aachen West station]], in the north-west of the city, and Aachen Wilmersdorfer Stra\u00dfe, in the north-east. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/aachen|last=Travelinho|title=Aachen: Stations|access-date=10 February 2019|archive-date=1 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301054922/http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/aachen|url-status=dead}} < /ref > \n \n === Public transport === \n [[File:OecherLongWajong1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bi-articulated bus]] of the city's transit authority ASEAG, at the [[Klinikum Aachen|university hospital]] bus stop]] \n \n The first horse tram line in Aachen opened in December 1880. After electrification in 1895, it attained a maximum length of {{convert|213.5|km|mi|frac=8|abbr=off}} in 1915, becoming the fourth-longest tram network in Germany. Many tram lines extended to the surrounding towns of [[Herzogenrath]], [[Stolberg (Rheinland)|Stolberg]], [[Alsdorf]] as well as the Belgian and Dutch communes of [[Vaals]], [[Kelmis]] (then ''Altenberg'') and [[Eupen]]. The Aachen tram system was linked with the [[Vicinal tramway|Belgian national interurban tram system]]. Like many tram systems in Western Europe, the Aachen tram suffered from poorly-maintained infrastructure and was so deemed unnecessary and disrupting for car drivers by local politics. On 28 September 1974 the last line 15 (Vaals\u2013Brand) operated for one last day and was then replaced by buses. A proposal to reinstate a tram/light rail system under the name ''Campusbahn'' was dropped after a referendum. \n \n Today, the ASEAG (''Aachener Stra\u00dfenbahn und Energieversorgungs-AG'', literally  \" Aachen tram and power supply company \" ) operates a {{convert|1240.8|km|mi|adj=mid|-long|frac=8}} bus network with 68 bus routes. Because of the location at the border, many bus routes extend to Belgium and the Netherlands. Lines 14 to Eupen, Belgium and 44 to Heerlen, Netherlands are jointly operated with [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 R\u00e9gionale Wallonne du Transport|Transport en Commun]] and [[Veolia Transport Nederland]], respectively. ASEAG is one of the main participants in the Aachener Verkehrsverbund (AVV), a tariff association in the region. Along with ASEAG, city bus routes of Aachen are served by private contractors such as Sadar, Taeter, Schl\u00f6mer, or [[DB Regio Bus]]. Line 350, which runs from [[Maastricht]], also enters Aachen. \n \n === Roads === \n Aachen is connected to the [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] (west-east), [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]] (north-south) and A544 (a smaller motorway from the A4 to the ''Europaplatz'' near the city centre). There are plans to eliminate traffic jams at the Aachen road interchange. \n \n === Airport === \n [[Maastricht Aachen Airport]] {{airport codes|MST|EHBK}} is the main airport of Aachen and [[Maastricht]]. It is located around 15 nautical miles (28 & nbsp;km; 17 & nbsp;mi) northwest of Aachen. There is a shuttle-service between Aachen and the airport. \n \n Recreational aviation is served by the (formerly military) [[Aachen Merzbr\u00fcck Airfield]]. \n \n == Charlemagne Prize == \n {{main|Charlemagne Prize}} \n [[File:Angela Merkel, Karlspreisverleihung 2008 - 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]], wearing the Charlemagne Prize awarded to her in 2008]] \n \n Since 1950, a committee of Aachen citizens annually awards the Charlemagne Prize ({{lang-de|link=no|Karlspreis}}) to personalities of outstanding service to the unification of Europe. It is traditionally awarded on [[Ascension Day]] at the [[Aachen Rathaus|City Hall]]. In 2016, the Charlemagne Award was awarded to [[Pope Francis]]. \n \n The International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen was awarded in the year 2000 to US president [[Bill Clinton]], for his special personal contribution to co-operation with the states of Europe, for the preservation of peace, freedom, democracy and [[human rights in Europe]], and for his support of the enlargement of the European Union. In 2004, [[Pope John Paul II]]'s efforts to unite Europe were honoured with an  \" Extraordinary Charlemagne Medal \" , which was awarded for the only time ever. \n \n ==Notable people== \n
