He founded the religion of [[Thelema]], identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the [[\u00c6on of Horus]] in the early 20th century. A prolific writer, he published widely over the course of his life. \n \n Born to a wealthy family in [[Royal Leamington Spa]], [[Warwickshire]], Crowley rejected his parents' [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] [[Plymouth Brethren]] faith to pursue an interest in [[Western esotericism]]. He was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry, resulting in several publications. Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a [[British intelligence agency]], further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life. In 1898, he joined the esoteric [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], where he was trained in ceremonial magic by [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]] and [[Charles Henry Allan Bennett|Allan Bennett]]. Moving to [[Boleskine House]] by [[Loch Ness]] in Scotland, he went mountaineering in Mexico with [[Oscar Eckenstein]], before studying [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] practices in India. He married [[Rose Edith Kelly]] and in 1904 they honeymooned in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], where Crowley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named [[Aiwass]], who provided him with ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', a sacred text that served as the basis for Thelema. Announcing the start of the \u00c6on of Horus, ''The Book'' declared that its followers should  \" Do what thou wilt \"  and seek to align themselves with their [[True Will]] through the practice of [[Magick (Thelema)|magick]]. \n \n After [[1905 Kanchenjunga expedition|an unsuccessful attempt to climb Kanchenjunga]] and a visit to India and China, Crowley returned to Britain, where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry, novels, and occult literature. In 1907, he and [[George Cecil Jones]] co-founded an esoteric order, the [[A\u2234A\u2234]], through which they propagated Thelema. After spending time in Algeria, in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order, the German-based [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.), rising to become the leader of its British branch, which he reformulated in accordance with his Thelemite beliefs. Through the O.T.O., Thelemite groups were established in Britain, Australia, and North America. Crowley spent the [[First World War]] in the United States, where he took up painting and campaigned for the German war effort against Britain, later revealing that he had infiltrated the pro-German movement to assist the British intelligence services. In 1920, he established the [[Abbey of Thelema]], a religious commune in [[Cefal\u00f9]], Sicily where he lived with various followers. His [[libertine]] lifestyle led to denunciations in the British press, and the Italian government evicted him in 1923. He divided the following two decades between France, Germany, and England, and continued to promote Thelema until his death. \n \n Crowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime, being a [[recreational drug]] experimenter, [[bisexual]], and an individualist [[social critic]]. Crowley has remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the [[counterculture]] and continues to be considered a prophet in Thelema. He is the subject of various biographies and academic studies. \n \n ==Early life== \n \n ===Youth: 1875\u20131894=== \n [[File:Aleister Crowley birthplace.jpg|thumb|alt=2017 photograph of Crowley's birthplace|Aleister Crowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875.]] \n \n Crowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in [[Royal Leamington Spa]], Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=4\u20135|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=15|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=14}} His father, Edward Crowley (1829\u20131887), was trained as an engineer, but his share in a lucrative family brewing business, Crowley's Alton Ales, had allowed him to retire before his son was born.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=2\u20133|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=31\u201323|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=4\u20138|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=14\u201315}} His mother, Emily Bertha Bishop (1848\u20131917), came from a Devonshire-Somerset family and had a strained relationship with her son; she described him as  \" the Beast \" , a name that he revelled in.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=3|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=18\u201321|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=13\u201316|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=17\u201321}} The couple had been married at London's [[Kensington and Chelsea Register Office|Kensington Registry Office]] in November 1874,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=3|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=13\u201314|3a1=Churton|3y=2011|3p=17}} and were evangelical Christians. Crowley's father had been born a [[Quaker]], but had converted to the [[Exclusive Brethren]], a faction of a [[Christian fundamentalist]] group known as the [[Plymouth Brethren]], with Emily joining him upon marriage. Crowley's father was particularly devout, spending his time as a travelling preacher for the sect and reading a chapter from the Bible to his wife and son after breakfast every day.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=3\u20134, 6, 9\u201310|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=17\u201323|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=11\u201312, 16}} Following the death of their baby daughter in 1880, in 1881 the Crowleys moved to [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], Surrey.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=6\u20137|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=16|3a1=Churton|3y=2011|3p=24}} At the age of 8, Crowley was sent to H.T.

Crowley developed interests in [[chess]], poetry, and [[mountain climbing]], and in 1894 climbed [[Beachy Head]] before visiting the [[Alps]] and joining the [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]]. The following year he returned to the [[Bernese Alps]], climbing the [[Eiger]], [[Trift Glacier|Trift]], [[Jungfrau]], [[M\u00f6nch]], and [[Wetterhorn]].{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=39\u201343|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=30\u201332, 34|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=27\u201330|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=26\u201327}} \n \n ===Cambridge University: 1895\u20131898=== \n Having adopted the name of Aleister over Edward, in October 1895 Crowley began a three-year course at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was entered for the [[Human science|Moral Science]] [[Tripos]] studying philosophy.

These feats led to his recognition in the Alpine mountaineering community.{{sfnm|1a1=Symonds|1y=1997|1p=13|2a1=Booth|2y=2000|2pp=53\u201356|3a1=Sutin|3y=2000|3pp=50\u201352|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4p=35, 42\u201345, 50\u201351|5a1=Churton|5y=2011|5p=35}} \n \n {{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=For many years I had loathed being called Alick, partly because of the unpleasant sound and sight of the word, partly because it was the name by which my mother called me.

I had read in some book or other that the most favourable name for becoming famous was one consisting of a [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]] followed by a [[spondee]], as at the end of a [[hexameter]]: like ''Jeremy Taylor''.

Developing a love of the country, he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic, working with [[John Dee]]'s [[Enochian]] invocations. He later claimed to have been initiated into [[Freemasonry]] while there, and he wrote a play based on [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]'' as well as a series of poems, published as ''Oracles'' (1905). Eckenstein joined him later in 1900, and together they climbed several mountains, including [[Iztaccihuatl]], [[Popocat\u00e9petl|Popocatepetl]], and [[Volc\u00e1n de Colima|Colima]], the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=127\u201337|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=80\u201386|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=83\u201390|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=64\u201370}} Leaving Mexico, Crowley headed to San Francisco before sailing for Hawaii aboard the ''Nippon Maru''. On the ship, he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers; saying he had fallen in love with her, he wrote a series of poems about the romance, published as ''Alice: An Adultery'' (1903).{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=137\u201339|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=86\u201390|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=90\u201393|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=71\u201375}} \n \n [[File:Aleister Crowley 1902 K2.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Crowley bathing in a spring during the K2 Expedition|Crowley during the K2 Expedition]] \n Briefly stopping in Japan and Hong Kong, Crowley reached Ceylon, where he met with Allan Bennett, who was there studying [[Shaivism]]. The pair spent some time in [[Kandy]] before Bennett decided to become a Buddhist monk in the [[Theravada]] tradition, travelling to Burma to do so.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=139\u201344|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=90\u201395|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=93\u201396|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=76\u201378}} Crowley decided to tour India, devoting himself to the Hindu practice of ''[[R\u0101ja yoga]]'', from which he claimed to have achieved the spiritual state of ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]]''. He spent much of this time studying at the [[Meenakshi Temple]] in [[Madurai|Madura]]. At this time he also wrote poetry which was published as ''The Sword of Song'' (1904). He contracted [[malaria]], and had to recuperate from the disease in Calcutta and Rangoon.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=144\u201347|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=94\u201398|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=96\u201398|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=78\u201383}} In 1902, he was joined in India by Eckenstein and several other mountaineers: Guy Knowles, H. Pfannl, V. Wesseley, and [[Jules Jacot-Guillarmod]]. Together, the Eckenstein-Crowley expedition attempted [[K2]], which had never been climbed. On the journey, Crowley was afflicted with [[influenza]], malaria, and [[snow blindness]], and other expedition members were also struck with illness. They reached an altitude of {{convert|20000|ft|m}} before turning back.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=148\u201356|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=98\u2013104|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=98\u2013108|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=83}} \n \n Having arrived in Paris in November 1902, he socialised with friend and future brother-in-law, the painter [[Gerald Festus Kelly|Gerald Kelly]], and through him became a fixture of the Parisian arts scene. Whilst there, Crowley wrote a series of poems on the work of an acquaintance, the sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]]. These poems were later published as ''Rodin in Rime'' (1907).{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=159\u201363|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=104\u201308|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=109\u201315|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=84\u201386}} One of those frequenting this milieu was [[W.

In August, Crowley wed Gerald's sister [[Rose Edith Kelly]] in a  \" marriage of convenience \"  to prevent her from entering an [[arranged marriage]]; the marriage appalled the Kelly family and damaged his friendship with Gerald. Heading on a honeymoon to Paris, Cairo, and then Ceylon, Crowley fell in love with Rose and worked to prove his affections. While on his honeymoon, he wrote her a series of love poems, published as ''Rosa Mundi and other Love Songs'' (1906), as well as authoring the religious satire ''Why Jesus Wept'' (1904).{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=171\u201377|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=110\u201316|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=119\u201324|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=89\u201390}} \n \n ==Developing Thelema== \n \n ===Egypt and ''The Book of the Law'': 1904=== \n {{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Had!

Claiming to be a prince and princess, they rented an apartment in which Crowley set up a temple room and began invoking ancient Egyptian deities, while studying [[Islam]]ic [[mysticism]] and [[Arabic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=181\u201382|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=118\u201320|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=124|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=94}} According to Crowley's later account, Rose regularly became delirious and informed him  \" they are waiting for you. \"  On 18 March, she explained that  \" they \"  were the god [[Horus]], and on 20 March proclaimed that  \" the Equinox of the Gods has come \" . She led him to a nearby museum, where she showed him a seventh-century BCE mortuary [[stele]] known as the [[Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu]]; Crowley thought it important that the exhibit's number was 666, the [[Number of the beast|Number of the Beast]] in Christian belief, and in later years termed the artefact the  \" Stele of Revealing. \" {{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=182\u201383|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=120\u201322|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=124\u201326|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=96\u201398}} \n \n According to Crowley's later statements, on 8 April he heard a disembodied voice that claimed to be that of [[Aiwass]], the messenger of Horus, or [[Heru-ra-ha|Hoor-Paar-Kraat]]. Crowley said that he wrote down everything the voice told him over the course of the next three days, and titled it ''Liber AL vel Legis'' or ''[[The Book of the Law]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=184\u201388|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=122\u201325|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=127\u201329}} The book proclaimed that humanity was entering a new [[Aeon (Thelema)|Aeon]], and that Crowley would serve as its [[prophet]]. It stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this Aeon,  \" Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law, \"  and that people should learn to live in tune with their Will. This book, and the philosophy that it espoused, became the cornerstone of Crowley's religion, [[Thelema]].{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=184\u201388|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=125\u201333}} Crowley said that at the time he had been unsure what to do with ''The Book of the Law''. Often resenting it, he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform, which included taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum, fortifying his own island, and translating the book into all the world's languages. According to his account, he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew, putting the manuscript away and ignoring it.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=188|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=139|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=129}} \n \n ===Kanchenjunga and China: 1905\u201306=== \n Returning to Boleskine, Crowley came to believe that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and the relationship between the two broke down.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=189, 194\u201395|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=140\u201341|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=130|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=108}} On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley's first child, a daughter named Lilith, with Crowley writing the pornographic ''[[Snowdrops from a Curate's Garden]]'' to entertain his recuperating wife.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=195\u201396|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=142|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=132|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=108}} He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]]. Among its first publications were Crowley's ''Collected Works'', edited by Ivor Back, an old friend of Crowley's who was both a practicing surgeon and an enthusiast of literature.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=190|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=142|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=131\u201333}} His poetry often received strong reviews (either positive or negative), but never sold well. In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of \u00a3100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was [[J. F. C. Fuller]], a British Army officer and military historian, whose essay, ''The Star in the West'' (1907), heralded Crowley's poetry as some of the greatest ever written.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=241\u201342|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=177\u201379|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=136\u201337, 139, 168\u201369}} \n \n [[File:Kanchenjunga India.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A photograph of Kangchenjunga|[[Kangchenjunga|Kanchenjunga]], as seen from [[Darjeeling]]]] \n \n Crowley decided to climb [[Kangchenjunga|Kanchenjunga]] in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely recognised as the world's most treacherous mountain. The collaboration between [[Jules Jacot-Guillarmod|Jacot-Guillarmod]], Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, [[1905 Kanchenjunga expedition|the expedition]] was marred by much argument between Crowley and the others, who thought that he was reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings that it was too dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=201\u201315|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=149\u201358|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=138\u201349|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=111\u201312}} \n \n Spending time in [[Hariharpur, India|Moharbhanj]], where he took part in [[big-game hunting]] and wrote the homoerotic work ''The Scented Garden'', Crowley met up with Rose and Lilith in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] before being forced to leave India after non-lethally shooting two men who tried to mug him.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=217\u201319|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=158\u201362|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=151\u201352}} Briefly visiting Bennett in Burma, Crowley and his family decided to tour Southern China, hiring porters and a nanny for the purpose.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=221|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=162\u201363|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=114}} Crowley smoked opium throughout the journey, which took the family from [[Tengchong|Tengyueh]] through to Yungchang, [[Dali, Yunnan|Tali]], [[Kunming|Yunnanfu]], and then [[Hanoi]]. On the way, he spent much time on spiritual and magical work, reciting the  \" Bornless Ritual \" , an invocation to his [[Holy Guardian Angel]], on a daily basis.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=221\u201332|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=164\u201369|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=153\u201354|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=115\u201318}} \n \n While Rose and Lilith returned to Europe, Crowley headed to Shanghai to meet old friend Elaine Simpson, who was fascinated by ''The Book of the Law''; together they performed rituals in an attempt to contact Aiwass.

Crowley convinced Reuss that the similarities were coincidental, and the two became friends. Reuss appointed Crowley as head of the O.T.O's British branch, the Mysteria Mystica Maxima (MMM), and at a ceremony in [[Berlin]] Crowley adopted the magical name of [[Baphomet]] and was proclaimed  \" X\u00b0 Supreme Rex and Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland, Iona, and all the Britons \" .{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=302\u201305|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=225\u201326|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=251\u201325}} With Reuss' permission, Crowley set about advertising the MMM and re-writing many O.T.O. rituals, which were then based largely on [[Freemasonry]]; his incorporation of Thelemite elements proved controversial in the group. Fascinated by the O.T.O's emphasis on [[sex magic]], Crowley devised a magical working based on anal sex and incorporated it into the syllabus for those O.T.O. members who had been initiated into the [[Ordo Templi Orientis#Initiation and teachings|eleventh degree]].{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=306|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=228|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=256}} \n \n In March 1913, Crowley acted as producer for ''The Ragged Ragtime Girls'', a group of female violinists led by Waddell, as they performed at London's [[Old Tivoli]] theatre.

He believed that this Aeon follows on from the Aeon of Osiris, in which paternalistic religions like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism dominated the world, and that this in turn had followed the Aeon of Isis, which had been maternalistic and dominated by goddess worship.{{sfnm|1a1=Drury|1y=2012|1p=210|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=3}} He believed that Thelema was the proper religion of the Aeon of Horus,{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=88}} and also deemed himself to be the prophet of this new Aeon.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=51}} Thelema revolves around the idea that human beings each have their own True Will that they should discover and pursue, and that this exists in harmony with the Cosmic Will that pervades the universe.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=Drury|2y=2012|2p=209}} Crowley referred to this process of searching and discovery of one's True Will to be  \" the Great Work \"  or the attaining of the  \" knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel \" .{{sfn|Asprem|2013|pp=88\u201389}} His favoured method of doing so was through the performance of the Abramelin operation, a ceremonial magic ritual obtained from a 17th-century grimoire.{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=89}} The moral code of  \" Do What Thou Wilt \"  is believed by Thelemites to be the religion's ethical law, although the historian of religion Marco Pasi noted that this was not [[anarchism|anarchistic]] or [[libertarianism|libertarian]] in structure, as Crowley saw individuals as part of a wider societal organism.{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=49}} \n \n ===Magick and theology=== \n Crowley believed in the objective existence of [[magic (supernatural)|magic]], which he chose to spell  \" Magick \" , an older archaic spelling of the word.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=Asprem|2y=2013|2p=89|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=4}} He provided various different definitions of this term over his career.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} In his book ''Magick in Theory and Practice'', Crowley defined Magick as  \" the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will \" .{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=DuQuette|2y=2003|2p=11|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=4}} He also told his disciple Karl Germer that  \" Magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours. Mysticism is the raising of oneself to their level. \" {{sfn|Churton|2011|p=417}} Crowley saw Magick as a third way between religion and science, giving ''The Equinox'' the subtitle of ''The Method of Science; the Aim of Religion''.{{sfnm|1a1=Asprem|1y=2008|1p=140|2a1=Bogdan|2a2=Starr|2y=2012|2p=4}} Within that journal he expressed positive sentiments toward science and the [[scientific method]],{{sfn|Asprem|2008|p=150}} and urged magicians to keep detailed records of their magical experiments,  \" The more scientific the record is, the better. \" {{sfn|Asprem|2008|pp=151\u201352}} His understanding of magic was also influenced by the work of the anthropologist James Frazer, in particular the view that magic was a precursor to science in a [[cultural evolution]]ary framework.{{sfn|Asprem|2008|pp=145, 149}} Unlike Frazer, however, Crowley did not see magic as a survival from the past that required eradication, but rather he believed that magic had to be adapted to suit the new age of science.{{sfn|Asprem|2008|p=150}} In Crowley's alternative schema, old systems of ''magic'' had to decline (per Frazer's framework) so that science and magic could synthesize into ''magick'', which would simultaneously accept the existence of the supernatural and an [[experiment|experimental method]].{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=170}} Crowley deliberately adopted an exceptionally broad definition of magick that included almost all forms of technology as magick, adopting an [[Instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] interpretation of magic, science, and technology.{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=172\u201373}} \n \n {{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote= \" To [Crowley] the greatest aim of the magician was to merge with a higher power connected to the wellsprings of the universe, but he did not trouble himself too much to define that power consistently; sometimes it was God, sometimes the One, sometimes a goddess, and sometimes one's own Holy Guardian Angel or higher self. In the last analysis he was content for the nature of divinity to remain a mystery.

The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] noted that some of Crowley's writings could be used to argue that he was an [[atheism|atheist]],{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} while some support the idea that he was a [[polytheism|polytheist]],{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZOzDwAAQBAJ & pg=PA185 185]}} and others would bolster the idea that he was a [[mysticism|mystical]] [[monotheism|monotheist]].{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=176}} On the basis of the teachings in ''The Book of the Law'', Crowley described a pantheon of three deities taken from the ancient Egyptian pantheon: Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=178}} In 1928, he made the claim that all  \" true \"  deities were  \" derived \"  from this trinity.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=178}} [[Jason Josephson-Storm]] has argued that Crowley built on 19th-century attempts to [[Jesus in comparative mythology|link early Christianity to pre-Christian religions]], such as Frazer's ''Golden Bough'', to synthesize Christian theology and Neopaganism while remaining critical of institutional and traditional Christianity.{{sfn|Josephson-Storm|2017|p=165}} \n \n Both during his life and after it, Crowley has been widely described as a [[Satanism|Satanist]], usually by detractors. Crowley stated he did not consider himself a Satanist, nor did he worship [[Satan]], as he did not accept the Christian world view in which Satan was believed to exist.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=175|2a1=Dyrendal|2y=2012|2pp=369\u201370}} He nevertheless used Satanic imagery, for instance by describing himself as  \" the Beast 666 \"  and referring to the [[Whore of Babylon]] in his work, while in later life he sent  \" [[Christmas card|Antichristmas cards]] \"  to his friends.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=175}} In his writings, Crowley occasionally identified Aiwass as Satan and designated him as  \" Our Lord God the Devil \"  at one occasion.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=309}} The scholar of religion Gordan Djurdjevic stated that Crowley  \" was emphatically not \"  a Satanist,  \" if for no other reason than simply because he did not identify himself as such \" .{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=58}} Crowley nevertheless expressed strong anti-Christian sentiment,{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=176|2a1=Hedenborg White|2y=2020|2p=45}} stating that he hated Christianity  \" as Socialists hate soap \" ,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=176}} an animosity probably stemming from his experiences among the Plymouth Brethren.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=175}} He was nevertheless influenced by the [[King James Bible]], especially the [[Book of Revelation]], the impact of which can be seen in his writings.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=39}} He was also accused of advocating [[human sacrifice]], largely because of a passage in ''Book 4'' in which he stated that  \" A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory victim \"  and added that he had sacrificed about 150 every year. This was a tongue-in-cheek reference to [[ejaculation]], something not realised by his critics.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=120\u201321}} \n \n ==Personal life== \n Crowley considered himself to be one of the outstanding figures of his time.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=172}} The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] stated that in Crowley's youth, he was  \" a self-indulgent and flamboyant young man \"  who  \" set about a deliberate flouting and provocation of social and religious norms \" , while being shielded from an  \" outraged public opinion \"  by his inherited wealth.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=172}} Hutton also described Crowley as having both an  \" unappeasable desire \"  to take control of any organisation that he belonged to, and  \" a tendency to quarrel savagely \"  with those who challenged him.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=172}} Crowley biographer [[Martin Booth]] asserted that Crowley was  \" self-confident, brash, eccentric, egotistic, highly intelligent, arrogant, witty, wealthy, and, when it suited him, cruel \" .{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=125}} Similarly, Richard B. Spence noted that Crowley was  \" capable of immense physical and emotional cruelty \" .{{sfn|Spence|2008|p=10}} Biographer [[Lawrence Sutin]] noted that Crowley exhibited  \" courage, skill, dauntless energy, and remarkable focus of will \"  while at the same time showing a  \" blind arrogance, petty fits of bile, [and] contempt for the abilities of his fellow men \" .{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=148}} The Thelemite [[Lon Milo DuQuette]] noted that Crowley  \" was by no means perfect \"  and  \" often alienated those who loved him dearest. \" {{sfn|DuQuette|2003|p=9}} \n \n ===Political views=== \n Crowley enjoyed being outrageous and flouting conventional morality,{{sfn|Moore|2009|p=33}} with [[John Symonds]] noting that he  \" was in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time \" .{{sfn|Symonds|1997|p=vii}} Crowley's political thought was studied by academic Marco Pasi, who noted that for Crowley, socio-political concerns were subordinate to metaphysical and spiritual ones.{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=23}} He was neither on the political [[Left-wing politics|left]] nor [[Right-wing politics|right]] but perhaps best categorised as a  \" conservative revolutionary \"  despite not being affiliated with the German-based [[conservative revolutionary movement]].{{sfn|Pasi|2014|pp=49\u201350}} Pasi described Crowley's affinity to the extreme ideologies of [[Nazism]] and [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], which aimed to violently overturn society:  \" What Crowley liked about Nazism and communism, or at least what made him curious about them, was the anti-Christian position and the revolutionary and socially subversive implications of these two movements. In their subversive powers, he saw the possibility of an annihilation of old religious traditions, and the creation of a void that Thelema, subsequently, would be able to fill. \" {{sfn|Pasi|2014|pp=52\u201353}} Crowley described democracy as an  \" imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness \" ,{{sfn|Morgan|2011|p=166}} and commented that ''The Book of the Law'' proclaimed that  \" there is the master and there is the slave; the noble and the serf; the 'lone wolf' and the herd \" .{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=49}} In this attitude he was influenced by the work of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and by [[Social Darwinism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Sutin|1y=2000|1p=129|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2p=401|3a1=Pasi|3y=2014|3p=48}} Although he had contempt for most of the British aristocracy, he regarded himself as an aristocrat and styled himself as Laird Boleskine,{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=109}} once describing his ideology as  \" aristocratic communism \" .{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=50}} \n \n ===Views on race and gender=== \n Crowley was bisexual, and exhibited a sexual preference for women,{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=Booth|2y=2000|2p=67|3a1=Spence|3y=2008|3p=19}} with his relationships with men being fewer and clustered in the early part of his life.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} In particular he had an attraction toward  \" exotic women \" ,{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=130}} and claimed to have fallen in love on multiple occasions; Kaczynski stated that  \" when he loved, he did so with his whole being, but the passion was typically short-lived \" .{{sfn|Kaczynski|2010|p=91}} Even in later life, Crowley was able to attract young bohemian women to be his lovers, largely due to his charisma.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=350}} He applied the term  \" Scarlet Woman \"  to various female lovers whom he believed played an important role in his magical work.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=94}} During homosexual [[anal sex|anal intercourse]], he usually played the passive role,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=63|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=159}} which Booth believed  \" appealed to his masochistic side \" .{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=63}} An underlying theme in many of his writings is that spiritual enlightenment arises through transgressing socio-sexual norms.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=48}} \n \n Crowley advocated complete sexual freedom for both men and women.{{sfn|Hedenborg White|2020|p=104}} He argued that homosexual and bisexual people should not suppress their sexual orientation,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} commenting that a person  \" must not be ashamed or afraid of being homosexual if he happens to be so at heart; he must not attempt to violate his own true nature because of public opinion, or medieval morality, or religious prejudice which would wish he were otherwise. \" {{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=128}} On other issues he adopted a more conservative attitude;

After his time in Cefal\u00f9 which had brought him to public attention in Britain, various  \" literary Crowleys \"  appeared; characters in fiction based upon him.{{sfn|Freeman|2018|p=103}} One of the earliest was the character of the poet Shelley Arabin in [[John Buchan]]'s 1926 novel ''[[The Dancing Floor]]''.{{sfn|Freeman|2018|p=103}} In his novel ''[[The Devil Rides Out]]'', the writer [[Dennis Wheatley]] used Crowley as a partial basis for the character of Damien Morcata, a portly bald defrocked priest who engages in black magic.{{sfn|Freeman|2018|pp=106\u201307}} The occultist [[Dion Fortune]] used Crowley as a basis for characters in her books ''The Secrets of Doctor Taverner'' (1926) and ''The Winged Bull'' (1935).{{sfn|Freeman|2018|p=105}} He was included as one of the figures on the cover art of [[The Beatles]]' album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967),{{sfn|Bogdan|Starr|2012|p=7}} and his motto of  \" Do What Thou Wilt \"  was inscribed on the vinyl of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s album ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' (1970).{{sfn|Bogdan|Starr|2012|p=7}} Led Zeppelin co-founder [[Jimmy Page]] bought Boleskine in 1971, and part of the band's film ''[[The Song Remains the Same (film)|The Song Remains the Same]]'' was filmed in the grounds. He sold it in 1992.{{sfn|The Newsroom|2007}} Though [[David Bowie]] makes but a fleeting reference to Crowley in the lyrics of his song  \" [[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]] \"  (1971),{{sfn|Bogdan|Starr|2012|p=7}} it has been suggested that the lyrics of Bowie's No. 1 hit single  \" [[Let's Dance (David Bowie song)|Let's Dance]] \"  (1983) may substantially paraphrase Crowley's 1923 poem  \" Lyric of Love to Leah \" .{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=368}} [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and his lyricist [[Bob Daisley]] wrote a song titled  \" [[Mr. Crowley]] \"  (1980).{{sfnm|1a1=Moreman|1y=2003|1p=1|2a1=Granholm|2y=2013|2p=13}}  < !-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER INSTANCES OF CROWLEYAN INFLUENCE ON POPULAR CULTURE UNLESS YOU HAVE THIRD-PARTY, ACADEMIC REFERENCES TO BOLSTER SUCH STATEMENTS WITH.
