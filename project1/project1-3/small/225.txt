It was one of the first publications to focus solely on [[role-playing game]]s.  \n ==History== \n In 1964, [[Bruce Pelz]] of the [[Los Angeles Science Fiction Society]] (LASFS) began a monthly amateur press association known as ''APA-L''. < ref > {{cite web | url =http://www.lasfsinc.info/index.php?option=com_content & task=view & id=46 & Itemid=136 | title =APA-L | date =2019-01-14 | website =LASFS | publisher =Los Angeles Science Fiction Society | access-date =2019-07-15 }} < /ref >  In 1974, with the publication of ''[[Dungeons  &  Dragons]]'' by [[TSR, Inc.]], articles and comments about the new roleplaying game began to fill the pages of ''APA-L''. Pelz felt the discussion was taking up too much space, < ref > [http://www.arielarchives.com/Brett/magazines/alarumsandexcursions.html Bretts RPG Magazine and Zine Index] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024220743/http://www.arielarchives.com/Brett/magazines/alarumsandexcursions.html |date=October 24, 2006 }}, entry on Alarums  &  Excursions, retrieved September 2007 < /ref >  and he asked Lee Gold to start a new APA that would take this material and focus entirely on roleplaying games. The first issue of ''Alarums and Excursions'' appeared in June 1975, the title taken from an [[Elizabethan drama]] stage direction that moved soldiers across a stage. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/alarums+and+excursions|title=alarums and excursions|work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}} < /ref > \n \n In addition to removing roleplaying games discussion out of ''APA-L'', the initial aim of the publication was to prevent roleplaying games from becoming so divergent that people from different cities couldn't participate in games together. < ref > {{cite news| last= Mason| first= Paul| date= 2012| title= A history of RPGs: Made by fans; played by fans| url = http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/444/350| work         = Transformative Works and Cultures| volume= 11| access-date  = 2016-06-19| issn= 1941-2258| doi= 10.3983/twc.2012.0444}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book| last1= Mason| first1= Paul| date = 2004| title= In Search of the Self: A Survey of the First 25 Years of Anglo-American Role-Playing Game Theory| page= 2| editor1-last = Montola| editor1-first= Markus| editor2-last = Stenros| editor2-first= Jaakko| contribution  = Beyond Role and Play| location= Helsinki| publisher= Ropecon ry| url = https://nordiclarp.org/w/images/8/84/2004-Beyond.Role.and.Play.pdf| access-date  = 2016-06-19| isbn = 952-91-6842-X}} < /ref > \n \n The June 2017 collation of ''Alarums and Excursions'' was #500, with a color cover drawn by [[Lee Moyer]] and printed by [[Rob Heinsoo]]. \n \n ==Contents== \n Each issue is a collection of contributions from different authors, often featuring game design discussions, rules variants, write-ups of game sessions, reviews, and comments on others contributions.  \n \n Although game reports and social reactions are common parts of many ''A & E'' contributions, it has also, over the years, become a testing ground for new ideas on the development of the RPG as a genre and an art form. The idea that role-playing games ''are'' an art form took strong root in this [[zine]], and left a lasting impression on many of the RPG professionals who contributed. The 1992 role-playing game ''[[Over the Edge (role-playing game)|Over the Edge]]'' was inspired by discussions in ''A & E''. < ref > {{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers  &  Dragons: The '90s|publisher=Evil Hat Productions|year=2014|edition=2|volume=3|ISBN=978-1-61317-084-7|p=55}} < /ref > \n \n Over the years, contributors have included: {{div col|colwidth=18em}} \n * [[Wilf K.
