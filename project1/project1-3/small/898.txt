Born and educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play that opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1935. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, ''[[The Fountainhead]]''. In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own [[Objectivist periodicals|periodicals]] and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982. \n \n Rand advocated [[reason]] as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected [[faith]] and religion. She supported [[Rational egoism|rational]] and [[ethical egoism]] and rejected [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]]. In politics, she condemned the [[initiation of force]] as immoral{{sfn|Sciabarra|1995|p=298}}{{sfn|Gotthelf|2000|p=91}} and opposed [[collectivism]], [[statism]], as well as [[anarchism]], instead supporting ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]], which she defined as the system based on recognizing [[individual rights]], including property rights.{{sfn|Gotthelf|2000|pp=91\u201392}} Although she was opposed to [[libertarianism]], seeing the ideology as anarchism, she is often associated with the modern libertarian movement.{{sfn|Sciabarra|1995|pp=266\u2013267}} In art, Rand promoted [[romantic realism]]. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[classical liberals]].{{sfn|O'Neill|1977|pp=18\u201320}}{{sfn|Sciabarra|1995|pp=12, 118}} \n \n Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|pp=117\u2013119}} Although there was some growth of academic interest in her ideas in the early 2000s,{{sfn|Cohen|2001}}{{sfn|Marcus|2009}} academic philosophers have generally ignored or rejected her philosophy due to her polemical approach and lack of methodological rigor.{{sfn|Badhwar|Long|2020}} The [[Objectivist movement]] attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings.{{sfn|Sciabarra|1995|pp=1\u20132}} She has been a significant influence among libertarians and [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]].{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=4}}{{sfn|Gladstein|2009|pp=107\u2013108, 124}} \n \n ==Life== \n \n ===Early life=== \n Rand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum on February 2, 1905, to a [[Russian-Jewish]] bourgeois family living in [[Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=xiii}} She was the eldest of three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum, a pharmacist, and Anna Borisovna (n\u00e9e Kaplan).{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=3\u20135}} Rand later said she found school unchallenging and began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten.{{sfn|Sciabarra|1995|p=68}} At the prestigious {{interlanguage link|Stoiunina Gymnasium|ru|\u0413\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f \u041c. \u041d. \u0421\u0442\u043e\u044e\u043d\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0439}}, her closest friend was [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s younger sister, Olga; the two girls shared an intense interest in politics.{{sfn|Sciabarra|1995|pp=69, 367\u2013368}}{{sfn|Gladstein|2009|p=2}} \n \n She was twelve at the time of the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, during which she favored [[Alexander Kerensky]] over [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II]]. The subsequent [[October Revolution]] and the rule of the [[Bolsheviks]] under [[Vladimir Lenin]] disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed. Her father's business was confiscated, and the family fled to the [[Crimean Peninsula]], which was initially under control of the [[White Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. While in high school there, she concluded that she was an [[atheist]] and valued [[reason]] above any other virtue. After graduating in June 1921, she returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time), where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion nearly starving.{{sfn|Branden|1986|pp=35\u201339}}{{sfn|Britting|2004|pp=14\u201320}} \n \n [[File:Spb 06-2012 University Embankment 06.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Twelve Collegia buildings of Petrograd State University|Rand completed a three-year program at [[Petrograd State University]].]] \n After the Russian Revolution, universities were opened to women, allowing her to be in the first group of women to enroll at [[Petrograd State University]].{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=15}} At the age of 16, she began her studies in the department of [[social pedagogy]], majoring in history.{{sfn|Sciabarra|1995|p=77}} At the university she was introduced to the writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]];{{sfn|Sciabarra|1999|pp=5\u20138}} she came to see their differing views on reality and knowledge as the primary conflict within philosophy. < ref > [[James G.

After complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate,{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=47}}{{sfn|Britting|2004|p=24}} which she did in October 1924.{{sfn|Sciabarra|1999|p=1}} She then studied for a year at the State [[Tekhnikum|Technicum]] for Screen Arts in Leningrad. For an assignment, she wrote an essay about the Polish actress [[Pola Negri]], which became her first published work.{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=49\u201350}} \n \n By this time, she had decided her professional surname for writing would be ''Rand'',{{sfn|Britting|2004|p=33}} possibly because it is graphically similar to a vowelless excerpt {{lang|ru|\u0420\u0437\u043d\u0431}} of her birth surname in [[Cyrillic]] handwriting,{{sfn|Gladstein|2009|p=7}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=55}} and she adopted the first name ''Ayn''.{{efn|Rand said ''Ayn'' was adapted from a [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] name.{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=19, 301}} Some biographical sources question this, suggesting it may come from a nickname based on the [[Hebrew]] word {{lang|he| \u05e2\u05d9\u05df}} (''[[ayin]]'', meaning  \" eye \" ).{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=55\u201357}} Letters from Rand's family do not use such a nickname for her. < ref > Milgram, Shoshana.  \" The Life of Ayn Rand: Writing, Reading, and Related Life Events \" .

She and her husband worked as full-time volunteers for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican [[Wendell Willkie]]. This work led to Rand's first public speaking experiences; she enjoyed fielding sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had viewed pro-Willkie [[newsreels]].{{sfn|Britting|2004|p=57}} This activity brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist [[Henry Hazlitt]], who introduced her to the [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]]. Despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and both of them expressed admiration for her. Mises once referred to Rand as  \" the most courageous man in America \" , a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said  \" man \"  instead of  \" woman \" .{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=114}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|p=249}} Rand also became friends with libertarian writer [[Isabel Paterson]].

It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it.{{sfn|Britting|2004|pp=58\u201361}} While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed the [[amphetamine]] [[Benzedrine]] to fight fatigue.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=85}} The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=89}} Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=178}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=304\u2013305}} \n \n ''The Fountainhead'' became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security.{{sfn|Doherty|2007|p=149}}{{sfn|Branden|1986|pp=180\u2013181}} In 1943, Rand sold the film rights to [[Warner Bros.]] and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay.

She also joined the anti-Communist [[American Writers Association]].{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=100\u2013101, 123}} A visit by Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a falling out between the two when Paterson made comments, which Rand considered rude, to valued political allies.{{sfn|Burns|2009|pp=130\u2013131}}{{sfn|Heller|2009|pp=214\u2013215}} In 1947, during the [[Second Red Scare]], Rand testified as a  \" friendly witness \"  before the United States [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. Rand testified that the 1944 film ''[[Song of Russia]]'' grossly misrepresented conditions in the [[Soviet Union]], portraying life there as much better and happier than it was.{{sfn|Mayhew|2005b|pp=91\u201393, 188\u2013189}} She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but she was not allowed to testify about it.{{sfn|Burns|2009|p=125}} When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations, Rand described the process as  \" futile \" .{{sfn|Mayhew|2005b|p=83}} \n \n After several delays, the [[The Fountainhead (film)|film version]] of ''The Fountainhead'' was released in 1949. Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she  \" disliked the movie from beginning to end \" , and complained about its editing, acting, and other elements.{{sfn|Britting|2004|p=71}} \n \n ===''Atlas Shrugged'' and Objectivism=== \n {{see also|Atlas Shrugged|Objectivism|Objectivist movement}} \n [[File:Famous fantastic mysteries 195306.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Magazine cover shows a shirtless man holding lightning bolts|Rand's novella ''Anthem'' was reprinted in the June 1953 issue of the pulp magazine ''[[Famous Fantastic Mysteries]]''.]] \n Following the publication of ''The Fountainhead'', Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom the book profoundly influenced. In 1951, Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated  \" The Collective \" ) included future [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] [[Alan Greenspan]], a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later [[Nathaniel Branden]]) and his wife [[Barbara Branden|Barbara]], and Barbara's cousin [[Leonard Peikoff]]. Initially the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. She later began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, ''Atlas Shrugged'', as the manuscript was written. In 1954, Rand's close relationship with Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the knowledge of their spouses.{{sfn|Branden|1986|pp=256\u2013264, 331\u2013343}} \n \n ''Atlas Shrugged'', published in 1957, was considered Rand's ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.{{sfn|Sciabarra|1995|p=113}}{{sfn|Mayhew|2005b|p=78}} Rand described the theme of the novel as  \" the role of the mind in man's existence\u2014and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest \" . < ref > Salmieri, Gregory.  \" ''Atlas Shrugged'' on the Role of the Mind in Man's Existence \" . In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2009|p=248}}. < /ref >  It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism]] and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a [[dystopia]]n United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists, and artists respond to a [[welfare state]] government by going on [[Strike action|strike]] and retreating to a hidden valley where they build an independent free economy. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, [[John Galt]], describes the strike as  \" stopping the motor of the world \"  by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation's wealth and achievement. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of [[Mystery fiction|mystery]], romance, and science fiction,{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|p=42}}{{sfn|McConnell|2010|p=507}} and it contains an extended exposition of Objectivism in a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt. < ref > [[Gennady Stolyarov II|Stolyarov II, G.]]  \" The Role and Essence of John Galt's Speech in Ayn Rand's ''Atlas Shrugged'' \" .
