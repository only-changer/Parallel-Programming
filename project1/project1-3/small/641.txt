The program dated back to AOL's early days, when it charged by the hour for access and one of its highest billing services was chat. AOL provided free access to community leaders in exchange for moderating the chat rooms, and this effectively made chat very cheap to operate, and more lucrative than AOL's other services of the era. There were 33,000 community leaders in 1996. < ref name= \" wired1999 \" > {{Cite web|title = Inside AOL's  \" Cyber-Sweatshop \" |url = https://www.wired.com/1999/10/volunteers/|website = WIRED|access-date = February 2, 2016|language=en-US}} < /ref >  All community leaders received hours of training and underwent a probationary period. While most community leaders moderated chat rooms, some ran AOL communities and controlled their layout and design, with as much as 90% of AOL's content being created or overseen by community managers until 1996. < ref name=journal > {{cite journal|title=America Online volunteers: Lessons from an early co-production community|author=Postigo, Hector|date=September 3, 2009|volume=12|issue=5|pages=451\u2013469|journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies|url=https://www.academia.edu/10314787|doi=10.1177/1367877909337858|s2cid=144865243}} < /ref > \n \n By 1996, [[ISP]]s were beginning to charge flat rates for unlimited access, which they could do at a profit because they only provided internet access. Even though AOL would lose money with such a pricing scheme, it was forced by market conditions to offer unlimited access in October 1996. In order to return to profitability, AOL rapidly shifted its focus from content creation to advertising, resulting in less of a need to carefully moderate every forum and chat room to keep users willing to pay by the minute to remain connected. < ref > {{cite book|title=Fools Rush In: Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Unmaking of AOL Time Warner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hhkt_fUrGOkC & q=unlimited|author=Munk, Nina|pages=82\u201388|year=2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn = 9780061743740}} < /ref > \n \n After unlimited access, AOL considered scrapping the program entirely, but continued it with a reduced number of community leaders, with scaled-back roles in creating content. < ref name=journal / >  Although community leaders continued to receive free access, after 1996 they were motivated more by the prestige of the position and the access to moderator tools and restricted areas within AOL. < ref name= \" wired1999 \" / > < ref name=journal / >  By 1999, there were over 15,000 volunteers in the program. < ref > {{cite news|title=Former Volunteers Sue AOL, Seeking Back Pay for Work|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/26/nyregion/former-volunteers-sue-aol-seeking-back-pay-for-work.html|date=May 26, 1999|author=Napoli, Lisa|page=Section B, Page 10}} < /ref > \n \n In May 1999, two former volunteers filed a class-action lawsuit alleging AOL violated the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] by treating volunteers like employees. Volunteers had to apply for the position, commit to working for at least three to four hours a week, fill out timecards and sign a non-disclosure agreement. < ref name= \" priceonomics \" > {{Cite web|title = The Aol Chat Room Monitor Revolt|url = http://priceonomics.com/the-aol-chat-room-monitor-revolt/|website = Priceonomics|access-date = February 2, 2016}} < /ref >  On July 22, AOL ended its youth corps, which consisted of 350 underage community leaders. < ref name= \" wired1999 \" / >  At this time, the [[United States Department of Labor]] began an investigation into the program, but it came to no conclusions about AOL's practices. < ref name= \" priceonomics \"  / > \n \n AOL ended its community leader program on June 8, 2005. The class action lawsuit dragged on for years, even after AOL ended the program and AOL declined as a major internet company.

In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a [[Class action|class action lawsuit]]. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged. \n \n AOL was sued by the [[Ohio Attorney General]] in October 2003 for improper billing practices. The case was settled on June 8, 2005. AOL agreed to resolve any consumer [[Consumer complaint|complaints]] filed with the [[Ohio]] AG's office. In December 2006, AOL agreed to provide [[restitution]] to Florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the [[Florida Attorney General]]. < ref name= \" BBB-AOL \" > {{cite web |url=http://www.dc.bbb.org/report.html?national=Y & compid=2087 |title=AOL |access-date=January 22, 2008 |publisher=[[Better Business Bureau]] |archive-date=July 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718111258/http://www.dc.bbb.org/report.html?national=Y & compid=2087 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > \n \n === Account cancellation === \n Many customers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, the [[New York Attorney General]]'s office began an inquiry of AOL's customer service policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to [[Customer retention|retain]] or  \" save \"  subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers' wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or  \" save \"  half of the people who called to cancel service.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or  \" save \"  percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum  \" save \"  rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers. \n \n On August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25 & nbsp;million to the state of New York and reformed its customer service procedures. Under the agreement, AOL would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus. < ref name= \" BBB-AOL \" / >  However the agreement only covered people in the state of New York. < ref name= \" pcworld.com \" > {{cite magazine| title= The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time| url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125772/worst_products_ever.html | first=Dan |last=Tynan | date= May 26, 2006 |magazine= PCWorld |access-date= April 15, 2012}} < /ref > \n \n On June 13, 2006, Vincent Ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post, < ref > {{cite web |url=http://insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/ |title=Cancelling AOL |publisher=insignificantthoughts.com |date=June 13, 2006 |access-date=November 28, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231075933/http://www.insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/ |archive-date=December 31, 2010 |url-status=dead}} < /ref >  stating he had switched to broadband years earlier. In the recorded phone call, the AOL representative refused to cancel the account unless the 30-year-old Ferrari explained why AOL hours were still being recorded on it. Ferrari insisted that AOL software was not even installed on the computer. When Ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless, the AOL representative asked to speak with Ferrari's father, for whom the account had been set up. The conversation was aired on CNBC. When CNBC reporters tried to have an account on AOL cancelled, they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than 45 minutes to cancel the account. < ref > {{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13447232 |title=How hard can it be to cancel an AOL account? |first=Jane |last=Wells |publisher=CNBC |date=June 21, 2006 |access-date=July 24, 2006 }} < /ref > \n \n On July 19, 2006, AOL's entire [[Customer retention|retention]] manual was released on the Internet. < ref > Popken, Ben.
