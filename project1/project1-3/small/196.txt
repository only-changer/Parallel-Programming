Today, aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker. \n \n ==Etymology and basic philosophy== \n [[File:\u5408\u6c23\u9053.svg|thumb|80px| \" Aikid\u014d \"  written with  \" [[Qi|ki]] \"  in its [[Ky\u016bjitai|old character form]] ]] \n \n The word  \" aikido \"  is formed of three [[kanji]]: \n * {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u5408|\u5408]]}} & nbsp;\u2013 ''ai'' & nbsp;\u2013 harmony, unifying \n * {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}} & nbsp;\u2013 ''ki'' & nbsp;\u2013 energy, spirit \n * {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u9053|\u9053]]}} & nbsp;\u2013 ''d\u014d'' & nbsp;\u2013 way, path \n \n The term ''[[Aiki (martial arts principle)|aiki]]'' does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of [[bud\u014d]]. This has led to many possible interpretations of the word. \n {{lang|ja|\u5408}} is mainly used in compounds to mean 'combine, unite, join together, meet', examples being {{lang|ja|\u5408\u540c}} (combined/united), {{lang|ja|\u5408\u6210}} (composition), {{lang|ja|\u7d50\u5408}} (unite/combine/join together), {{lang|ja|\u9023\u5408}} (union/alliance/association), {{lang|ja|\u7d71\u5408}} (combine/unify), and {{lang|ja|\u5408\u610f}} (mutual agreement). There is an idea of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], {{lang|ja|\u77e5\u308a\u5408\u3046}} (to get to know one another), {{lang|ja|\u8a71\u3057\u5408\u3044}} (talk/discussion/negotiation), and {{lang|ja|\u5f85\u3061\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b}} (meet by appointment). \n \n {{lang|ja|\u6c17}} is often used to describe a feeling or emotive action, as in {{lang|ja|X\u6c17\u304c\u3059\u308b}} ('I feel X', as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning), and {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u6301\u3061}} (feeling/sensation); it is used to mean energy or force, as in {{lang|ja|\u96fb\u6c17}} (electricity) and {{lang|ja|\u78c1\u6c17}} (magnetism); it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things, as in {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u8cea}} (spirit/trait/temperament). The characters aeteological history can be traced back to the much older Chinese character of qi [[Qi|\u6c23]] that is used extensively in [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] and [[Acupuncture|acupunture]]. \n \n The term {{transl|ja|d\u014d}} in Aikido is derived from the word [[Tao]], \u9053 in Chinese, and is found in many other Japanese martial arts such as, [[judo]] and [[kendo]], and in various non-martial arts, such as [[Japanese calligraphy]] ({{transl|ja|shod\u014d}}), [[ikebana|flower arranging]] ({{transl|ja|kad\u014d}}) and [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] ({{transl|ja|chad\u014d or sad\u014d}}). \n \n Therefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the  \" Way of combining forces \"  or  \" Way of unifying energy \" , in which the term ''aiki'' refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia \n  |last         = Pranin \n  |first        = Stanley \n  |title        = Aiki \n  |encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Aikido \n  |year         = 2007 \n  |url          = http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10 \n  |access-date   = 21 August 2007 \n  |archive-url   = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225755/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10 \n  |archive-date  = 26 September 2007 \n  |url-status      = dead \n  |df           = dmy-all \n }} < /ref >  One applies {{transl|ja|aiki}} by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique. \n \n ==History== \n [[File:Morihei Ueshiba 1939.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|left|alt=A middle-aged, mustachioed man in a kimono|Ueshiba in Tokyo in 1939]] \n Aikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba ({{lang|ja|\u690d\u829d \u76db\u5e73}} {{transl|ja|''[[Ueshiba Morihei]]''}}, 1883\u20131969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as {{transl|ja|''\u014csensei''}} (''Great Teacher''). < ref > {{cite encyclopedia \n  |last=Pranin \n  |first=Stanley \n  |title=O-Sensei \n  |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n  |year=2007 \n  |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n  |url-status=dead \n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826175452/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n  |archive-date=26 August 2014 \n }} < /ref >  The term ''aikido'' was coined in the twentieth century. < ref > {{cite book|last=Draeger|first=Donn F.|year=1974|title=Modern Bujutsu  &  Budo \u2013 The Martial Arts and Ways of Japan|location=New York|publisher=Weatherhill|page=137|isbn=0-8348-0351-8}} < /ref >  Ueshiba envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of his martial training, but as an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation.

It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name  \" aikido \" , but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society ({{transl|ja|''[[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]]''}}) was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts. < ref name= \" Aikido \" / > \n \n ===Religious influences=== \n [[File:Onisaburo Deguchi 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Onisaburo Deguchi]] \n After Ueshiba left Hokkaid\u014d in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by [[Onisaburo Deguchi]], the spiritual leader of the [[\u014cmoto-ky\u014d]] religion (a neo-[[Shinto]] movement) in [[Ayabe]]. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia \n  |last=Pranin \n  |first=Stanley \n  |title=Morihei Ueshiba and Onisaburo Deguchi \n  |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n  |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n  |url-status=dead \n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017200533/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n  |archive-date=17 October 2007 \n }} < /ref >  One of the primary features of \u014cmoto-ky\u014d is its emphasis on the attainment of [[utopia]] during one's life. This idea was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker. < ref > {{cite web \n | last = Oomoto Foundation \n | title = The Teachings \n | work = Teachings and Scriptures \n | publisher = Netinformational Commission \n | year = 2007 \n | url = http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html \n | access-date = 14 August 2007 \n | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070813025607/http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html \n | archive-date= 13 August 2007 \n | url-status= live}} < /ref > \n \n In addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist.

This form has the removal of the eight directions denoting the pre and post natal energies of genki \u5143\u6c23(Chinese \u2013 [[Yuanqi|yu\u00e1n ''q\u00ec'']] ) also known in the Art of Aikido as  \" Source energy \" . \n \n The character for {{Lang|ja|ki}} is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as {{Nihongo| \" health \" |\u5143\u6c17|genki}}, or {{Nihongo| \" shyness \" |\u5185\u6c17|uchiki}}. {{Lang|ja|Ki}} has many meanings, including  \" ambience \" ,  \" mind \" ,  \" mood \" , or  \" intention and action \" , however, in traditional martial arts and medicine it is often referred to in its more general terminology as  \" life energy \" . [[Gozo Shioda]]'s [[Yoshinkan]] Aikido, considered one of the  \" hard styles \" , largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to {{Lang|ja|ki}} lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point. < ref name= \" Shugyo \" / >  In later years, Ueshiba's application of {{Lang|ja|ki}} in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel.

[[Koichi Tohei]]'s [[Ki Society]] centers almost exclusively around the study of the [[empirical]] (albeit subjective) experience of {{Lang|ja|ki}}, with students' proficiency in aikido techniques and {{Lang|ja|ki}} development ranked separately. < ref > {{cite web |last=Reed |first=William |title=A Test Worth More than a Thousand Words |year=1997 |url=http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |access-date=11 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619083726/http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |archive-date=19 June 2007 |url-status=dead  }} < /ref > \n \n ==Training== \n In aikido, as in virtually all Japanese [[martial arts]], there are both physical and mental aspects of training.

Good {{Lang|ja|ukemi}} involves attention to the technique, the partner, and the immediate environment\u2014it is considered an active part of the process of learning aikido. The method of falling itself is also important, and is a way for the practitioner to receive an aikido technique safely and minimize risk of injury. \n \n ===Initial attacks=== \n Aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, attacks with intent (such as a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique. < ref name= \" ADS \" / > \n \n Many of the {{Nihongo|strikes|\u6253\u3061|uchi}} of aikido resemble cuts from a [[sword]] or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for [[weapon|armed]] combat. < ref name= \" ADS \" / >  Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches (''[[tsuki]]''), are practiced as thrusts with a [[knife]] or sword. [[Kick]]s are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan. \n \n Some basic strikes include: \n * {{Nihongo|'''Front-of-the-head strike'''|\u6b63\u9762\u6253\u3061|sh\u014dmen'uchi}} is a vertical [[knifehand strike]] to the head. In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the [[maxillary sinus]]. \n * {{Nihongo|'''Side-of-the-head strike'''|\u6a2a\u9762\u6253\u3061|yokomen'uchi}} is a diagonal knifehand strike to the side of the head or neck. \n * {{Nihongo|'''Chest thrust'''|\u80f8\u7a81\u304d|mune-tsuki}} is a [[Punch (strike)|punch]] to the [[torso]]. Specific targets include the [[chest]], [[abdomen]], and [[solar plexus]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo| \" middle-level thrust \" |\u4e2d\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|ch\u016bdan-tsuki}}, or {{Nihongo| \" direct thrust \" |\u76f4\u7a81\u304d|[[choku-tsuki]]}}. \n * {{Nihongo|'''Face thrust'''|\u9854\u9762\u7a81\u304d|ganmen-tsuki}} is a punch to the [[face]], sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo| \" upper-level thrust \" |\u4e0a\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|j\u014ddan-tsuki}}. \n \n Beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and the direction of the movement of force of a hold than it is for a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a [[Katana|weapon]], whereupon a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker while they are grabbing the defender. < ref name= \" ADS \" / >  The following are examples of some basic grabs: \n * {{Nihongo|'''Single-hand grab'''|\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katate-dori}}, when one hand grabs one wrist. \n * {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u8af8\u624b\u53d6\u308a|morote-dori}}, when both hands grab one wrist; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo| \" single hand double-handed grab \" |\u7247\u624b\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katatery\u014dte-dori}} \n * {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u4e21\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dte-dori}}, when both hands grab both wrists; sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo| \" double single-handed grab \" |\u4e21\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkatate-dori}}. \n * {{Nihongo|'''Shoulder grab'''|\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|kata-dori}} when one shoulder is grabbed. \n * {{Nihongo|'''Both-shoulders-grab'''|\u4e21\u80a9\u53d6\u308a|ry\u014dkata-dori}}, when both shoulders are grabbed.

Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (''[[seiza]]''). Techniques where both {{Lang|ja|uke}} and {{Lang|ja|tori}} are standing are called {{Lang|ja|tachi-waza}}, techniques where both start off in {{Lang|ja|seiza}} are called {{Lang|ja|suwari-waza}}, and techniques performed with {{Lang|ja|uke}} standing and {{Lang|ja|tori}} sitting are called {{Lang|ja|hanmi handachi}} ({{lang|ja|\u534a\u8eab\u534a\u7acb}}). < ref name= \" dynamic \" / > \n \n From these few basic techniques, there are numerous of possible implementations.

Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply white and [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belts]] to distinguish {{Lang|ja|kyu}} and {{Lang|ja|dan}} grades, although some use various belt colors. Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another. < ref name= \" ADS \" / >  Some d\u014dj\u014ds have an age requirement before students can take the {{Lang|ja|dan}} rank exam.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} \n \n The uniform worn for practicing aikido (''[[Keikogi|aikid\u014dgi]]'') is similar to the training uniform (''[[keikogi]]'') used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white.

In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with {{Lang|ja|dan}} ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a {{Lang|ja|hakama}} regardless of rank. < ref name= \" ADS \" / > \n \n ==Aikido styles== \n [[Aikido styles]] vary in their intention as due to its holistic nature. The most common differences noted in aikido, when observed externally, relate to the intensity and realism of training. [[Stanley Pranin]] has observed that some criticism may stem from weak attacks from {{Lang|ja|uke}}, allowing for a conditioned response from {{Lang|ja|tori}}, resulting in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners. < ref name= \" Pranin-aikido today \" > {{cite journal| last = Pranin| first = Stanley| title = Aikido Practice Today| journal = Aiki News| volume = 86| publisher = Aiki News| date = Fall 1990| url = http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=123| access-date = 2007-11-02| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071121231252/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=123| archive-date = 2007-11-21| url-status = dead}} < /ref > \n \n To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time, but, in keeping with the core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. [[Shodokan Aikido]] addresses the issue by practicing in a competitive format. < ref name= \" ACE \" / >  Conversely other post-war styles emphasis spiritual development, enlightenment, peace studies, or the study of traditional medicine for health studies. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/?id=3104|title=In response to the articles by Stanley Pranin & nbsp;\u2013 Martial arts in a state of decline?

As a result, strikes to vital points by {{Lang|ja|tori}}, entering ({{Lang|ja|irimi}}) and initiation of techniques by {{Lang|ja|tori}}, the distinction between {{Lang|ja|omote}} (front side) and {{Lang|ja|ura}} (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} \n \n Conversely, some styles of aikido place less importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by Ueshiba. According to Minoru Shibata of ''Aikido Journal'':  < blockquote > \" O-Sensei's aikido was not a continuation and extension of the old and has a distinct discontinuity with past martial and philosophical concepts. \" < ref name= \" Shibata-Dilemma \" > {{cite journal| last = Shibata| first = Minoru J.| title = A Dilemma Deferred: An Identity Denied and Dismissed| journal = Aikido Journal | year = 2007| url = http://members.aikidojournal.com/public/a-dilemma-deferred-an-identity-denied-and-dismissed/| access-date = 2016-03-11| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071121231751/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article?articleID=263| archive-date= 2007-11-21 | url-status= live}} < /ref > < /blockquote >  In other words, aikido practitioners who focus on aikido's roots in traditional ''[[jujutsu]]'' or ''[[kenjutsu]]'' are said to be diverging from what Ueshiba taught, as some critics urge practitioners:  < blockquote > \" [Ueshiba's] transcendence to the spiritual and universal reality were the fundamentals{{sic}} of the paradigm that he demonstrated. \" < ref name= \" Shibata-Dilemma \" / > < /blockquote > \n \n ==References== \n {{Clear}} \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n \n ==External links== \n {{Sister project links|d=Q43114|n=no|b=no|s=no|voy=no|mw=no|species=no|wikt=aikido}} \n < !-- Please see Talk concerning Styles and External Links.
