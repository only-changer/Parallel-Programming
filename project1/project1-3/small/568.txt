Perseus kills the monster with the [[Harpe|magical sword]] he had used against Medusa, saving Andromeda.

The earliest straightforward account of Perseus using Medusa's head against Cetus, however, is from the later 2nd century AD [[Satire|satirist]] [[Lucian]] (''The Hall'', 22) < ref > Lucian describes a painting of  \" a story half Argive, half Ethiopian. Perseus slays the sea-monster, and sets Andromeda free; it will not be long ere he leads her away as his bride; an episode, this, in his Gorgon expedition. The artist has given us much in a small space: maiden modesty, girlish terror, are here portrayed in the countenance of Andromeda, who from her high rock gazes down upon the strife, and marks the devoted courage of her lover, the grim aspect of his bestial antagonist. As that bristling horror approaches, with awful gaping jaws, Perseus in his left hand displays the Gorgon's head, while his right grasps the drawn sword. All of the monster that falls beneath Medusa's eyes is stone already; and all of him that yet lives the [[scimitar]] hews to pieces. \" < /ref >   \n * The 12th century [[Byzantine]] writer [[John Tzetzes]], in his ''Scholiast'' (notes) on [[Lycophron]]'s ''Alexandra'' (836), says that Cetus swallows Perseus, who kills the monster by hacking his way out with his sword.  \n * [[Conon (mythographer)|Conon]] (''Narrations'', 40) places the story in Joppa (Iope or [[Jaffa]], on the  coast of modern [[Israel]]), and seeks to rationalize the myth by making Andromeda's uncles Phineus and Phoinix rivals for her hand in marriage; her father Cepheus contrives to have Phoinix abduct her in a ship named ''Cetos'' from a small island she visits to ''make sacrifices'' to Aphrodite, and Perseus, sailing nearby, intercedes and destroys ''Cetos'' and its crew, who are  \" petrified by shock \"  at his bravery. Conon thus explains away all the exotic and magical elements of the story. \n \n == Ethnicities of Andromeda == \n Andromeda was the daughter of the king and queen of Ethiopia ([[Aethiopia|Aithiopia/Aethiopia]]), which [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] located at the edge of the world of the lands south of [[Egypt]] ([[Nubia]]).

In the kingdom of [[Mero\u00eb]] (modern [[Sudan]]), Queen Persinna gives birth to her daughter, Chariclea who, despite having black parents, is born with white skin. The mother's explanation is that, during the moment of [[Fertilisation|conception]], she was gazing at a picture of a white-skinned Andromeda  \" brought down by Perseus naked from the rock, and so by mishap engendered presently a thing like to her. \" < ref > Heliodorus, ''Aethiopica'' book 4 < /ref >  After being long separated from her parents, living in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] and [[Greece in the Roman era|Greece]], Princess Chariclea returns home with her lover Theagnes and proves both her heritage and her mother's story as true by showing her parents a single black spot upon her elbow. Like the mythical Andromeda, Chariclea thus 'passes' as a member of the Greek/Roman world as well as of her African birthplace. \n \n This ambiguity is also reflected in a description by the 2nd century AD [[sophist]] [[Philostratus]] of a painting depicting Perseus and Andromeda. < ref > [[Imagines (work by Philostratus)|''Imagines'']] 1.29 < /ref >  He emphasizes the painting's Ethiopian setting, and notes that Andromeda  \" is charming in that she is fair of skin ''though in Ethiopia'', \"  in clear contrast to the other  \" charming Ethiopians with their strange coloring and their grim smiles \"  who have assembled to cheer Perseus in this picture. \n \n [[File:Museo Nazionale Napoli - Perseus and Andromeda.jpg|thumb|left|Perseus freeing Andromeda after killing Cetus, 1st century AD fresco from the ''Casa Dei Dioscuri'', [[Pompeii]]]] \n \n [[File:Gaziantep Zeugma Museum Andromeda mosaic 4170.jpg|thumb| Detail of Andromeda mosaic from 'House of Poseidon' in [[Zeugma (Commagene)|Zeugma]],Turkey, 2nd-3rd century AD]] \n \n Through the centuries, Ovid's descriptions of Andromeda and/or other authors' references to her African/Indian origins have influenced some Western artists, but not the majority. The alternative tradition of Andromeda's story taking place at Joppa (on the coast of modern [[Israel]]) suggested that she was of light complexion to some artists, while others simply followed the tendency of artists everywhere to make the main subjects of their works look like themselves and the people around them. [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[fresco]]es from [[Pompeii]] show light-skinned Andromedas, for instance, but a 2nd-3rd century AD Roman [[mosaic]] found at [[Zeugma (Commagene)|Zeugma]] in modern [[Turkey]] shows her with darker skin tones, which would be more common in the [[Middle East]] (see illustrations). A few Renaissance and Baroque artists, such as Piero di Cosimo, Titian, Giorgio Vasari, and Abraham van Diepenbeeck, painted Andromedas with darker or dusky-colored skin tones (see [[#Gallery|Gallery]]), but Ovid's tradition was not continued by their contemporaries or later artists. \n \n == Cultural references == \n {{In popular culture|section|date=March 2021}} \n \n ===Constellations=== \n [[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Gloria Frederici, Andromeda, and Triangula.jpg|thumb|The constellation Andromeda as depicted in [[Urania's Mirror]], a set of constellation cards by [[Sidney Hall]] published in London c. 1825]] \n \n Andromeda is represented in the [[Northern celestial hemisphere|Northern sky]] by the [[constellation]] [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], which contains the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]. \n \n Several constellations are associated with the myth.

In the film Cassiopeia boasts that her daughter is more beautiful than the single Nereid [[Thetis]], rather than the Nereids as a group. Andromeda and Perseus meet and fall in love after he saves her soul from the enslavement of Thetis'  \" son \"  Calibos (a made-up character introduced to provide Perseus with a [[Villain|dramatic foil]]) and ''before'' he slays Medusa, whereas in the myth they first meet when Perseus finds Andromeda chained to the rock as he is returning home from having ''already'' slain Medusa. In the film the monster is called a ''[[kraken]]'' (which was the name of a giant squid-like sea monster in [[Norse mythology]]) and looks very different from the whale-like [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetos]] of [[Greek mythology]]. Perseus defeats the sea monster by showing it Medusa's face to turn it into stone, even though the [[Classical mythology|Classical sources]] typically say he killed the monster with his [[Harpe|magical sword]]. In the film Perseus tames and rides the flying horse [[Pegasus]], which in [[Classical mythology]]  was done by the hero [[Bellerophon]]. Perseus' use of Pegasus, along with his turning the monster to stone, was added to Perseus' myth in [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]]. Also, Henry Louis Gates, Jr. criticizes this film (and its 2010 remake) for using white actresses to portray the Ethiopian princess Andromeda. < ref > Henry Louis Gates, Jr. ''Was Andromeda Black?'', Roots (17 Feb 2014) https://www.theroot.com/was-andromeda-black-1790874592 < /ref > \n * In the Japanese anime ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' (1986-    ), the character [[Andromeda Shun|Shun]] represents the [[Andromeda constellation]] using chains as his main weapons, reminiscent of Andromeda being chained before she was saved by Perseus. In order to attain the Andromeda Cloth, he was chained between two large pillars of rock and he had to overcome the chains before the tide came in and killed him, also reminiscent of this myth. \n * Andromeda appears in [[Disney]]'s ''[[Hercules: The Animated Series]]'' (1998-1999) as a new student of  \" Prometheus Academy \"  which Hercules and other characters from Greek mythology attend. \n * The main character in ''[[My Sister's Keeper (film)|My Sister's Keeper's]]'' (2010) is named Andromeda, linking her parents' plan for her to sacrifice organs to keep her sister alive to the mythical Andromeda who was sacrificed by her parents. \n * Andromeda is featured in the 2010 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', a remake of the 1981 version which strays so much further from the myth's ancient sources, and Greek mythology in general, that there is little reason to make comparisons. The 2012 sequel, ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]'', draws more from [[Norse mythology]]'s twilight of the gods ([[Ragnar\u00f6k]]), than Greek mythology. \n \n ===In art=== \n Andromeda, and her role in the popular myth of Perseus, has been the subject of numerous ancient and modern works of art, where she is represented as a bound and helpless, typically beautiful, young woman placed in terrible danger, who must be saved through the unswerving courage of a hero who loves her: (see [[#Gallery|Gallery]]) \n [[File:P.P._Rubens_-_Perseus_en_Andromeda_-_NK3577_-_Museum_Boijmans_Van_Beuningen.jpg|thumb|Perseus en Andromeda - NK3577 - Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] \n * Although ancient artists at first presented her fully clothed, nude images of Andromeda started appearing during [[Classical antiquity]], and by the [[Renaissance]] the chained nude figure of Andromeda, either alone or being rescued, had become the standard, as seen in works by [[Titian]], [[Joachim Wtewael]], [[Giuseppe Cesari|Cesari]], [[Bartolomeo Passerotti|Passerotti]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Nicolas Bertin|Bertin]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher|Boucher]], [[Charles Andr\u00e9 van Loo|van Loo]], [[Gustave Moreau|Moreau]], [[John Roddam Spencer Stanhope|Stanhope]], and [[Edward Burne-Jones|Burne-Jones]].  \n * Rather than dwelling on Andromeda's physical beauty, artists such as [[Rembrandt]], [[Domenico Fetti|Fetti]], [[Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau|Chass\u00e9riau]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Gustave Dor\u00e9|Dor\u00e9]], [[Frederic, Lord Leighton|Leighton]], and ([[Satire|satirically]]) [[F\u00e9lix Vallotton|Vallotton]], have focused on her terror and vulnerability as she awaits the monster. \n * Some artists such as [[Piero di Cosimo]], Jan Keynooghe, [[Jacob Matham]], and [[Pierre Mignard]], have shown Andromeda in relation to her parents and onlookers.  \n Andromeda was a popular subject for artists especially in the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] eras, followed by a resurgence of interest in her myth in the 19th century, but since then artists have shown much less interest in this subject. \n \n '''Other Art Traditions Inspired by the Andomeda Myth:''' \n [[File:Saint George and the Dragon by Paolo Uccello (London) 01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Paolo Uccello]], ''Saint George and the Dragon'', ca. 1456]] \n [[File:Tapestry, Story of Perseus and Andromeda, Netherlands, early 16th century.jpg|center|thumb|''Story of Perseus and Andromeda'', ([[tapestry]], Netherlands, early 1500s) showing Perseus as a medieval knight astride Pegasus]] \n [[File:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres - Roger Delivering Angelica.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], Roger Delivering Angelica (1819)]] \n * The legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]], in which a courageous [[knight]] rescues a princess from a monster (with clear parallels to the Andromeda myth), became a popular subject for art in the [[Late Middle Ages]], and artists drew from both traditions. One result is the idea of having Perseus riding the flying horse [[Pegasus]] when fighting the sea monster (as seen in paintings by [[Jacob Matham|Matham]], [[Bartolomeo Passerotti|Passerotti]], [[Giuseppe Cesari|Cesari]], [[Joachim Wtewael|Wtewael]], [[Rubens]], [[Pierre Mignard|Mignard]], [[Nicolas Bertin|Bertin]], and [[Frederic Leighton|Leighton]] below), despite [[Classical mythology|classical sources]] consistently stating that he flew using [[winged sandals]] and connecting Pegasus to the hero [[Bellerophon|Bellerophon's]] adventures. \n * [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s influential [[epic poem]] ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (1516-1532) features a [[pagan]] princess named [[Angelica (character)|Angelica]] who at one point is in exactly the same situation as Andromeda, chained naked to a rock on the sea as a sacrifice to a sea monster, and is saved at the last minute by the [[Saracen]] knight [[Ruggiero (character)|Ruggiero]]. Artists were drawn to this subject for the same reasons they appreciated the Andromeda myth, and images of Angelica and Ruggiero (or Roggiero/Roger) are often hard to distinguish from those of Andromeda and Perseus \n \n ==Gallery== \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 188 \" > \n File:Piero di Cosimo - Andromeda liberata da Perseo.jpg|[[Piero di Cosimo]], ''[[Perseus Freeing Andromeda]]'', ca. 1510 \n File:Perseo y Andr\u00f3meda, por Tiziano.jpg| [[Titian]], ''Perseus and Andromeda'', 1554-1556 \n File:Vasari, perseo e andromeda, studiolo.jpg|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''Perseus and Andromeda'', 1570 \n File:Bartolomeo Passerotti Perseo Galleria Sabauda 22072015.jpg|[[Bartolomeo Passerotti]], ''Perseus Freeing Andromeda,'' between 1572 and 1575 \n File:Veronese-pers\u00e9e-rennes.jpg|[[Paolo Veronese]], ''Perseus rescuing Andromeda'', between 1576 and 1578 \n File:Perseus and Andromeda LACMA M.88.91.422.jpg|[[Jacob Matham]], ''Andromeda'', 1597 \n File:D'arpino-Androm\u00e8de.jpg|[[Giuseppe Cesari]], ''Perseus and Andromeda'', 1602 \n File:Persus and Andromeda by Joachim Wtewael.jpg|[[Joachim Wtewael]], ''Perseus Releases Andromeda'', 1611 \n File:Domenico Fetti 011.jpg|[[Domenico Fetti]], ''Andromeda and Perseus'', ca. 1621-1622 \n File:Peter Paul Rubens - Perseus and Andromeda (Hermitage Museum).jpg|[[Peter Paul Rubens]], ''Perseus and Andromeda'', ca. 1622 \n File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 011.jpg|[[Rembrandt]], ''[[Andromeda Chained to the Rocks]]'', 1630 \n File:Mignard-Andromeda and Perseus.jpg|[[Pierre Mignard]], ''The Liberation of Andromeda'', 1679 \n File:Andromeda and the Sea Monster MET DP248138.jpg|[[Domenico Guidi]], ''Andromeda and the Sea Monster'', 1694 \n File:Beaux-Arts de Carcassonne - Pers\u00e9e d\u00e9livrant Androm\u00e8de - Nicolas Bertin Joconde04400000363.jpg|[[Nicolas Bertin]] (1667-1736), ''Perseus Freeing Andromeda'' \n File:Fran\u00e7ois Boucher - Andromeda (Androm\u00e8de) - 2016.7 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|[[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], ''Andromeda'', 1732 \n File:Charles Andr\u00e9 van Loo - Perseus and Andromeda - WGA13431.jpg|[[Charles Andr\u00e9 van Loo]], ''Perseus and Andromeda'', between 1735 and 1740 \n File:1840 Chasseriau Theodore - Andromeda Chained to the Rock by the Nereids.jpg|[[Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau]], ''Andromeda Chained to the Rock by the Nereids'', 1840  \n File:Julius Troschel Perseus und Andromeda 1840-50 Neue Pinakothek-1.jpg|Julius Troschel, ''Perseus and Andromeda'', 1840-1850 \n File:Delacroix Andromeda.jpg|[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], ''Perseus and Andromeda'', ca. 1853 \n File:Gustave Dor\u00e9 Andromeda.jpg|[[Gustave Dor\u00e9|Paul Gustave Dor\u00e9]], ''Andromeda'', 1869 \n File:Gustave Moreau - Perseus and Andromeda, 1870.jpg|[[Gustave Moreau]], ''Perseus and Andromeda'', 1870 \n File:1869 Edward Poynter - Andromeda.jpg|[[Edward Poynter]], ''Andromeda'', 1869 \n File:Edward BURNE-Jones - Perseus and Andromeda - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Edward Burne-Jones]], ''Perseus and Andromeda'', 1876 \n File:John Roddam Spencer Stanhope - Andromeda.jpg|[[John Roddam Spencer Stanhope]], ''Andromeda'', 1886 \n File:Frederic, Lord Leighton - Perseus and Andromeda - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Frederic, Lord Leighton]], ''[[Perseus and Andromeda (Leighton)|Perseus and Andromeda]]'', 1891 \n File:F\u00e9lix Vallotton Pers\u00e9e tuant le dragon 1910.JPG|[[F\u00e9lix Vallotton]], ''Perseus Killing the Dragon,'' 1910 \n < /gallery > \n \n ==See also== \n * [[Angelica (character)|Angelica]] \n * [[Atalanta]] \n * [[Dana\u00eb]] \n * [[Ethiopia (Greek mythology)]] \n * [[Hesione]] \n * [[Iphigenia]] \n \n ==Notes== \n {{Reflist}} \n \n ==Sources== \n '''For Full Text and Translations of Source Materials and Articles on Mythology:''' \n * Perseus Digital Library (Tufts University) https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/ \n * Theoi Greek Mythology https://www.theoi.com/ \n \n '''Primary Greek and Roman sources:''' \n * [[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Library (Bibliotheca)]]'' 2.4.3\u20135 (online English translation by James George Frazer (1921): https://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html) \n * [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 4.668\u20135.235 (online English translation by Brooks More (1922): https://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidMetamorphoses1.html) \n \n '''Comprehensive Studies of the Perseus myth:''' \n * Edwin Hartland, ''The Legend of Perseus: A Study of Tradition in Story, Custom and Belief'', 3 vols.
