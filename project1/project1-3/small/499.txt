< ref name =  \" ssdjlv \" > Exodus Rabbah 1:17 < /ref >  however, the text goes on to state that Miriam, his daughter, chided him for his lack of care for his wife's feelings, persuading him to recant and marry Jochebed again. < ref name =  \" ssdjlv \" / >  According to the [[Talmud]], Amram promulgated the laws of marriage and divorce amongst the Jews in Egypt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} the Talmud also argues that Amram had extreme longevity, which he used to ensure that doctrines were preserved through several generations. < ref > ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' < /ref > \n \n Despite the legend of his divorce and remarriage, Amram was also held to have been entirely sinless throughout his life, and was rewarded for this by his corpse remaining without any signs of decay. < ref > [[Baba Batra]] 17a < /ref >   The other three  ancient Israelites who died without sin, being [[Benjamin]], [[Jesse]] and [[Chileab]]. \n \n According to the [[Book of Jubilees]], Amram was among the Israelites who took the bones of Jacob's sons (excluding those of [[Joseph (Genesis)]]) to Canaan for burial in the [[cave of Machpelah]]. < ref name= \" Jubilees 46:11 \" > Jubilees 46:11 < /ref >  Most of the Israelites then returned to Egypt but some remained in Canaan, including Amram who only returned somewhere up to forty years later. \n \n One of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (4Q544, Manuscript B) is written from Amram's point of view, and hence has been dubbed the ''[[Visions of Amram]]''. The document is dated to the 2nd century BC and, in the form of a vision, briefly discusses dualism and the [[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]]: \n {{Quote|I saw Watchers in my vision, the dream-vision. Two men were fighting over me...holding a great contest over me. I asked them, 'Who are you, that you are thus empowered over me?' They answered, 'We have been empowered and rule over all mankind.' They said to me, 'Which of us do you choose to rule you?' I raised my eyes and looked. One of them was terrifying in his appearance, like a serpent, his cloak, many-colored yet very dark....And I looked again, and in his appearance, his visage like a [[Viperidae|viper]]....I replied to him, 'This Watcher, who is he?' He answered, 'This Watcher...his three names are [[Belial]] and Prince of Darkness and King of Evil.' I said (to the other Watcher), 'My lord, what dominion (have you?)' He answered, 'You saw (the viper), and he is empowered over all Darkness, while I (am empowered over all Light.)...My three names are [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Prince of Light (Bible)|Prince of Light]] and [[King of Righteousness]]. < ref > translation by Prof. Robert Eisenman < /ref > }} \n \n == See also == \n * [[Al Imran]],  \" The Family of Imran \" , 3rd chapter of the Quran  \n *[[Joachim]], father of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] \n \n == References == \n {{Reflist}} \n \n {{Qur'anic people}} \n {{Authority control}} \n \n [[Category:Ancient Egyptian Jews]] \n [[Category:Levites]] \n [[Category:Torah people]] \n [[Category:People of the Quran]] \n [[Category:Moses]] \n [[Category:Aaron]] \n [[Category:Tribe of Levi]]"
