A lustrous gray [[metalloid]], it is found in nature mainly as the [[sulfide mineral]] [[stibnite]] (Sb < sub > 2 < /sub > S < sub > 3 < /sub > ).

The earliest known description of the metal in the West was written in 1540 by [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]]. \n \n For some time, China has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds, with most production coming from the [[Xikuangshan Mine]] in [[Hunan]]. The industrial methods for refining antimony are roasting and [[carbothermic reaction|reduction with carbon]] or direct reduction of [[stibnite]] with iron. \n \n The largest applications for metallic antimony are an alloy with lead and [[tin]] and the lead antimony plates in [[lead\u2013acid battery|lead\u2013acid batteries]]. Alloys of lead and tin with antimony have improved properties for [[solder]]s, [[bullet]]s, and [[plain bearing]]s. Antimony compounds are prominent additives for chlorine and bromine-containing [[fire retardant]]s found in many commercial and domestic products. An emerging application is the use of antimony in [[microelectronics]]. \n \n ==Characteristics== \n \n ===Properties=== \n [[File:Antimon.PNG|thumb|left|alt=A clear vial containing small chunks of a slightly lustrous black solid, labeled  \" Sb \" .|A vial containing the black [[allotrope]] of antimony]] \n [[File:Antimony massive.jpg|left|thumb|alt=An irregular piece of silvery stone with spots of variation in luster and shade.|Native antimony with [[redox|oxidation]] products]] \n [[File:SbAs lattice.png|thumb|left|Crystal structure common to Sb, [[stibarsen|AsSb]] and gray As]] \n Antimony is a member of [[Group (periodic table)|group 15]] of the periodic table, one of the elements called [[pnictogen]]s, and has an [[electronegativity]] of 2.05.

Elemental antimony is a [[brittle]], silver-white shiny metalloid. When slowly cooled, molten antimony crystallizes in a [[trigonal]] cell, [[isomorphic]] with the gray allotrope of [[arsenic]]. A rare [[explosive form of antimony]] can be formed from the electrolysis of [[antimony trichloride]]. When scratched with a sharp implement, an [[exothermic]] reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as metallic antimony forms; when rubbed with a pestle in a mortar, a strong detonation occurs. Black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of antimony vapor. It has the same crystal structure as [[red phosphorus]] and black arsenic; it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously. At 100 & nbsp;\u00b0C, it gradually transforms into the stable form. The yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable. It has only been generated by oxidation of [[stibine]] (SbH < sub > 3 < /sub > ) at \u221290 & nbsp;\u00b0C. Above this temperature and in ambient light, this [[metastability|metastable]] allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope. < ref name=kirk/ > < ref name= \" cww \" / > < ref > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVhpurkfeN4C & pg=PA50|pages=50\u201351|title=Chemistry of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth|isbn=978-0-7514-0389-3|author=Norman, Nicholas C|date=1998}} < /ref > \n \n Elemental antimony adopts a layered structure ([[space group]] R{{overline|3}}m No. 166) in which layers consist of fused, ruffled, six-membered rings.

As China is revising and increasing environmental control standards, antimony production is becoming increasingly restricted.{{fact|date=May 2021}} Additionally Chinese export quotas for antimony have been decreasing in the past years.

As seen in Figure xxx antimony maintains high supply risk relative to its economic importance. 92% of the antimony is imported from China, which is a significantly high concentration of production. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52014DC0297|title=Review of the list of critical raw materials for the EU and the implementation of the Raw Materials Initiative}} < /ref > \n \n ====U.S.==== \n Much analysis has been conducted in the U.S. toward defining which metals should be called strategic or critical to the nation's security.

Elemental antimony metal does not affect human and environmental health. Inhalation of antimony trioxide (and similar poorly soluble Sb(III) dust particles such as antimony dust) is considered harmful and suspected of causing cancer. However, these effects are only observed with female rats and after long-term exposure to high dust concentrations. The effects are hypothesized to be attributed to inhalation of poorly soluble Sb particles leading to impaired lung clearance, lung overload, inflammation and ultimately tumour formation, not to exposure to antimony ions (OECD, 2008). Antimony chlorides are corrosive to skin. The effects of antimony are not comparable to those of arsenic; this might be caused by the significant differences of uptake, metabolism, and excretion between arsenic and antimony. \n \n For oral absorption, ICRP (1994) has recommended values of 10% for tartar emetic and 1% for all other antimony compounds. Dermal absorption for metals is estimated to be at most 1% (HERAG, 2007). Inhalation absorption of antimony trioxide and other poorly soluble Sb(III) substances (such as antimony dust) is estimated at 6.8% (OECD, 2008), whereas a value  < 1% is derived for Sb(V) substances. Antimony(V) is not quantitatively reduced to antimony(III) in the cell, and both species exist simultaneously. \n \n Antimony is mainly excreted from the human body via urine. Antimony and its compounds do not cause acute human health effects, with the exception of [[antimony potassium tartrate]] ( \" tartar emetic \" ), a [[prodrug]] that is intentionally used to treat [[leishmaniasis]] patients. \n \n Prolonged skin contact with antimony dust may cause dermatitis. However, it was agreed at the European Union level that the skin rashes observed are not substance-specific, but most probably due to a physical blocking of sweat ducts (ECHA/PR/09/09, Helsinki, 6 July 2009). Antimony dust may also be explosive when dispersed in the air; when in a bulk solid it is not combustible. < ref name= \" :0 \" > {{PGCH|0036}} < /ref > \n \n Antimony is incompatible with strong acids, halogenated acids, and oxidizers; when exposed to newly formed hydrogen it may form [[stibine]] (SbH < sub > 3 < /sub > ). < ref name= \" :0 \" / > \n \n The 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) is set at 0.5 & nbsp;mg/m < sup > 3 < /sup >  by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] and by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) as a legal [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) in the workplace.
