The range is {{convert|7000.|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|200.|to|700.|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide (widest between [[18th parallel south|18\u00b0S]] - [[20th parallel south|20\u00b0S]] [[latitude]]), and has an average height of about {{convert|4000.|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], and [[Argentina]]. \n \n Along their length, the Andes are split into several ranges, separated by intermediate [[depression (geology)|depressions]]. The Andes are the location of several high [[plateau]]s\u2014some of which host major cities such as [[Quito]], [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Cali]], [[Arequipa]], [[Medell\u00edn]], [[Bucaramanga]], [[Sucre]], [[M\u00e9rida, M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida]], [[El Alto]] and [[La Paz]]. The [[Altiplano|Altiplano plateau]] is the world's second-highest after the [[Tibetan plateau]]. These ranges are in turn grouped into three major divisions based on climate: the [[Tropical Andes]], the [[Dry Andes]], and the [[Wet Andes]]. \n \n The Andes Mountains are the highest mountain range outside Asia. The highest mountain outside Asia, Argentina's Mount [[Aconcagua]], rises to an elevation of about {{convert|6961|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The [[Summit (topography)|peak]] of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] in the Ecuadorian Andes is farther from the Earth's center than any other location on the Earth's surface, due to the [[equatorial bulge]] resulting from the [[Earth's rotation]]. The world's highest [[volcano]]es are in the Andes, including [[Ojos del Salado]] on the Chile-Argentina border, which rises to {{convert|6893|m|ft|abbr=on}}. \n \n The Andes are also part of the [[American Cordillera]], a chain of mountain ranges ([[cordillera]]) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western  \" backbone \"  of North America, Central America, South America and Antarctica. \n [[File:Cono de Arita, Salta.

The Andes are the result of [[tectonic plate]] processes, caused by the [[subduction]] of [[oceanic crust]] beneath the [[South American Plate]]. It is the result of a convergent plate boundary between the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate. The main cause of the rise of the Andes is the compression of the western rim of the [[South American Plate]] due to the subduction of the [[Nazca Plate]] and the [[Antarctic Plate]]. To the east, the Andes range is bounded by several [[sedimentary basin]]s, such as [[Orinoco]], [[Amazon Basin]], [[Madre de Dios River|Madre de Dios]] and [[Gran Chaco]], that separate the Andes from the ancient [[craton]]s in eastern South America. In the south, the Andes share a long boundary with the former [[Patagonia#Geology|Patagonia Terrane]]. To the west, the Andes end at the [[Pacific Ocean]], although the [[Peru-Chile trench]] can be considered their ultimate western limit. From a geographical approach, the Andes are considered to have their western boundaries marked by the appearance of coastal lowlands and a less rugged topography. The Andes Mountains also contain large quantities of iron ore located in many mountains within the range. \n \n The Andean orogen has a series of bends or [[orocline]]s. The Bolivian Orocline is a seaward concave bending in the coast of South America and the Andes Mountains at about 18\u00b0 S. < ref name=Isacks1988/ > < ref name=Kley1999 > {{Citation \n | last  = Kley \n | first = J. \n | title = Geologic and geometric constraints on a kinematic model of the Bolivian orocline \n | journal = [[Journal of South American Earth Sciences]] \n | volume  = 12 \n | issue   = 2 \n | year    = 1999 \n | pages   = 221\u2013235 \n | doi=10.1016/s0895-9811(99)00015-2 \n | bibcode= 1999JSAES..12..221K \n }} < /ref >  At this point, the orientation of the Andes turns from Northwest in [[Peru]] to South in [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. < ref name=Kley1999/ >  The Andean segment north and south of the Orocline have been rotated 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 counter clockwise and clockwise respectively. < ref name=Kley1999/ > < ref name=Beck1987 > {{Citation \n | last  = Beck \n | first = Myrl E. \n | title = Tectonic rotations on the leading edge of South America: The Bolivian orocline revisited \n | journal = [[Geology (journal)|Geology]] \n | volume  = 15 \n | issue   = 9 \n | year    = 1987 \n | pages   = 806\u2013808 \n | doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1987)15 < 806:trotle > 2.0.co;2 \n | bibcode= 1987Geo....15..806B \n }} < /ref >  The Bolivian Orocline area overlaps with the area of maximum width of the [[Altiplano|Altiplano Plateau]] and according to Isacks (1988) the Orocline is related to [[crustal shortening]]. < ref name=Isacks1988 > {{Citation \n | last  = Isacks \n | first = Bryan L. \n | title = Uplift of the Central Andean Plateau and Bending of the Bolivian Orocline \n | journal = [[Journal of Geophysical Research]] \n | volume  = 93 \n | issue   = B4 \n | year    = 1988 \n | pages   = 3211\u20133231 \n | url     = http://geomorphology.sese.asu.edu/Papers/Isacks_Uplift_Andean_Plateau_1988.pdf \n | doi=10.1029/jb093ib04p03211 \n | bibcode= 1988JGR....93.3211I \n }} < /ref >  The specific point at 18\u00b0 S where the coastline bends is known as the  \" Arica Elbow \" . < ref name=PrezziVilas > {{cite journal |last1=Prezzi |first1=Claudia B. |last2=Vilas |first2=Juan F.|date=1998 |title=New evidence of clockwise vertical axis rotations south of the Arica elbow (Argentine Puna)  |journal=[[Tectonophysics (journal)|Tectonophysics]] |volume=292 |issue= 1|pages=85\u2013100 |doi= 10.1016/s0040-1951(98)00058-4|bibcode=1998Tectp.292...85P}} < /ref >  Further south lies the Maipo Orocline a more subtle Orocline between 30\u00b0 S and 38\u00b0S with a seaward-concave break in trend at 33\u00b0 S. < ref name=Arriagada2013 > {{Citation \n | last1  = Arriagada \n | first1 = C\u00e9sar \n | last2  = Ferrando \n | first2 = Rodolfo \n | last3  = C\u00f3rdova \n | first3 = Loreto \n | last4  = Morata \n | first4 = Diego \n | last5  = Roperch \n | first5 = Pierrick \n | title = The Maipo Orocline: A first scale structural feature in the Miocene to Recent geodynamic evolution in the central Chilean Andes \n | journal = [[Andean Geology]] \n | volume  = 40 \n | issue   = 3 \n | year    = 2013 \n | pages   = 419\u2013437 \n | url     = http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/andgeol/v40n3/art02.pdf \n }} < /ref >  Near the southern tip of the Andes lies the Patagonian Orocline. < ref name=Charrieretal2006 > {{cite book |last1=Charrier |first1=Reynaldo|last2=Pinto |first2=Luisa |last3=Rodr\u00edguez |first3=Mar\u00eda P\u00eda|author-link=Reynaldo Charrier |editor-last=Moreno |editor-first=Teresa |editor-last2=Gibbons |editor-first2=Wes |title=Geology of Chile |publisher=Geological Society of London |date=2006 |pages=5\u201319 |chapter=3.

The development continued through the [[Jurassic]] Period. It was during the [[Cretaceous]] Period that the Andes began to take their present form, by the [[Tectonic uplift|uplifting]], [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[Fold (geology)|folding]] of [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] rocks of the ancient cratons to the east. The rise of the Andes has not been constant, as different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress, uplift, and [[erosion]]. \n \n Tectonic forces above the [[subduction zone]] along the entire west coast of South America where the [[Nazca Plate]] and a part of the [[Antarctic Plate]] are sliding beneath the [[South American Plate]] continue to produce an ongoing [[Orogeny|orogenic event]] resulting in minor to major [[earthquake]]s and [[volcanic eruption]]s to this day. In the extreme south, a major [[transform fault]] separates [[Tierra del Fuego]] from the small [[Scotia Plate]]. Across the {{convert|1000|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} wide [[Drake Passage]] lie the mountains of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] south of the Scotia Plate which appear to be a continuation of the Andes chain. \n \n The regions immediately east of the Andes experience a series of changes resulting from the Andean orogeny. Parts of the [[Suns\u00e1s orogeny|Suns\u00e1s Orogen]] in [[Amazonian craton]] disappeared from the surface of earth being [[thrust fault|overridden]] by the Andes. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Santos |first1=J.O.S. |last2=Rizzotto |first2=G.J. |last4=McNaughton |first4=N.J.|last3=Potter |first3=P.E.|last5=Matos |first5=R.S.|last6=Hartmann |first6=L.A.|last7=Chemale Jr. |first7=F.|last8=Quadros |first8=M.E.S.|date=2008 |title=Age and autochthonous evolution of the Suns\u00e1s Orogen in West Amazon Craton based on mapping and U\u2013Pb geochronology |journal=[[Precambrian Research]] |volume=165 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=120\u2013152 |doi= 10.1016/j.precamres.2008.06.009|bibcode=2008PreR..165..120S}} < /ref > \n The [[Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba]], where the effects of the ancient [[Pampean orogeny]] can be observed, owe their modern uplift and relief to the [[Andean orogeny]] in the [[Tertiary]]. < ref name=Rapelaetal1998 > {{cite book |last1=Rapela |first1=C.W. |last2=Pankhurst |first2=R.J|last3=Casquet |first3=C.|last4=Baldo |first4=E.|last5=Saavedra |first5=J.|last6=Galindo |first6=C.|last7=Fanning |first7=C.M. |author-link2=Robert John Pankhurst|date=1998 |editor-last2=Rapela |editor-first2=C.W. |editor-last1=Pankhurst |editor-first1=R.J|chapter=The Pampean Orogeny of the southern proto-Andes: Cambrian continental collision in the Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba  |chapter-url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/142/1/181.full.pdf |title=The Proto-Andean Margin of Gondwana |journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications |volume=142 |issue=1 |pages=181\u2013217 |doi= 10.1144/GSL.SP.1998.142.01.10|s2cid=128814617 |access-date=7 December 2015}} < /ref >  Further south in southern [[Patagonia]] the onset of the Andean orogeny caused the [[Magallanes Basin]] to evolve from being an [[extensional tectonics|extensional]] [[back-arc basin]] in the [[Mesozoic]] to being a compressional [[Andean Foreland Basin|foreland basin]] in the [[Cenozoic]]. < ref > {{cite journal |last=Wilson |first=T.J. |date=1991 |title=Transition from back-arc to foreland basin development in the southernmost Andes: Stratigraphic record from the Ultima Esperanza District, Chile |journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin |volume=103 |issue=1 |pages=98\u2013111 |doi= 10.1130/0016-7606(1991)103 < 0098:tfbatf > 2.3.co;2|bibcode=1991GSAB..103...98W}} < /ref > \n \n ===Volcanism=== \n {{Main|Andean Volcanic Belt}} \n [[File:Browncanyonquilotoa.jpg|thumb|[[Rift valley]] near [[Quilotoa]], [[Ecuador]]]] \n [[File:Central Andes Mountains, Salar de Arizaro, Argentina.jpg|thumb|upright|This photo from the [[ISS]] shows the high plains of the Andes Mountains in the foreground, with a line of young volcanoes facing the much lower Atacama Desert]] \n \n The Andes range has many active volcanoes distributed in four volcanic zones separated by areas of inactivity.

Despite being a type location for [[calc-alkalic]] and subduction volcanism, the Andean Volcanic Belt has a large range of volcano-tectonic settings, such as rift systems and extensional zones, transpressional faults, subduction of [[mid-ocean ridge]]s and [[seamount]] chains apart from a large range of crustal thicknesses and [[magma]] ascent paths, and different amount of crustal assimilations. \n \n ===Ore deposits and evaporates=== \n The Andes Mountains host large [[ore]] and [[salt]] deposits and some of their eastern [[fold and thrust belt]] acts as traps for commercially exploitable amounts of [[hydrocarbon]]s. In the forelands of the [[Atacama Desert]] some of the largest [[porphyry copper]] mineralizations occur making Chile and Peru the first- and second-largest exporters of [[copper]] in the world. Porphyry copper in the western slopes of the Andes has been generated by [[hydrothermal fluid]]s (mostly water) during the cooling of [[pluton (geology)|plutons]] or volcanic systems. The porphyry mineralization further benefited from the dry climate that let them largely out of the disturbing actions of [[meteoric water]]. The dry climate in the central western Andes has also led to the creation of extensive [[Chile saltpeter|saltpeter deposits]] which were extensively mined until the invention of synthetic nitrates. Yet another result of the dry climate are the [[Dry lake|salars]] of [[Salar de Atacama|Atacama]] and [[Salar de Uyuni|Uyuni]], the first one being the largest source of [[lithium]] today and the second the world's largest reserve of the element. Early Mesozoic and [[Neogene]] plutonism in Bolivia's Cordillera Central created the Bolivian [[tin]] belt as well as the famous, now depleted, deposits of [[Cerro Rico|Cerro Rico de Potos\u00ed]]. \n \n ==Climate and hydrology== \n {{See also|Tropical Andes|Dry Andes|Wet Andes}} \n [[File:Andes1a.JPG|thumb|Central Andes]] \n [[File:Andes bolivianos.jpg|thumb|Bolivian Andes]] \n \n The climate in the Andes varies greatly depending on latitude, altitude, and proximity to the sea. Temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity decrease in higher elevations. The southern section is rainy and cool, the central section is dry. The northern Andes are typically rainy and warm, with an average temperature of {{convert|18|C|F|0}} in Colombia. The climate is known to change drastically in rather short distances. [[Rainforest]]s exist just kilometres away from the snow-covered peak [[Cotopaxi]]. The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas. The [[snow line]] depends on the location. It is at between {{convert|4500.|and|4800.|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the tropical Ecuadorian, Colombian, Venezuelan, and northern Peruvian Andes, rising to {{convert|4800.|-|5200.|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about [[30th parallel south|30\u00b0S]] before descending to {{convert|4500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} on Aconcagua at [[32nd parallel south|32\u00b0S]], {{convert|2000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} at [[40th parallel south|40\u00b0S]], {{convert|500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} at [[50th parallel south|50\u00b0S]], and only {{convert|300|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} in [[Tierra del Fuego]] at [[55th parallel south|55\u00b0S]]; from 50\u00b0S, several of the larger glaciers descend to sea level. < ref > \n {{cite web \n  | title =Climate of the Andes \n  | url =http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/andes_climate_page.htm| access-date =2007-12-09| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071214073114/http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/andes_climate_page.htm| archive-date =14 December 2007| url-status =dead| df =dmy-all}} \n < /ref > \n \n The Andes of Chile and Argentina can be divided into two climatic and glaciological zones: the [[Dry Andes]] and the [[Wet Andes]].

A long series of cultural development culminated in the expansion of the [[Inca civilization]] and [[Inca Empire]] in the central Andes during the 15th century. The Incas formed this civilization through [[imperialism|imperialistic]] [[militarism]] as well as careful and meticulous governmental management. < ref > D'Altroy, Terence N. The Incas.

Some of these constructions are still in existence today. \n \n Devastated by European diseases to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] and [[Inca Civil War|civil wars]], the Incas were defeated in 1532 by an alliance composed of tens of thousands of allies from nations they had subjugated (e.g. [[Huanca people|Huancas]], [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], [[Ca\u00f1ari]]s) and a small army of 180 Spaniards led by [[Francisco Pizarro]]. One of the few Inca sites the Spanish never found in their conquest was [[Machu Picchu]], which lay hidden on a peak on the eastern edge of the Andes where they descend to the Amazon. The main surviving languages of the Andean peoples are those of the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language]] families.

For example, the main crossover of the Andes between Argentina and Chile is still accomplished through the [[Paso Internacional Los Libertadores]]. Only recently the ends of some highways that came rather close to one another from the east and the west have been connected. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1159492-jujuy-apuesta-a-captar-las-cargas-de-brasil-en-transito-hacia-chile|title=''Jujuy apuesta a captar las cargas de Brasil en tr\u00e1nsito hacia Chile'' by Emiliano Galli  |publisher=La Naci\u00f3n newspaper|access-date=2011-07-22|date=2009-08-07  }} < /ref >  Much of the transportation of passengers is done via aircraft. \n \n However, there is one railroad that connects Chile with Peru via the Andes, and there are others that make the same connection via southern Bolivia. See railroad maps of that region. \n \n There are multiple highways in Bolivia that cross the Andes. Some of these were built during a [[Chaco War|period of war]] between Bolivia and [[Paraguay]], in order to transport Bolivian troops and their supplies to the war front in the lowlands of southeastern Bolivia and western Paraguay. \n \n For decades, Chile claimed ownership of land on the eastern side of the Andes. However, these claims were given up in about 1870 during the [[War of the Pacific]] between Chile, the allied Bolivia and Peru, in a diplomatic deal to keep Peru out of the war. The [[Chilean Army]] and [[Chilean Navy]] defeated the combined forces of Bolivia and Peru, and Chile took over Bolivia's only province on the Pacific Coast, some land from Peru that was returned to Peru decades later. Bolivia has been a completely [[landlocked]] country ever since. It mostly uses [[seaport]]s in eastern Argentina and [[Uruguay]] for international trade because its diplomatic relations with Chile have been suspended since 1978. \n \n Because of the tortuous terrain in places, villages and towns in the mountains\u2014to which travel via [[motorized vehicle]]s is of little use\u2014are still located in the high Andes of Chile, Bolivia, Peru, and [[Ecuador]]. Locally, the relatives of the [[camel]], the [[llama]], and the [[alpaca]] continue to carry out important uses as pack animals, but this use has generally diminished in modern times. [[Donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, and horses are also useful. \n \n ===Agriculture=== \n [[File:Peruvianterracefarmers.jpg|thumb|Peruvian farmers sowing maize and beans]] \n {{See also|Andean Agriculture|Incan agriculture|Vertical archipelago}} \n \n The ancient peoples of the Andes such as the Incas have practiced [[irrigation]] techniques for over 6,000 years. Because of the mountain slopes, [[And\u00e9n|terracing]] has been a common practice. Terracing, however, was only extensively employed after Incan imperial expansions to fuel their expanding realm. The [[potato]] holds a very important role as an internally consumed staple crop. [[Maize]] was also an important crop for these people, and was used for the production of [[chicha]], important to Andean native people. Currently, [[tobacco]], [[cotton]] and [[coffee]] are the main export crops. [[Coca]], despite eradication programmes in some countries, remains an important crop for legal local use in a mildly stimulating [[herbal tea]], and, both controversially and illegally, for the production of [[cocaine]]. \n \n ===Irrigation=== \n [[File:Women irrigators in the Andes.jpg|thumb|left|Irrigating land in the Peruvian Andes]] \n \n In unirrigated land, [[pasture]] is the most common type of land use. In the rainy season (summer), part of the rangeland is used for cropping (mainly potatoes, barley, broad beans and wheat). \n \n Irrigation is helpful in advancing the sowing data of the summer crops which guarantees an early yield in the period of food shortage. Also, by early sowing, maize can be cultivated higher up in the mountains (up to {{cvt|3800|m|||}}). In addition, it makes cropping in the dry season (winter) possible and allows the cultivation of frost-resistant vegetable crops like [[onion]] and [[carrot]]. < ref > W. van Immerzeel, 1989.

Although Andean Amerindian peoples crafted ceremonial jewelry of gold and other metals, the [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralizations]] of the Andes were first mined on a large scale after the Spanish arrival. [[Potos\u00ed]] in present-day [[Bolivia]] and [[Cerro de Pasco]] in Peru was one of the principal mines of the Spanish Empire in the New World.

[[Peru]] also contains the 4th largest goldmine in the world: the [[Yanacocha]]. The Bolivian Andes produce principally [[tin]] although historically silver mining had a huge impact on the [[Price revolution|economy]] of 17th century Europe. \n \n There is a long history of mining in the Andes, from the Spanish [[silver]] [[Mining|mines]] in [[Potos\u00ed]] in the 16th century to the vast current [[porphyry copper deposit]]s of [[Chuquicamata]] and [[Escondida]] in Chile and [[Toquepala mine|Toquepala]] in Peru.
