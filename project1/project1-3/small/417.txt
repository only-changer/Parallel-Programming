  "Alypius of Antioch",
  "'''Alypius of Antioch''' was a [[geographer]] and a [[vicarius]] of [[Roman Britain]], probably in the late 350s AD. He replaced [[Flavius Martinus]] after that vicarius' suicide. His rule is recorded is [[Ammianus]] XXIII 1, 3. \n \n ==Life== \n He came from [[Antioch]] and served under [[Constantius II]] and was probably appointed to ensure that nobody with western associations was serving in Britain during a time of mistrust, rebellion and suppression symbolised by the brutal acts of the imperial notary [[Paulus Catena]]. He may have had to deal with the insurrection of the usurper named [[Carausius II]]. \n \n Alypius was afterwards commissioned to rebuild the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] as part of [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]]'s systematic attempt to reverse the [[Christianization]] of the [[Roman Empire]] by restoring [[Paganism|pagan]] and, in this case, [[Judaism|Jewish]] practices. < ref > [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''[[Ammianus Marcellinus#Work|Res Gestae]]'', XXIII.1.2 < /ref >  Among the letters of Julian are two (29 and 30) addressed to Alypius; one inviting him to [[Rome]], the other thanking him for a geographical treatise, which no longer exists. < ref > {{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Alypius (geographer)|display=Alypius|volume=1|page=776}} < /ref > \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist}} \n \n ==Sources== \n *Todd, M., ''Roman Britain'', Fontana, London 1985 \n *Salway, P., ''Roman Britain'', Oxford, 1986 \n \n {{Authority control}} \n [[Category:Jews and Judaism in the Roman Empire]] \n [[Category:Ancient Romans in Britain]] \n [[Category:People from Antioch]] \n [[Category:Roman-era geographers]] \n [[Category:Roman governors of Britain]] \n [[Category:4th-century Romans]] \n [[Category:Late-Roman-era pagans]] \n [[Category:4th-century geographers]] \n \n \n {{AncientRome-bio-stub}} \n {{Geographer-stub}}"
