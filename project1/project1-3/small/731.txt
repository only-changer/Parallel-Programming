  "{{short description|Compound containing rings with delocalized pi electrons}} \n {{Redirect|Arene}} \n \n '''Aromatic compounds''' are those [[chemical compound]]s (most commonly [[organic compound|organic]]) that contain one or more [[ring (chemistry)|ring]]s with [[pi electron]]s delocalized all the way around them. In contrast to compounds that exhibit [[aromaticity]], [[aliphatic compound]]s lack this delocalization. The term  \" aromatic \"  was assigned before the physical mechanism determining [[aromaticity]] was discovered, and referred simply to the fact that many such compounds have a sweet or pleasant odour; however, not all aromatic compounds have a sweet odour, and not all compounds with a sweet odour are aromatic. '''Aromatic hydrocarbons''', or '''arenes''', are aromatic organic compounds containing solely carbon and hydrogen atoms. The configuration of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is called a  \" benzene ring \" , after the simple aromatic compound [[benzene]], or a [[phenyl]] group when part of a larger compound. \n \n Not all aromatic compounds are benzene-based; aromaticity can also manifest in '''heteroarenes''', which follow [[H\u00fcckel's rule]] (for monocyclic rings: when the number of its \u03c0 electrons equals 4''n'' & nbsp;+ & nbsp;2, where ''n'' & nbsp;= & nbsp;0, 1, 2, 3, ...). In these compounds, at least one carbon atom is replaced by one of the [[heteroatom]]s [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], or [[sulfur]]. Examples of non-benzene compounds with aromatic properties are [[furan]], a heterocyclic compound with a five-membered ring that includes a single oxygen atom, and [[pyridine]], a heterocyclic compound with a six-membered ring containing one nitrogen atom. < ref > [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-aromatic.html HighBeam Encyclopedia: aromatic compound]. < /ref > \n \n == Benzene ring model == \n [[File:Benzene circle.svg|100px|right|thumb| [[Benzene]] ]] \n {{main|Aromaticity}} \n [[Benzene]],  < chem > C6H6 < /chem > , is the least complex aromatic hydrocarbon, and it was the first one named as such. The nature of its bonding was first recognized by [[August Kekul\u00e9]] in the 19th century. Each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share. One goes to the hydrogen atom, and one to each of the two neighbouring carbons. This leaves one electron to share with one of the two neighbouring carbon atoms, thus creating a double bond with one carbon and leaving a single bond with the other, which is why some representations of the benzene molecule portray it as a hexagon with alternating single and double bonds. \n \n Other depictions of the structure portray the hexagon with a circle inside it, to indicate that the six electrons are floating around in delocalized molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself. This represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon\u2013carbon bonds all of [[bond order]] 1.5; the equivalency is explained by [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance form]]s. The electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring, with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat. \n \n General properties of aromatic hydrocarbons: \n \n # They display [[aromaticity]] \n # The carbon\u2013hydrogen ratio is high \n # They burn with a strong sooty yellow flame because of the high carbon\u2013hydrogen ratio \n # They undergo [[electrophilic substitution reaction]]s and [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]]s \n \n The circle symbol for aromaticity was introduced by [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Sir Robert Robinson]] and his student James Armit in 1925 < ref > {{cite journal|first1=James Wilkins |last1=Armit |first2=Robert |last2=Robinson|author2-link=Robert Robinson (organic chemist) |date=1925 |title=Polynuclear heterocyclic aromatic types. Part II. Some anhydronium bases |journal=[[J. Chem. Soc. Trans.]] |volume=127 |pages=1604\u20131618}} < /ref >  and popularized starting in 1959 by the Morrison  &  Boyd textbook on organic chemistry. The proper use of the symbol is debated: some publications use it to ''any'' cyclic \u03c0 system, while others use it only for those \u03c0 systems that obey [[H\u00fcckel's rule]]. Jensen < ref > {{cite journal|first=William B. |last=Jensen |date=April 2009 |url=http://www.che.uc.edu/jensen/W.%20B.%20Jensen/Reprints/157.%20Aromaticity%20Circle.pdf |title=The circle symbol for aromaticity |journal=[[J.

In this way the circle symbol for a six-center six-electron bond can be compared to the Y symbol for a [[three-center two-electron bond]]. \n \n ==Arene synthesis== \n A reaction that forms an arene compound from an unsaturated or partially unsaturated cyclic precursor is simply called [[aromatization]]. Many laboratory methods exist for the [[organic synthesis]] of arenes from non-arene precursors. Many methods rely on [[cycloaddition]] reactions. [[Alkyne trimerization]] describes the [2+2+2] cyclization of three alkynes, in the [[D\u00f6tz reaction]] an alkyne, carbon monoxide and a chromium carbene complex are the reactants. [[Diels\u2013Alder reaction]]s of [[alkyne]]s with [[pyrone]] or [[cyclopentadienone]] with expulsion of [[carbon dioxide]] or carbon monoxide also form arene compounds. In [[Bergman cyclization]] the reactants are an [[enyne]] plus a hydrogen donor. \n \n Another set of methods is the aromatization of [[cyclohexane]]s and other aliphatic rings: reagents are catalysts used in [[hydrogenation]] such as platinum, palladium and nickel (reverse hydrogenation), [[quinone]]s and the elements [[sulfur]] and [[selenium]]. < ref > {{March3rd}} < /ref > \n \n ==Reactions== \n Aromatic ring systems participate in many organic reactions. \n \n ===Aromatic substitution=== \n In aromatic [[substitution reaction|substitution]] one [[substituent]] on the arene ring, usually hydrogen, is replaced by another substituent. The two main types are [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]] when the active reagent is an electrophile and [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]] when the reagent is a nucleophile. In [[radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution]] the active reagent is a radical. An example of electrophilic aromatic substitution is the nitration of [[salicylic acid]]: < ref > {{Cite journal \n | doi = 10.1016/0040-4039(95)00281-G \n | title = A mild oxidation of aromatic amines \n | year = 1995 \n | last2 = Seneviratne | first2 = V. \n | last1 = Webb | first1 = K. \n | journal = Tetrahedron Letters \n | volume = 36 \n | issue = 14 \n | pages = 2377\u20132378  \n }} < /ref > \n :[[File:Synthesis 5-Nitrosalicylic acid.svg|400px|Nitration of salicylic acid]] \n \n ===Coupling reactions=== \n In [[coupling reaction]]s a metal catalyses a coupling between two formal radical fragments. Common coupling reactions with arenes result in the formation of new [[carbon\u2013carbon bond]]s e.g., alkylarenes, vinyl arenes, biraryls, new [[carbon\u2013nitrogen bond]]s (anilines) or new [[carbon\u2013oxygen bond]]s (aryloxy compounds). An example is the direct arylation of [[perfluorobenzenes]]  < ref > {{Cite journal \n | doi = 10.1021/ja062509l \n | pmid = 16819868 \n | year = 2006 \n | last1 = Lafrance | first1 = M. \n | last2 = Rowley | first2 = C. \n | last3 = Woo | first3 = T. \n | last4 = Fagnou | first4 = K. \n | title = Catalytic intermolecular direct arylation of perfluorobenzenes. \n | volume = 128 \n | issue = 27 \n | pages = 8754\u20138756 \n | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society  \n | citeseerx = 10.1.1.631.607}} < /ref > \n :[[File:Fagnou fluoroarene coupling2.svg|600px|Coupling reaction]] \n \n ===Hydrogenation=== \n [[Hydrogenation]] of arenes create saturated rings.

Unusual thermal Diels\u2013Alder reactivity of arenes can be found in the [[Wagner-Jauregg reaction]]. Other photochemical cycloaddition reactions with alkenes occur through [[excimer]]s. \n \n ===Dearomatization=== \n In [[dearomatization reaction]]s the aromaticity of the reactant is permanently lost. \n \n == Benzene and derivatives of benzene == \n Benzene derivatives have from one to six [[substituent]]s attached to the central benzene core. Examples of benzene compounds with just one substituent are [[phenol]], which carries a [[hydroxyl]] group, and [[toluene]] with a [[methyl]] group. When there is more than one substituent present on the ring,  their spatial relationship becomes important for which the [[arene substitution patterns]] ''ortho'', ''meta'', and ''para'' are devised. For example, three [[isomer]]s exist for [[cresol]] because the methyl group and the hydroxyl group can be placed next to each other (''ortho''), one position removed from each other (''meta''), or two positions removed from each other (''para''). [[Xylenol]] has two methyl groups in addition to the hydroxyl group, and, for this structure, 6 isomers exist. \n \n < gallery caption= \" Representative arene compounds \"  perrow= \" 5 \" > \n File:toluene.svg|[[Toluene]] \n File:Ethylbenzene-2D-skeletal.png|[[Ethylbenzene]] \n File:Para-Xylol - para-xylene.svg|[[Xylene|''p''-Xylene]] \n File:Meta-Xylol_-_meta-xylene_2.svg|[[Xylene|''m''-Xylene]] \n File:1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene.svg| [[Mesitylene]] \n File:Durene.png| [[Durene]] \n File:2-phenyl-hexane.png| [[2-Phenylhexane]] \n File:Bifenyl.svg| [[Biphenyl]]  \n File:Phenol-2D-skeletal.png|[[Phenol]] \n File:Aniline.svg|[[Aniline]] \n File:Nitrobenzol.svg|[[Nitrobenzene]] \n File:Benzoic acid.svg|[[Benzoic acid]] \n File:Aspirin-skeletal.svg|[[Aspirin]] \n File:Paracetamol-skeletal.svg|[[Paracetamol]] \n File:Pikrins\u00e4ure.svg|[[Picric acid]] \n \n < /gallery > \n \n The arene ring has an ability to stabilize charges. This is seen in, for example, phenol (C < sub > 6 < /sub > H < sub > 5 < /sub > \u2013OH), which is [[acidic]] at the hydroxyl (OH), since a charge on this oxygen (alkoxide \u2013O < sup > \u2212 < /sup > ) is partially delocalized into the benzene ring. \n \n === Other monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon === \n Other monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon include [[Cyclotetradecaheptaene]] or [[Cyclooctadecanonaene]]. \n \n ==Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons== \n [[Image:Hexabenzocoronene-3D-balls.png|thumb|[[Hexabenzocoronene]] is a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.]] \n {{main|Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}} \n \n [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs) are aromatic hydrocarbons that consist of fused [[aromatic]] [[simple aromatic ring|rings]] and do not contain [[heteroatom]]s or carry [[substituent]]s. < ref > {{cite journal |last = Fetzer |first = J.

PAHs occur in [[oil]], [[coal]], and [[tar]] deposits, and are produced as byproducts of fuel burning (whether fossil fuel or biomass). As pollutants, they are of concern because some compounds have been identified as [[carcinogen]]ic, [[mutagen]]ic, and [[teratogen]]ic. PAHs are also found in cooked foods. Studies have shown that high levels of PAHs are found, for example, in meat cooked at high temperatures such as grilling or barbecuing, and in smoked fish. < ref > {{cite news |url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out154_en.pdf |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons \u2013 Occurrence in foods, dietary exposure and health effects |publisher=European Commission, Scientific Committee on Food|date=December 4, 2002}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |last=Larsson |first=B.
