Nevertheless, it was around this time that the Arab Spring greeted the region, the turmoil of which came great to al-Qaeda's regional forces. Seven years later, Ayman al-Zawahiri became arguably the number one leader in the organization, implementing his strategy with systematic consistency. Tens of thousands loyal to al-Qaeda and related organizations were able to challenge local and regional stability and ruthlessly attack their enemies in the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe and Russia alike.

During this time, bin Laden assisted the Sudanese government, bought or set up various business enterprises, and established training camps. \n \n A key turning point for bin Laden occurred in 1993 when Saudi Arabia gave support for the [[Oslo Accords]], which set a path for peace between Israel and [[Palestinians]]. < ref > {{Harvnb|Riedel|2008|p=52}}. < /ref >  Due to bin Laden's continuous verbal assault on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, Fahd sent an emissary to Sudan on March 5, 1994 demanding bin Laden's passport.

The Taliban also garnered support from graduates of Islamic schools, which are called ''madrassa''.

Four of the Taliban's leaders attended a similarly funded and influenced madrassa in Kandahar.

Two commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, a third into the Pentagon, and a fourth, originally intended to target either the [[United States Capitol]] or the [[White House]], crashed in a field in Stonycreek Township near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]]. It was also the deadliest foreign attack on American soil since the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941. \n \n The attacks were conducted by al-Qaeda, acting in accord with the [[Fataw\u0101 of Osama bin Laden#1998 Fatwa|1998 ''fatwa'']] issued against the US and its allies by persons under the command of bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and others. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm|title=Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders|access-date=June 16, 2010|date=February 23, 1998}} < /ref >  Evidence points to suicide squads led by al-Qaeda military commander [[Mohamed Atta]] as the culprits of the attacks, with bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], and [[Hambali]] as the key planners and part of the political and military command. \n \n Messages issued by bin Laden after September 11, 2001 praised the attacks, and explained their motivation while denying any involvement. < ref > {{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/inv.binladen.denial/|title=Bin Laden says he wasn't behind attacks|publisher=CNN|access-date=July 6, 2006|date=September 17, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705161654/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/inv.binladen.denial/|archive-date=July 5, 2006|url-status=live}} < /ref >  Bin Laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and Islamist Muslims, such as the general perception that the US was actively oppressing Muslims. < ref > {{Harvnb|Esposito|2002|p=22}}. < /ref > \n \n Bin Laden asserted that America was massacring Muslims in  \" [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestine]], [[Chechnya]], [[Kashmir]] and Iraq \"  and Muslims should retain the  \" right to attack in reprisal \" .
