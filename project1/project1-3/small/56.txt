He was a great favorite of his father and of the people. His charming manners, personal beauty, insinuating ways, love of pomp, and royal pretensions captivated the hearts of the people from the beginning. He lived in great style, drove in a magnificent chariot, and had fifty men run before him. \n \n Little is known of Absalom's family life, but the biblical narrative states that he had three sons and one daughter, Tamar, who is described as a beautiful woman. < ref > {{bibleref2|2 Samuel|14:27|KJV}} < /ref >  From the language of 2 Samuel 18:18, Absalom states,  \" I have no son to keep my name in remembrance \" . < ref > {{bibleref2|2 Samuel|18:18|KJV}} < /ref >  It may be that his sons died before his statement of 2 Samuel 18:18.{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|1905|p=173}} Or, as [[Matthew Henry]] suggests, Absalom's three sons may have been born ''after'' his statement. < ref > {{Cite book |title=An Exposition of the Old and New Testament |last=Henry |first=Matthew |authorlink= Matthew Henry |publisher= [[Henry George Bohn]] |year= 1853 |url= https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/eng/mhm/2-samuel-14.html |quote= It is probable that it was a good while before he had a child. Then, despairing of having one, he set up the pillar (2 Samuel 18:18) to bear up his name, but afterwards he had three sons and one daughter (2 Samuel 14:27). Or perhaps these sons, while he was hatching his rebellion, were all cut off by the righteous hand of God, and he thereupon set up that monument.}} < /ref > \n \n Aside from his daughter Tamar, Absalom had another daughter or granddaughter named [[Maacah]], < ref > {{bibleverse|2 Chronicles|11:20|KJV}} < /ref >  who later became the favorite wife of [[Rehoboam]].{{efn|A footnote in the New King James Version reads  \" Literally ''daughter'', but in the broader sense of granddaughter \" {{bibleref2|2 Chron| 11:20|NKJV}} }} Maacah was the mother of [[Abijah of Judah]] and the grandmother of [[Asa of Judah]].  She served as queen mother for Asa until he deposed her for idolatry. < ref > {{bibleref2|1 Kings|15:1-14|KJV}}{{bibleref2|2 Chron|11:20-22|KJV}}{{bibleref2|2 Chron|15:16|KJV}} < /ref > \n \n ===Murder of Amnon=== \n [[File:Leaf from the Morgan Picture Bible - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Leaf from the [[Morgan Picture Bible]],  \" Scenes from the Life of Absalom \" , c. 1250]] \n Absalom also had a sister named [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]], who was raped by their half-brother [[Amnon]], David's eldest son. After the rape, Absalom waited two years and then avenged Tamar by sending his servants to murder a drunken Amnon at a feast to which Absalom had invited all of King David's sons. < ref > {{bibleref2|2 Samuel|13|NIV}} < /ref > \n \n After this murder Absalom fled to [[Talmai]], who was the king of [[Geshur]] and Absalom's maternal grandfather. < ref > {{bibleref2|2 Samuel|13:37|NIV}}{{bibleref2|Joshua|12:5|NIV}}{{bibleref2|Joshua|13:2|NIV}} < /ref >  Not until three years later was Absalom fully reinstated in David's favour and did he finally return to Jerusalem. < ref > {{bibleref2|2 Samuel|13\u201314|NIV}} (see [[Joab]]) < /ref > \n \n ===The revolt at Hebron=== \n While at Jerusalem, Absalom built support for himself by speaking to those who came to King David for justice, saying,  \" See, your claims are good and right; but there is no one deputed by the king to hear you \" , perhaps reflecting flaws in the [[judicial system]] of the united monarchy.  \" If only I were the judge of the land! Then all who had a suit or cause might come to me, and I would give them justice. \"  He made gestures of flattery by kissing those who bowed before him instead of accepting supplication. He  \" stole the hearts of the people of Israel \" . < ref > {{bibleref2|2 Samuel|15|NRSV}} < /ref > \n \n After four years he declared himself king, raised a revolt at [[Hebron]], the former capital, and slept with his father's concubines.{{sfn|Kirk-Duggan|2004|p=59}} All Israel and Judah flocked to him, and David, attended only by the [[Cherethites]] and [[Pelethites]] and his former bodyguard, which had followed him from Gath, found it expedient to flee. The priests Zadok and Abiathar remained in Jerusalem, and their sons Jonathan and Ahimaaz served as David's spies. Absalom reached the capital and consulted with the renowned [[Ahithophel]] (sometimes spelled Achitophel). \n \n David took refuge from Absalom's forces beyond the [[Jordan River]]. However, he took the precaution of instructing a servant, [[Hushai]], to infiltrate Absalom's court and subvert it. Once in place, Hushai convinced Absalom to ignore Ahithophel's advice to attack his father while he was on the run, and instead to prepare his forces for a major attack. This gave David critical time to prepare his own troops for the battle. When Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he committed suicide by hanging himself. \n \n ===Battle of Ephraim's Wood=== \n [[File:Weltchronik Fulda Aa88 286r detail.jpg|thumb|The death of Absalom, hanging from a tree by his hair (14th-century German miniature)]] \n \n A fateful [[Battle of the Wood of Ephraim|battle]] was fought in the [[Wood of Ephraim]] (the name suggests a locality west of the Jordan) and Absalom's army was completely routed. < ref > {{bibleref2|2 Samuel|16:18}} < /ref >  When Absalom fled from David's army, his head was caught in the boughs of an oak tree as the mule he was riding ran beneath it. He was discovered there still alive by one of David's men, who reported this to [[Joab]], the king's commander. Joab, accustomed to avenging himself, took this opportunity to even the score with Absalom. < ref > {{bibleref2|2 Samuel|14:30}} < /ref >  Absalom had once set Joab's field on fire < ref > {{bibleref2|2 Samuel|17:25}} < /ref >  and then made Amasa Captain of the Host instead of Joab. Killing Absalom was against David's explicit command,  \" Beware that none touch the young man Absalom \" . Joab killed Absalom with three darts through the heart. \n \n When David heard that Absalom was killed, although not how he was killed, he greatly sorrowed. \n {{quote|O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom!

It is situated in the eastern part of the valley of Kidron, to the east of Jerusalem. In all probability it is the tomb of [[Alexander Jann\u00e6us]] (Conder, in Hastings' ''Dict. Bible'', article  \" Jerusalem \" , p. 597). It existed in the days of Josephus. < ref > \" Antiquities \"  vii. 10, \u00a7 3 < /ref > {{sfn|Singer|1901|p=134}} However, archaeologists have now dated the tomb to the 1st century AD.{{sfn|Barkat |2003}} In a 2013 conference, Professor [[Gabriel Barkay]] suggested that it could be the tomb of [[Herod Agrippa]], the grandson of [[Herod the Great]], based in part on the similarity to Herod's newly discovered tomb at [[Herodium]]. For centuries, it was the custom among passers-by\u2014Jews, Christians and [[Islam|Muslims]]\u2014to throw stones at the monument. Residents of Jerusalem would bring their unruly children to the site to teach them what became of a rebellious son.{{sfn|Vilnay|1999|p=113}} \n \n ==Rabbinic literature== \n The life and death of Absalom offered to the rabbis a welcome theme wherewith to warn the people against false ambition, vainglory, and unfilial conduct. The vanity with which he displayed his beautiful hair, the rabbis say, became his snare and his stumbling-block.  \" By his long hair the [[Nazirite]] entangled the people to rebel against his father, and by it he himself became entangled, to fall a victim to his pursuers \" . < ref > Mishnah So\u1e6dah, i. 8 < /ref >  And again, elsewhere:  \" By his vile stratagem he deceived and stole three hearts, that of his father, of the elders, and finally of the whole nation of Israel, and for this reason three darts were thrust into his heart to end his treacherous life \" . < ref > Tosef., So\u1e6dah, iii. 17 < /ref >  More striking is the following:  \" Did one ever hear of an oak-tree having a heart? And yet in the oak-tree in whose branches Absalom was caught, we read that upon its heart he was held up still alive while the darts were thrust through him. < ref > [Mek., Shirah, \u00a7 6] < /ref >  This is to show that when a man becomes so heartless as to make war against his own father, nature itself takes on a heart to avenge the deed. \" \n \n Popular legend states that the eye of Absalom was of immense size, signifying his insatiable greed. < ref > Niddah, 24b < /ref >  Indeed,  \" hell itself opened beneath him, and David, his father, cried seven times: 'My son! my son!' while bewailing his death, praying at the same time for his redemption from the seventh section of Gehenna, to which he was consigned \" . < ref > So\u1e6dah, 10b < /ref >  According to R. Meir, < ref > Sanh. 103b < /ref >   \" he has no share in the life to come \" . And according to the description of Gehenna by [[Joshua ben Levi]], who, like Dante, wandered through hell under the guidance of the angel Duma, Absalom still dwells there, having the rebellious heathen in charge; and when the angels with their fiery rods run also against Absalom to smite him like the rest, a heavenly voice says:  \" Spare Absalom, the son of David, My servant. \" {{sfn|Singer|1901|p=133}} \n \n ==Art and literature== \n [[File:Convito di Assalonne - Tornioli.png|thumb|''The Feast of Absalom'', [[Niccol\u00f2 Tornioli]], 17th century]] \n \n ===Poetry=== \n * ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]'' (1681) is a landmark poetic political satire by [[John Dryden]], using the Biblical story as a metaphor for the politics of the poet's own time.{{sfn|Thomas|2006|p=}} \n *  \" Absalom \"  by [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]] (1806\u20131867){{sfn|Willis|1845|p=}} \n *  \" Absaloms Abfall \"  by [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] ( \" The Fall of Absalom \" , trans.

Moore]] and [[Henry Kuttner]], the character Absalom is a [[child prodigy]], who does non-consensual brain surgery on his father (a former child prodigy, though not as intelligent as his son) to make the father totally focused on Absalom's success. This relates to the Biblical story of the son usurping his father.{{sfn|Webster|n.d.|p=}}{{sfn|Moore|Kuttner|2012|p=10}} \n * [[Georg Christian Lehms]], ''Des israelitischen Printzens Absolons und seiner Prinzcessin Schwester Thamar Staats- Lebens- und Helden-Geschichte'' (''The Heroic Life and History of the Israelite Prince Absolom and his Princess Sister Tamar''), novel in [[German language|German]] published in [[Nuremberg]], 1710.{{sfn|Goosen |1999|p=26}} \n * ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' is a novel by [[William Faulkner]], and refers to the return of the main character [[Thomas Sutpen]]'s son.{{sfn|Urgo|Polk|2010|p=xi}} \n * ''Oh Absalom!'' was the original title of [[Howard Spring]]'s novel ''My Son, My Son!'', later adapted for [[My Son, My Son!|the film]] of the latter name.{{sfn|Lennox|2010|p=62}} \n * ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country]]'' by [[Alan Paton]]. Absalom was the name of Stephen Kumalo's son in the novel. Like the Biblical Absalom, Absalom Kumalo was at odds with his father, the two fighting a moral and ethical battle of sorts over the course of some of the novel's most important events. Absalom kills and murders a man, and also meets an untimely death.{{sfn|Jeffrey|1992|p=14}} \n * Throughout [[Robertson Davies]]'s ''[[The Manticore]]'' a comparison is repeatedly made between the protagonist's problematic relations with his father and those of the Biblical Absalom and King David. Paradoxically, in the modern version, it is the rebellious son who has the first name  \" David \" . The book also introduces the term  \" Absalonism \" , as a generic term for a son's rebellion against his father.{{sfn|Lennox|2010|p=62}} \n * Absalom appears as a prominent character in [[Peter Shaffer]]'s play ''Yonadab'', which portrays Amnon's rape of Tamar and his murder at Absalom's hands.{{sfn|MacMurraugh-Kavanagh|1998|p=74}} \n * A scene in the Swedish writer [[Frans G. Bengtsson]]'s historical novel  \" [[The Long Ships]] \"  depicts a 10th Century Christian missionary recounting the story of Absalom's rebellion to the assembled Danish court, including the aging King [[Harald Bluetooth]] and his son [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn Forkbeard]]; thereupon, King Harald exclaims  \" Some people can learn a lesson from this story! \" , casting a meaningful glance at his son Sweyn\u2014whom the King (rightly) suspects of plotting a rebellion.{{sfn|Anon|1988|p=30}} \n * In the novel ''The Book of Tamar'' by Nel Havas, the story of Absalom is presented from the viewpoint of his sister.  While closely following the main events as related in the Bible, Havas concentrates on the motives behind Absalom's actions, which are more complex than depicted in the scriptures. \n \n ===Music=== \n * [[Josquin des Prez]] composed the [[motet]]  \" Absalon, fili mi \"  on the occasion of the death of [[Giovanni Borgia (1474)|Juan Borgia]] (Absalon being a further alternative spelling). \n * [[Nicolas Gombert|Nicholas Gombert]] composed the two-part, eight-voice motet  \" Lugebat David Absalon \" . \n * [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] (1585\u20131672) composed  \" Fili mi, Absalon \"  as part of his Sinfoniae Sacrae, op. 6. \n * The single verse, 2 Samuel 18:33, regarding David's grief at the loss of his son ( \" And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son! \" ), is the inspiration for the text of several pieces of choral music, usually entitled ''When David Heard'' (such as those by Renaissance composers [[Thomas Tomkins]] and [[Thomas Weelkes]], or modern composers [[Eric Whitacre]], Joshua Shank, and Norman Dinerstein). This verse is also used in  \" David's Lamentation \"  by [[William Billings]], first published in 1778. \n * [[Leonard Cohen]]'s poem  \" Prayer for Sunset \"  compares the setting sun to the raving Absalom, and asks whether another Joab will arrive tomorrow night to kill Absalom again. \n *  \" Absalom, Absalom \"  is a song on the 1996 Compass CD ''Making Light of It'' by singer/songwriter [[Pierce Pettis]], incorporating several elements of the biblical narrative. \n * The Australian composer [[Nigel Butterley]] set the verse in his 2008 choral work  \" Beni Avshalom \" , commissioned by the [[Sydney Chamber Choir]]. \n * During the finale of the song  \" [[Distant Early Warning (song)|Distant Early Warning]] \"  by Canadian band [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Geddy Lee]] sings,  \" Absalom, Absalom, Absalom \" ; lyrics written by drummer [[Neil Peart]]. \n * [[David Olney]]'s 2000 CD ''Omar's Blues'' includes the song  \" Absalom \" . The song depicts David grieving over the death of his son. \n * The story of Absalom is referred to several places in folk singer [[Adam Arcuragi]]'s song  \" Always Almost Crying \" . \n * The San Francisco-based band [[Om (band)|Om]] mentions Absalom in their song  \" Kapila's Theme \"  from their debut album ''[[Variations on a Theme (Om album)|Variations on a Theme]]''. \n * The garage folk band David's Doldrums references Absalom in their song,  \" My Name Is Absalom \" . The song alludes to Absalom's feelings of solemnity and abandonment of love and hope. \n * In  \" Every Kind Word \"  by [[Lackthereof]], Danny Seim's project parallel to [[Menomena]], Seim sings  \" ... & nbsp;and your hair is long like Absalom. \" \n *  \" Barach Hamelech \" , an Israeli song by Amos Etinger and Yosef Hadar. \n * The [[grindcore]] band [[Discordance Axis]] references Absalom at the end of the track entitled  \" Castration Rite \" . < !-- Don't seem to be notable, no article: * The [[progressive metal]] band from [[Barranquilla]], [[Colombia]], Absalom has his name. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://karmametalcolombian.blogspot.com/2008/04/absalom-absalom-colombian-2003.html |title=Un Alma Oculto |author=Infernal North |date=8 April 2008 |publisher=blogspot.com |access-date=13 November 2016}} < /ref >  -- > \n * In 2007 [[Ryland Angel]] released  \" Absalom \"  on Ryland Angel-Manhattan Records. \n *  \" Hanging By His Hair \"  from the 1998 ''[[Wormwood: Curious Stories from the Bible|Wormwood]]'' album by [[The Residents]] recounts Absalom's defiance and death.
