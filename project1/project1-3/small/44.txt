It is the locus of a large number of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] archaeological sites, including [[Longman Hill]], [[Kempstone Hill]], [[Catto Long Barrow]] and [[Cairn Lee]]. The area was settled in the [[Bronze Age]] by the [[Beaker culture]], who arrived from the south around 2000\u20131800 BC. < ref name=EB/ >  Stone circles and cairns were constructed predominantly in this era. In the [[Iron Age]], hill forts were built. < ref name=EB/ >  Around the 1st century AD, the [[Taexali]] people, who have left little history, were believed to have resided along the coast. < ref name=EB/ >  The [[Picts]] were the next documented inhabitants of the area, and were no later than 800\u2013900 AD. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] also were in the area during this period, as they left signs at [[Kintore, Aberdeenshire|Kintore]]. < ref name=EB/ >  Christianity influenced the inhabitants early on, and there were [[Celts|Celtic]] monasteries at [[Old Deer]] and [[Monymusk]]. < ref name=EB/ > \n \n Since [[medieval]] times there have been a number of traditional paths that crossed the [[Mounth]] (a spur of mountainous land that extends from the higher inland range to the [[North Sea]] slightly north of [[Stonehaven]]) through present-day Aberdeenshire from the Scottish Lowlands to the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. Some of the most well known and historically important [[trackway]]s are the [[Causey Mounth]] and [[Elsick Mounth]]. < ref > [[W.

[[Clan MacBeth]] and the [[House of Dunkeld|Clan Canmore]] were two of the larger clans. Macbeth fell at [[Lumphanan]] in 1057. < ref name=EB/ >  During the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] penetration, other families arrives such as [[House of Balliol]], [[Clan Bruce]], and [[Clan Cumming]] (Comyn). < ref name=EB/ >  When the fighting amongst these newcomers resulted in the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]], the English king [[Edward I]] traveled across the area twice, in 1296 and 1303. In 1307, [[Robert the Bruce]] was victorious near [[Inverurie]]. Along with his victory came new families, namely the [[Clan Forbes|Forbeses]] and the [[Clan Gordon|Gordons]]. \n \n These new families set the stage for the upcoming rivalries during the 14th and 15th centuries. < ref name=EB/ >  This rivalry grew worse during and after the Protestant Reformation, when religion was another reason for conflict between the clans. The Gordon family adhered to [[Catholicism]] and the [[Clan Forbes|Forbeses]] to [[Protestantism]].

An era began of increased agricultural and industrial progress. < ref name=EB/ >  During the 17th century, Aberdeenshire was the location of more fighting, centered on the [[Marquess of Montrose]] and the [[English Civil War]]s. < ref name=EB/ >  This period also saw increased wealth due to the increase in trade with [[Germany]], [[Poland]], and the [[Low Countries]]. < ref name=EB/ > \n \n The present council area is named after the [[Counties of Scotland|historic county]] of [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]], which has different boundaries and was abandoned as an administrative area in 1975 under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]]. It was replaced by [[Grampian Region|Grampian Regional Council]] and five district councils: [[Banff and Buchan]], [[Gordon, Scotland|Gordon]], [[Kincardine and Deeside]], [[Moray]] and the [[City of Aberdeen]]. Local government functions were shared between the two levels. In 1996, under the [[Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994]], the Banff and Buchan district, Gordon district and Kincardine and Deeside district were merged to form the present Aberdeenshire council area.
