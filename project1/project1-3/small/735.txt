During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress. \n \n From its outset, Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of [[Cubism]] and the [[Vienna Secession]]; the bright colors of [[Fauvism]] and of the [[Ballets Russes]]; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of [[Louis Philippe I]] and [[Louis XVI]]; and the exotic styles of [[Chinese art|China]] and [[Japanese art|Japan]], [[Indian art|India]], [[Persian art|Persia]], [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]] and [[ancient Maya art|Maya art]]. It featured rare and expensive materials, such as ebony and ivory, and exquisite craftsmanship. The [[Chrysler Building]] and [[Art Deco architecture of New York City|other skyscrapers of New York City built during the 1920s and 1930s]] are monuments of the Art Deco style. \n \n In the 1930s, during the [[Great Depression]], Art Deco became more subdued. New materials arrived, including [[chrome plating]], [[stainless steel]], and [[plastic]]. A sleeker form of the style, called [[Streamline Moderne]], appeared in the 1930s; it featured curving forms and smooth, polished surfaces. < ref > Renaut, Christophe and Laz\u00e9, Christophe, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot, pages 110\u2013116 < /ref >  Art Deco is one of the first truly international styles, but its dominance ended with the beginning of [[World War II]] and the rise of the strictly functional and unadorned styles of [[modern architecture]] and the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] of architecture that followed.{{Sfn|Benton, Benton and Wood|''Art D\u00e9co (1910\u20131939)''|2010|pages=13\u201328}} \n \n ==Naming== \n Art Deco took its name, short for ''arts d\u00e9coratifs'', from the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs et Industriels Modernes]] held in Paris in 1925,{{Sfn|Benton|Benton|Wood|Baddeley|2003|page=16}} though the diverse styles that characterize Art Deco had already appeared in [[Paris]] and [[Brussels]] before [[World War I]]. \n \n The term ''arts d\u00e9coratifs'' was first used in France in 1858; published in the ''Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise de photographie''. < ref > [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k111368q  \" M.

The term ''arts d\u00e9coratifs'' had been invented in 1875, giving the designers of furniture, textiles, and other decoration official status. The ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des artistes d\u00e9corateurs'' (Society of Decorative Artists), or SAD, was founded in 1901, and decorative artists were given the same rights of authorship as painters and sculptors. A similar movement developed in Italy. The first international exhibition devoted entirely to the decorative arts, the ''[[Prima Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna|Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna]]'', was held in [[Turin]] in 1902. Several new magazines devoted to decorative arts were founded in Paris, including ''Arts et d\u00e9coration'' and ''L'Art d\u00e9coratif moderne''. Decorative arts sections were introduced into the annual salons of the ''Soci\u00e9te des artistes fran\u00e7ais'', and later in the'' [[Salon d'Automne]]''. French nationalism also played a part in the resurgence of decorative arts; French designers felt challenged by the increasing exports of less expensive German furnishings. In 1911, the SAD proposed the holding of a major new international exposition of decorative arts in 1912. No copies of old styles were to be permitted; only modern works. The exhibit was postponed until 1914, then, because of the war, postponed until 1925, when it gave its name to the whole family of styles known as  \" D\u00e9co \" .{{Sfn|Benton|2002|pages=165\u2013170}} \n \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:Art Deco table, chairs, carpet.jpg|Table and chairs by [[Maurice Dufr\u00eane]] and carpet by [[Paul Follot]] at the 1912 [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des artistes d\u00e9corateurs|Salon des artistes d\u00e9corateurs]] \n File:\u2018Lady with Panther\u2019 by George Barbier for Cartier, 1914.jpg|''Lady with Panther'' by [[George Barbier (illustrator)|George Barbier]] for [[Louis Cartier]], 1914.

Other designers, including [[\u00c9mile-Jacques Ruhlmann]] and Paul Foliot refused to use mass production, and insisted that each piece be made individually by hand. The early Art Deco style featured luxurious and exotic materials such as [[ebony]], [[ivory]] and [[silk]], very bright colors and stylized [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]], particularly baskets and bouquets of flowers of all colors, giving a modernist look. < ref name= \" benton165 \" > Laurent, Stephane,  \" L'artiste d\u00e9corateur \" , in ''Art Deco, 1910\u20131939'' by Charlotte Benton, Tim Benton and Ghislain Wood (2002), Renaissance du Livre, pages 165\u2013171 < /ref > \n \n ===Vienna Secession and Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte (1905\u20131911)=== \n The architects of the [[Vienna Secession]] (formed 1897), especially [[Josef Hoffmann]], had a notable influence on Art Deco. His [[Stoclet Palace]], in Brussels (1905\u20131911), was a prototype of the Art Deco style, featuring geometric volumes, symmetry, straight lines, concrete covered with marble plaques, finely-sculpted ornament, and lavish interiors, including mosaic friezes by [[Gustav Klimt]]. Hoffmann was also a founder of the [[Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte]] (1903\u20131932), an association of craftsmen and interior designers working in the new style. This became the model for the ''Compagnie des arts fran\u00e7ais'', created in 1919, which brought together [[Andr\u00e9 Mare]], and [[Louis S\u00fce]], the first leading French Art Deco designers and decorators. < ref > Texier, Simon, ''Art D\u00e9co'' (2019), pg. 5-7 < /ref > \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:20120923 Brussels PalaisStoclet Hoffmann DSC06725 PtrQs.jpg|[[Stoclet Palace]], [[Brussels]], Belgium, by [[Josef Hoffmann]] (1905\u201311) \n File:Bruxelles - Palais Stoclet (6).jpg|Detail of the fa\u00e7ade, made of reinforced concrete covered with marble plaques \n < /gallery > \n \n ===New materials and technologies=== \n New materials and technologies, especially [[reinforced concrete]], were key to the development and appearance of Art Deco. The first concrete house was built in 1853 in the Paris suburbs by [[Fran\u00e7ois Coignet]]. In 1877 [[Joseph Monier]] introduced the idea of strengthening the concrete with a mesh of iron rods in a grill pattern. In 1893 [[Auguste Perret]] built the first concrete garage in Paris, then an apartment building, house, then, in 1913, the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]]. The theatre was denounced by one critic as the  \" Zeppelin of Avenue Montaigne \" , an alleged Germanic influence, copied from the [[Vienna Secession]]. Thereafter, the majority of Art Deco buildings were made of reinforced concrete, which gave greater freedom of form and less need for reinforcing pillars and columns. Perret was also a pioneer in covering the concrete with ceramic tiles, both for protection and decoration. The architect [[Le Corbusier]] first learned the uses of reinforced concrete working as a draftsman in Perret's studio.{{sfn|Cabanne|1986|page=225}} \n \n Other new technologies that were important to Art Deco were new methods in producing plate glass, which was less expensive and allowed much larger and stronger windows, and for mass-producing [[aluminum]], which was used for building and window frames and later, by Corbusier and others, for lightweight furniture. \n \n ===Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es (1910\u20131913)=== \n {{Main|Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es}} \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es DSC09330.jpg|[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]], by [[Auguste Perret]], 15 avenue Montaigne, [[Paris]] (1910\u201313).

Previously, [[reinforced concrete]] had been used only for industrial and apartment buildings, Perret had built the first modern reinforced-concrete apartment building in Paris on rue Benjamin Franklin in 1903\u201304. [[Henri Sauvage]], another important future Art Deco architect, built another in 1904 at 7, rue Tr\u00e9taigne (1904). From 1908 to 1910, the 21-year-old Le Corbusier worked as a draftsman in Perret's office, learning the techniques of concrete construction. Perret's building had clean rectangular form, geometric decoration and straight lines, the future trademarks of Art Deco. The decor of the theater was also revolutionary; the facade was decorated with [[High-relief|high reliefs]] by [[Antoine Bourdelle]], a dome by [[Maurice Denis]], paintings by [[\u00c9douard Vuillard]], and an Art Deco curtain by [[Ker-Xavier Roussel]]. The theater became famous as the venue for many of the first performances of the [[Ballets Russes]]. < ref name= \" Bevis Hillier \" > [https://archive.org/details/styleofcentury1900hill/page/62/mode/2up?q=cubism Bevis Hillier, ''The style of the century, 1900-1980''], Dutton, New York, 1983, pp. 62, 67, 70 < /ref >  Perret and Sauvage became the leading Art Deco architects in Paris in the 1920s. < ref > Peter Collins, ''Concrete: The Vision of a New Architecture'', New York: Horizon Press, 1959 < /ref > {{Sfn|Poisson|2009|pages=318\u2013319}} \n \n ===Salon d'Automne (1912\u20131913)=== \n {{Main|Salon d'Automne}} \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov) 02 by L.

For the two rooms, Mare designed the wallpaper, which featured stylized roses and floral patterns, along with upholstery, furniture and carpets, all with flamboyant and colorful motifs. It was a distinct break from traditional decor. The critic Emile Sedeyn described Mare's work in the magazine ''Art et D\u00e9coration'':  \" He does not embarrass himself with simplicity, for he multiplies flowers wherever they can be put. The effect he seeks is obviously one of picturesqueness and gaiety. He achieves it. \" {{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=52}} The Cubist element was provided by the paintings.

Nothing was cheap about Art Deco: pieces of furniture included ivory and silver inlays, and pieces of Art Deco jewelry combined diamonds with platinum, jade, and other precious materials. The style was used to decorate the first-class salons of ocean liners, deluxe trains, and skyscrapers. It was used around the world to decorate the great movie palaces of the late 1920s and 1930s. Later, after the [[Great Depression]], the style changed and became more sober. \n \n A good example of the luxury style of Art Deco is the boudoir of the fashion designer [[Jeanne Lanvin]], designed by [[Armand-Albert Rateau]] (1882\u20131938) made between 1922 and 1925. It was located in her house at 16 rue Barbet de Jouy, in Paris, which was demolished in 1965. The room was reconstructed in the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris. The walls are covered with molded ''lambris'' below sculpted bas-reliefs in stucco. The alcove is framed with columns of marble on bases and a plinth of sculpted wood. The floor is of white and black marble, and in the cabinets decorative objects are displayed against a background of blue silk. Her bathroom had a tub and washstand made of sienna marble, with a wall of carved stucco and bronze fittings.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=82}} \n \n By 1928 the style had become more comfortable, with deep leather club chairs. The study designed by the Paris firm of Alavoine for an American businessman in 1928\u201330, now in the [[Brooklyn Museum]]. \n \n By the 1930s, the style had been somewhat simplified, but it was still extravagant. In 1932 the decorator Paul Ruoud made the Glass Salon for Suzanne Talbot. It featured a serpentine armchair and two tubular armchairs by Eileen Gray, a floor of mat silvered glass slabs, a panel of abstract patterns in silver and black lacquer, and an assortment of animal skins.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=77}} \n \n ==International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts (1925)== \n {{main|International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts}} \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:Postcard of Exposition des Art Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes.jpg|Postcard of the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in [[Paris]], France (1925) \n File:Paris-FR-75-Expo 1925 Arts d\u00e9coratifs-entr\u00e9e Place de la Concorde.jpg|Entrance to the 1925 Exposition from [[Place de la Concorde]] by [[Pierre Patout]] \n File:Paris 1925 59878912.jpg|Polish pavilion (1925) \n File:Paris-FR-75-Expo 1925 Arts d\u00e9coratifs-pavillon des Galeries Lafayette.jpg|Pavilion of the [[Galeries Lafayette]] Department Store at the 1925 Exposition \n File:Hotel du Collectionneur , Exposition des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes (1925).jpg|The Hotel du Collectionneur, pavilion of the furniture manufacturer [[\u00c9mile-Jacques Ruhlmann]], designed by [[Pierre Patout]]. \n File:Salon of the Hotel du Collectionneur (1925).jpg|Salon of the H\u00f4tel du Collectionneur from the 1925 International Exposition of Decorative Arts, furnished by [[\u00c9mile-Jacques Ruhlmann]], painting by [[Jean Dupas]], design by [[Pierre Patout]] \n < /gallery > \n \n The event that marked the zenith of the style and gave it its name was the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] which took place in Paris from April to October in 1925. This was officially sponsored by the French government, and covered a site in Paris of 55 acres, running from the [[Grand Palais]] on the right bank to [[Les Invalides]] on the left bank, and along the banks of the Seine. The Grand Palais, the largest hall in the city, was filled with exhibits of decorative arts from the participating countries. There were 15,000 exhibitors from twenty different countries, including England, Italy, Spain, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Japan, and the new [[Soviet Union]], though Germany was not invited because of tensions after the war and the United States, misunderstanding the purpose of the exhibit, declined to participate. It was visited by sixteen million people during its seven-month run. The rules of the exhibition required that all work be modern; no historical styles were allowed. The main purpose of the Exhibit was to promote the French manufacturers of luxury furniture, porcelain, glass, metal work, textiles and other decorative products. To further promote the products, all the major Paris department stores and major designers had their own pavilions. The Exposition had a secondary purpose in promoting products from French colonies in Africa and Asia, including ivory and exotic woods. \n \n The H\u00f4tel du Collectionneur was a popular attraction at the Exposition; it displayed the new furniture designs of Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, as well as Art Deco fabrics, carpets, and a painting by [[Jean Dupas]]. The interior design followed the same principles of symmetry and geometric forms which set it apart from Art Nouveau, and bright colors, fine craftsmanship rare and expensive materials which set it apart from the strict functionality of the Modernist style. While most of the pavilions were lavishly decorated and filled with hand-made luxury furniture, two pavilions, those of the Soviet Union and Pavilion du Nouveau Esprit, built by the magazine of that name run by Le Corbusier, were built in an austere style with plain white walls and no decoration; they were among the earliest examples of [[modernist architecture]].{{Sfn|Charles|2013|pages=35\u2013104}} \n \n ==Skyscrapers== \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:NYC - American Radiator Building.jpg|The [[American Radiator Building]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|N.Y.]], by [[Raymond Hood]] (1924) \n File:Chrysler Building by David Shankbone Retouched.jpg|[[Chrysler Building]], New York City, by [[William Van Alen]] (1930) \n File:USS Akron (ZRS-4) in flight over Manhattan, circa 1931-1933.jpg|New York City's skyline ({{circa|1931\u201333}}) \n File:570 Lexington Avenue2.JPG|Crown of the [[General Electric Building]] (also known as 570 Lexington Avenue), New York City, by [[Cross  &  Cross]] (1933) \n File:30RockConstruction1933.jpg|[[30 Rockefeller Plaza]], New York City, by [[Raymond Hood]] (1933) \n File:Empire State Building (aerial view).jpg|[[Empire State Building]], New York City, by [[Shreve, Lamb  &  Harmon]] (1931) \n < /gallery > \n \n American skyscrapers marked the summit of the Art Deco style; they became the tallest and most recognizable modern buildings in the world. They were designed to show the prestige of their builders through their height, their shape, their color, and their dramatic illumination at night. < ref > John Burchard and Albert Bush Brown, ''The Architecture of America'' (1966), Atlantic, Little and Brown, page 277 < /ref >  The [[American Radiator Building]] by [[Raymond Hood]] (1924) combined Gothic and Deco modern elements in the design of the building. Black brick on the frontage of the building (symbolizing coal) was selected to give an idea of solidity and to give the building a solid mass. Other parts of the facade were covered in gold bricks (symbolizing fire), and the entry was decorated with marble and black mirrors. Another early Art Deco skyscraper was Detroit's [[Guardian Building]], which opened in 1929. Designed by modernist [[Wirt C. Rowland]], the building was the first to employ stainless steel as a decorative element, and the extensive use of colored designs in place of traditional ornaments. \n \n New York City's skyline was radically changed by the [[Chrysler Building]] in Manhattan (completed in 1930), designed by [[William Van Alen]]. It was a giant seventy-seven-floor tall advertisement for Chrysler automobiles. The top was crowned by a stainless steel spire, and was ornamented by deco  \" gargoyles \"  in the form of stainless steel radiator cap decorations. The base of the tower, thirty-three stories above the street, was decorated with colorful art deco friezes, and the lobby was decorated with art deco symbols and images expressing modernity.{{Sfn|Benton|202|pages=249\u2013258}} \n \n The Chrysler Building was followed by the [[Empire State Building]] by [[William F. Lamb]] (1931) and the [[RCA Building]] (now 30 Rockefeller Plaza) by Raymond Hood (1933) which together completely changed New York City's skyline. The tops of the buildings were decorated with Art Deco crowns and spires covered with stainless steel, and, in the case of the Chrysler building, with Art Deco gargoyles modeled after radiator ornaments, while the entrances and lobbies were lavishly decorated with Art Deco sculpture, ceramics, and design. Similar buildings, though not quite as tall, soon appeared in Chicago and other large American cities. The Chrysler Building was soon surpassed in height by the Empire State Building, in a slightly less lavish Deco style. Rockefeller Center added a new design element: several tall buildings grouped around an open plaza, with a fountain in the center.{{Sfn|Morel|2012|pages=125\u201330}} \n \n ==Late Art Deco== \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:Miami Beach FL Lincoln Mall Lincoln Theatre01.jpg|[[Lincoln Theatre (Miami Beach, Florida)|Lincoln Theater]] in [[Miami Beach, Florida]], by [[Thomas W.

On the other side were the modernists, who increasingly rejected the past and wanted a style based upon advances in new technologies, simplicity, a lack of decoration, inexpensive materials, and mass production. The modernists founded their own organization, [[The French Union of Modern Artists]], in 1929. Its members included architects [[Pierre Chareau]], [[Francis Jourdain]], [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], Corbusier, and, in the Soviet Union, [[Konstantin Melnikov]]; the Irish designer Eileen Gray, and French designer Sonia Delaunay, the jewelers [[Jean Fouquet]] and [[Jean Puiforcat]]. They fiercely attacked the traditional art deco style, which they said was created only for the wealthy, and insisted that well-constructed buildings should be available to everyone, and that form should follow function. The beauty of an object or building resided in whether it was perfectly fit to fulfill its function. Modern industrial methods meant that furniture and buildings could be mass-produced, not made by hand. < ref > Le Corbusier, ''Vers une architecture'', Flammarion, republished in 1995, page xix < /ref > < ref > Larousse Encyclopedia on-line edition (in French) < /ref > \n \n The Art Deco interior designer Paul Follot defended Art Deco in this way:  \" We know that man is never content with the indispensable and that the superfluous is always needed...If not, we would have to get rid of music, flowers, and perfumes..! \" {{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=8}} However, Le Corbusier was a brilliant publicist for modernist architecture; he stated that a house was simply  \" a machine to live in \" , and tirelessly promoted the idea that Art Deco was the past and modernism was the future. Le Corbusier's ideas were gradually adopted by architecture schools, and the aesthetics of Art Deco were abandoned. The same features that made Art Deco popular in the beginning, its craftsmanship, rich materials and ornament, led to its decline. The Great Depression that began in the United States in 1929, and reached Europe shortly afterwards, greatly reduced the number of wealthy clients who could pay for the furnishings and art objects. In the Depression economic climate, few companies were ready to build new skyscrapers. < ref name= \" Goss \"  / >  Even the Ruhlmann firm resorted to producing pieces of furniture in series, rather than individual hand-made items. The last buildings built in Paris in the new style were the Museum of Public Works by Auguste Perret (now the [[French Economic, Social and Environmental Council]]) and the [[Palais de Chaillot]] by [[Louis-Hippolyte Boileau]], [[Jacques Carlu]] and [[L\u00e9on Az\u00e9ma]], and the [[Palais de Tokyo]] of the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 Paris International Exposition]]; they looked out at the grandiose pavilion of Nazi Germany, designed by [[Albert Speer]], which faced the equally grandiose socialist-realist pavilion of Stalin's Soviet Union. \n \n After World War II, the dominant architectural style became the International Style pioneered by Le Corbusier, and [[Mies Van der Rohe]]. A handful of Art Deco hotels were built in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] after World War II, but elsewhere the style largely vanished, except in industrial design, where it continued to be used in automobile styling and products such as jukeboxes. In the 1960s, it experienced a modest academic revival, thanks in part to the writings of architectural historians such as Bevis Hillier. In the 1970s efforts were made in the United States and Europe to preserve the best examples of Art Deco architecture, and many buildings were restored and repurposed. [[Postmodern architecture]], which first appeared in the 1980s, like Art Deco, often includes purely decorative features. < ref name= \" Goss \"  / > < ref name= \" Art Deco Style \"  / > < ref name= \" Design Handbook \" > {{cite book |last=Fell | first=Charlotte |first2=Peter |last2=Fell |title=Design Handbook: Concepts, Materials and Styles |publisher=Taschen |year=2006 |edition=1 }} < /ref > < ref name= \" Art Deco (1920s to 1930s) \" > {{cite web|url=http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |title=Art Deco (1920s to 1930s) |last=Heindorf |first=Anne |date=24 July 2006 |access-date=6 November 2008 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080207022236/http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |archive-date=7 February 2008 |url-status = dead }} < /ref >  Deco continues to inspire designers, and is often used in contemporary fashion, jewelry, and toiletries. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-NUN/uploads/approved/adt-NUN20060515.093519/public/02whole.pdf |title=The Decorative in Twentieth Century Art: A Story of Decline and Resurgence |first=Pamela |last=Gaunt |date=August 2005 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217013725/http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-NUN/uploads/approved/adt-NUN20060515.093519/public/02whole.pdf |archive-date=17 December 2008  }} < /ref > \n \n ==Painting== \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:Entrance of Rockefeller Center.JPG|Detail of ''Time'', ceiling mural in lobby of [[Rockefeller Center]] ([[New York City]], [[New York (state)|N.Y.]]), by the Spanish painter [[Josep Maria Sert]] (1941) \n File:Mural-Ariel-Rios-Marsh-1.jpg|''Workers sorting the mail'', a mural in the U.S. Customs House, New York City, by [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]] (1936) \n File:Mural-Ariel-Rios-Rockwell-Kent-1.jpg|''Art in the Tropics'', mural in the [[William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building]], [[Washington, D.C.]], by [[Rockwell Kent]] (1938) \n < /gallery > \n \n There was no section set aside for painting at the 1925 Exposition. Art deco painting was by definition decorative, designed to decorate a room or work of architecture, so few painters worked exclusively in the style, but two painters are closely associated with Art Deco. Jean Dupas painted Art Deco murals for the Bordeaux Pavilion at the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition in Paris, and also painted the picture over the fireplace in the Maison de la Collectioneur exhibit at the 1925 Exposition, which featured furniture by Ruhlmann and other prominent Art Deco designers. His murals were also prominent in the decor of the French ocean liner [[SS Normandie|SS ''Normandie'']]. His work was purely decorative, designed as a background or accompaniment to other elements of the decor. < ref > Louis Ren\u00e9 Vian, ''Les Arts d\u00e9coratifs \u00e0 bord des paquebots fran\u00e7ais'', \u00c9ditions Fonmare, 1992 < /ref > \n \n The other painter closely associated with the style is [[Tamara de Lempicka]]. Born in Poland, she emigrated to Paris after the [[Russian Revolution]]. She studied under [[Maurice Denis]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Lhote]], and borrowed many elements from their styles. She painted portraits in a realistic, dynamic and colorful Art Deco style. < ref > Blondel, Alain (1999). ''Tamara de Lempicka: a Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 1921\u20131980''. Lausanne: Editions Acatos. < /ref > \n \n In the 1930s a dramatic new form of Art Deco painting appeared in the United States. During the Great Depression, the [[Federal Art Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration]] was created to give work to unemployed artists. Many were given the task of decorating government buildings, hospitals and schools. There was no specific art deco style used in the murals; artists engaged to paint murals in government buildings came from many different schools, from American regionalism to [[social realism]]; they included [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Rockwell Kent]] and the Mexican painter [[Diego Rivera]]. The murals were Art Deco because they were all decorative and related to the activities in the building or city where they were painted: Reginald Marsh and Rockwell Kent both decorated U.S. postal buildings, and showed postal employees at work while Diego Rivera depicted automobile factory workers for the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. Diego Rivera's mural ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'' (1933) for Rockefeller Center featured an unauthorized portrait of [[Lenin]]. < ref > Balfour, Alan (1978).

In the 1930s, a large group of prominent sculptors made works for the 1937 [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]] at Chaillot. [[Alfred Janniot]] made the relief sculptures on the fa\u00e7ade of the Palais de Tokyo. The [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]], and the esplanade in front of the Palais de Chaillot, facing the Eiffel Tower, was crowded with new statuary by [[Charles Malfray]], Henry Arnold, and many others.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=165\u201366}} \n \n Public art deco sculpture was almost always representational, usually of heroic or allegorical figures related to the purpose of the building or room. The themes were usually selected by the patrons, not the artist. Abstract sculpture for decoration was extremely rare. < ref > [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0671808044 Eva Weber, ''Art deco in America''], Exeter Books, 1985, p. 32, {{ISBN|0671808044}} < /ref > < ref > Duncan, Alistair, ''Art Deco'', p. 121-141 < /ref > \n \n In the United States, the most prominent Art Deco sculptor for public art was [[Paul Manship]], who updated classical and mythological subjects and themes in an Art Deco style. His most famous work was the statue of [[Prometheus (Manship)|Prometheus]] at [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City, a 20th-century adaptation of a classical subject. Other important works for Rockefeller Center were made by [[Lee Lawrie]], including the sculptural facade and the [[Atlas (statue)|Atlas statue]]. \n \n During the [[Great Depression]] in the United States, many sculptors were commissioned to make works for the decoration of federal government buildings, with funds provided by the WPA, or [[Works Progress Administration]]. They included sculptor Sidney Biehler Waugh, who created stylized and idealized images of workers and their tasks for federal government office buildings. < ref > Duncan, ''Art Deco'' (1988), pg. 140 < /ref >  In San Francisco, [[Ralph Stackpole]] provided sculpture for the facade of the new [[San Francisco Stock Exchange]] building. In Washington DC, [[Michael Lantz]] made works for the [[Federal Trade Commission]] building. \n \n In Britain, Deco public statuary was made by [[Eric Gill]] for the [[BBC Broadcasting House]], while Ronald Atkinson decorated the lobby of the former [[Daily Express Building, London|Daily Express Building]] in London (1932). \n \n One of the best known and certainly the largest public Art Deco sculpture is the ''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' by the French sculptor [[Paul Landowski]], completed between 1922 and 1931, located on a mountain top overlooking [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. \n \n ===Studio sculpture=== \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:Joseph Csaky, T\u00eate, ca 1920 (front and side view) limestone, 60 cm, Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum, Otterlo, Holland.tiff|''T\u00eate'' (front and side view), limestone, by [[Joseph Csaky]] ({{circa|1920}}) ([[Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum]], [[Otterlo]], Netherlands) \n File:Le chasseur de Pierre Le Faguays.png|''The Hunter'' by Pierre Le Faguays (1920s) \n File:Josef Lorenzl00.jpg|Bronze nude of a dancer on an onyx plinth by [[Josef Lorenzl]] ({{circa|1925}}) \n File:Speed - Harriet Frishmuth.jpg|''Speed'', a design for a radiator ornament by [[Harriet Whitney Frishmuth]] (1925) \n File:The Flight of Europa.jpg|''The Flight of Europa'', bronze with gold leaf, by [[Paul Manship]] (1925) ([[Whitney Museum of American Art]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|N.Y.]]) \n File:Art Deco Sculpture.jpg|''T\u00e2n\u0103r\u0103'' (Girl), bronze, ivory and onyx, by [[Dem\u00e9tre Chiparus]] ({{circa|1925}}) \n File:Demetre Chiparus 2.jpg|''Dansatoare'' (Dancer), bronze and ivory, by Chiparus ({{circa|1925}}) \n < /gallery > \n \n Many early Art Deco sculptures were small, designed to decorate salons.

In the 1920s, the look changed; the fashions stressed were more casual, sportive and daring, with the woman models usually smoking cigarettes. American fashion magazines such as ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' quickly picked up the new style and popularized it in the United States. It also influenced the work of American book illustrators such as Rockwell Kent. In Germany, the most famous poster artist of the period was [[Ludwig Hohlwein]], who created colorful and dramatic posters for music festivals, beers, and, late in his career, for the Nazi Party.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=148\u2013150}} \n \n During the Art Nouveau period, posters usually advertised theatrical products or cabarets. In the 1920s, travel posters, made for steamship lines and airlines, became extremely popular. The style changed notably in the 1920s, to focus attention on the product being advertised. The images became simpler, precise, more linear, more dynamic, and were often placed against a single color background. In France, popular Art Deco designers included, Charles Loupot and [[Paul Colin (artist)|Paul Colin]], who became famous for his posters of American singer and dancer [[Josephine Baker]]. Jean Carlu designed posters for Charlie Chaplin movies, soaps, and theaters; in the late 1930s he emigrated to the United States, where, during the World War, he designed posters to encourage war production. The designer Charles Gesmar became famous making posters for the singer [[Mistinguett]] and for [[Air France]]. Among the best known French Art Deco poster designers was [[Cassandre (artist)|Cassandre]], who made the celebrated poster of the ocean liner SS ''Normandie'' in 1935.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=148\u2013150}} \n \n In the 1930s a new genre of posters appeared in the United States during the Great Depression.

The two young architects used reinforced concrete for the first time in Paris residential buildings; the new buildings had clean lines, rectangular forms, and no decoration on the facades; they marked a clean break with the [[Art Nouveau|art nouveau]] style.{{Sfn|Poisson|2009|pages 299 and 318}} Between 1910 and 1913, Perret used his experience in concrete apartment buildings to construct the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, 15 [[avenue Montaigne]]. Between 1925 and 1928 he constructed the new art deco facade of the [[La Samaritaine]] department store in Paris.{{Sfn|Plum|2014|page=134}} \n \n After the First World War, art deco buildings of steel and reinforced concrete began to appear in large cities across Europe and the United States. In the United States the style was most commonly used for office buildings, government buildings, movie theaters, and railroad stations. It sometimes was combined with other styles; [[Los Angeles City Hall]] combined Art Deco with a roof based on the ancient Greek [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]], while the [[Los Angeles railroad station]] combined Deco with Spanish mission architecture. Art Deco elements also appeared in engineering projects, including the towers of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and the intake towers of [[Hoover Dam]]. In the 1920s and 1930s it became a truly international style, with examples including the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] (Palace of Fine Arts) in [[Mexico City]] by {{Interlanguage link|Federico Mariscal (architect)|es|Federico Ernesto Mariscal Pi\u00f1a|lt=Federico Mariscal}}, the [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya Metro Station]] in [[Moscow]] and the [[National Diet Building]] in Tokyo by Watanabe Fukuzo.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} \n \n The Art Deco style was not limited to buildings on land; the ocean liner SS ''Normandie'', whose first voyage was in 1935, featured Art Deco design, including a dining room whose ceiling and decoration were made of glass by [[Lalique]]. < ref > Ardman, pp. 86-87 < /ref > \n \n === \" Cathedrals of Commerce \" === \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:Interior of Fisher Building, Detroit.JPG|The [[Fisher Building]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], by [[Joseph Nathaniel French]] (1928) \n File:Detroit December 2015 30 (Guardian Building).jpg|Lower lobby of the [[Guardian Building]] in Detroit by [[Wirt Rowland]] (1929) \n File:450 Sutter St. lobby 2.JPG|Lobby of [[450 Sutter Street]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], by [[Timothy Pflueger]] (1929) \n File:Chrysler Building Lobby.jpg|Lobby of the [[Chrysler Building]] in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|N.Y.]], by [[William Van Alen]] (1930) \n File:Chrysler Building 01.JPG|Elevator of the Chrysler Building (1930) \n < /gallery > \n \n The grand showcases of Art deco interior design were the lobbies of government buildings, theaters, and particularly office buildings. Interiors were extremely colorful and dynamic, combining sculpture, murals, and ornate geometric design in marble, glass, ceramics and stainless steel. An early example was the [[Fisher Building]] in Detroit, by [[Joseph Nathaniel French]]; the lobby was highly decorated with sculpture and ceramics. The [[Guardian Building]] (originally the Union Trust Building) in Detroit, by [[Wirt Rowland]] (1929), decorated with red and black marble and brightly colored ceramics, highlighted by highly polished steel elevator doors and counters. The sculptural decoration installed in the walls illustrated the virtues of industry and saving; the building was immediately termed the  \" Cathedral of Commerce \" . The Medical and Dental Building called [[450 Sutter Street]] in San Francisco by [[Timothy Pflueger]] was inspired by [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] architecture, in a highly stylized form; it used pyramid shapes, and the interior walls were covered highly stylized rows of hieroglyphs.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=198\u2013200}} \n \n In France, the best example of an Art Deco interior during period was the [[Palais de la Porte Dor\u00e9e]] (1931) by [[Albert Laprade]], [[L\u00e9on Jaussely]] and [[L\u00e9on Bazin]]. The building (now the National Museum of Immigration, with an aquarium in the basement) was built for the [[Paris Colonial Exposition]] of 1931, to celebrate the people and products of French colonies. The exterior facade was entirely covered with sculpture, and the lobby created an Art Deco harmony with a wood parquet floor in a geometric pattern, a mural depicting the people of French colonies; and a harmonious composition of vertical doors and horizontal balconies.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=198\u2013200}} \n \n ===Movie palaces=== \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:Graumanegyptian-opening1922.jpg|[[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]] ([[Los Angeles]]), [[California]] (1922) \n File:Paramount Fountain of Light in Lobby.jpg|Four-story high grand lobby of the Paramount Theatre in [[Oakland]], California (1932) \n File:Radio City Music Hall 3051638324 4a385c5623.jpg|Auditorium and stage of [[Radio City Music Hall]] in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|N.Y.]] (1932) \n File:Facade Rex.jpg|[[Grand Rex]] in [[Paris]], France (1932) \n File:Gaumont State Cinema Entrance.jpg|[[Gaumont State Cinema]] in [[London]], UK (1937) \n File:The Paramount, Shanghai.JPG|The [[Paramount (Shanghai)|Paramount]] in [[Shanghai]], China (1933) \n < /gallery > \n \n Many of the best surviving examples of Art Deco are movie theaters built in the 1920s and 1930s. The Art Deco period coincided with the conversion of silent films to sound, and movie companies built enormous theaters in major cities to capture the huge audience that came to see movies. Movie palaces in the 1920s often combined exotic themes with art deco style; [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]] in Hollywood (1922) was inspired by ancient Egyptian [[tomb]]s and [[pyramid]]s, while the [[Fox Theater (Bakersfield, California)|Fox Theater]] in Bakersfield, California attached a tower in California Mission style to an Art Deco hall. The largest of all is [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City, which opened in 1932. Originally designed as a stage theater, it quickly transformed into a movie theater, which could seat 6,015 persons. The interior design by [[Donald Deskey]] used glass, aluminum, chrome, and leather to create a colorful escape from reality. The [[Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theatre]] in Oakland, California, by Timothy Pflueger, had a colorful ceramic facade a lobby four stories high, and separate Art Deco smoking rooms for gentlemen and ladies. Similar grand palaces appeared in Europe. The [[Grand Rex]] in Paris (1932), with its imposing tower, was the largest movie theater in Europe. The [[Gaumont State Cinema]] in London (1937) had a tower modeled after the Empire State building, covered with cream-colored ceramic tiles and an interior in an Art Deco-Italian Renaissance style. The [[Paramount (Shanghai)|Paramount]] Theater in [[Shanghai]], China (1933) was originally built as a dance hall called ''The gate of 100 pleasures''; it was converted to a movie theater after the Communist Revolution in 1949, and now is a ballroom and disco. In the 1930s Italian architects built a small movie palace, the Cinema Impero, in [[Asmara]] in what is now [[Eritrea]]. Today, many of the movie theaters have been subdivided into multiplexes, but others have been restored and are used as cultural centers in their communities.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=197\u2013199}} \n \n ===Streamline Moderne=== \n {{Main|Streamline Moderne}} \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:Broadcasting House by Stephen Craven.jpg|The nautical-style rounded corner of [[BBC Broadcasting House]] in [[London]], UK (1931) \n File:Immeuble de Pierre Patout Bd Victor Paris XV.jpg|Paris' building in the ''Paquebot'' or ocean liner style, 3 boulevard Victor, by [[Pierre Patout]] (1935) \n File:Pan-Pacific Auditorium entrance.jpg|[[Pan-Pacific Auditorium]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] (1936) \n File:LaGuardia MarineAirTerminal 1974.jpg|The [[Marine Air Terminal]] at [[La Guardia Airport]] (1937) was [[New York City]]'s terminal for the flights of Pan Am Clipper flying boats to Europe \n File:Hoover Building No 1.jpg|The [[Hoover Building]] canteen in [[Perivale]] in London's suburbs, by Wallis, Gilbert and Partners (1938) \n File:Ancien Institut national de Radiodiffusion - vue d'ensemble.JPG|[[Le Flagey|Former Belgian National Institute of Radio Broadcasting]] in [[Ixelles]] ([[Brussels]]), Belgium (1938) \n File:World Fair 1939 LOC gsc.5a03061.jpg|The Ford Pavilion at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] \n File:First Church of Deliverance 2.jpg|Streamline Moderne church, [[First Church of Deliverance]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], by [[Walter T.

Towers added in 1948. \n < /gallery > \n \n In the late 1930s, a new variety of Art Deco architecture became common; it was called [[Streamline Moderne]] or simply Streamline, or, in France, the Style Paqueboat, or Ocean Liner style. Buildings in the style had rounded corners and long horizontal lines; they were built of reinforced concrete, and were almost always white; and they sometimes had nautical features, such as railings that resembled those on a ship. The rounded corner was not entirely new; it had appeared in Berlin in 1923 in the [[Mossehaus]] by [[Erich Mendelsohn]], and later in the [[Hoover Building]], an industrial complex in the London suburb of [[Perivale]]. In the United States, it became most closely associated with transport; Streamline moderne was rare in office buildings, but was often used for bus stations and airport terminals, such as the terminal at La Guardia airport in New York City that handled the first transatlantic flights, via the PanAm Clipper flying boats; and in roadside architecture, such as gas stations and diners. In the late 1930s a series of diners, modeled after streamlined railroad cars, were produced and installed in towns in New England; at least two examples still remain and are now registered historic buildings.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=197}} \n \n ==Decoration and motifs== \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:Fire screen made by Rose Iron Works of Cleveland, 1930.JPG|Iron fireplace screen, Rose Iron Works ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]) (1930) \n File:Elevator doors of Chrysler Building (1927-30).jpg|Elevator doors of the [[Chrysler Building]] ([[New York City]], [[New York (state)|N.Y.]]), by [[William Van Alen]] (1927\u201330) \n File:MilwaukeeGasLightBuilding architecturaldetails.jpg|Sunrise motif from the [[Wisconsin Gas Building]] ([[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]) (1930) \n File:Oakland Paramount facade mosaic detail 2.jpg|Detail of mosaic facade of [[Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California)]] (1931) \n < /gallery > \n \n Decoration in the Art Deco period went through several distinct phases. Between 1910 and 1920, as Art Nouveau was exhausted, design styles saw a return to tradition, particularly in the work of Paul Iribe. In 1912 Andr\u00e9 Vera published an essay in the magazine ''L'Art D\u00e9coratif'' calling for a return to the craftsmanship and materials of earlier centuries, and using a new repertoire of forms taken from nature, particularly baskets and garlands of fruit and flowers. A second tendency of Art Deco, also from 1910 to 1920, was inspired by the bright colors of the artistic movement known as the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] and by the colorful costumes and sets of the Ballets Russes. This style was often expressed with exotic materials such as sharkskin, mother of pearl, ivory, tinted leather, lacquered and painted wood, and decorative inlays on furniture that emphasized its geometry. This period of the style reached its high point in the 1925 Paris Exposition of Decorative Arts. In the late 1920s and the 1930s, the decorative style changed, inspired by new materials and technologies. It became sleeker and less ornamental. Furniture, like architecture, began to have rounded edges and to take on a polished, streamlined look, taken from the streamline modern style. New materials, such as chrome-plated steel, aluminum and [[bakelite]], an early form of plastic, began to appear in furniture and decoration. < ref > Explanatory text on Art Deco in the Museum of Decorative Arts, Paris < /ref > \n \n Throughout the Art Deco period, and particularly in the 1930s, the motifs of the decor expressed the function of the building. Theaters were decorated with sculpture which illustrated music, dance, and excitement; power companies showed sunrises, the Chrysler building showed stylized hood ornaments; The friezes of Palais de la Porte Dor\u00e9e at the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition showed the faces of the different nationalities of French colonies. The Streamline style made it appear that the building itself was in motion. The WPA murals of the 1930s featured ordinary people; factory workers, postal workers, families and farmers, in place of classical heroes.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=250}} \n \n ==Furniture== \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:Paul follot, sedia, parigi 1914-16 ca.JPG|Chair by [[Paul Follot]] (1912\u201314) \n File:Art Deco chair and screen (1912 and 1920).jpg|Armchair by [[Louis S\u00fce]] (1912) and painted screen by [[Andr\u00e9 Mare]] (1920) \n File:Art Deco dressing table (1919-20).jpg|Dressing table and chair of marble and encrusted, lacquered, and gilded wood by Follot (1919\u201320) \n File:Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann (French, 1879-1933).

French furniture manufacturers felt threatened by the growing popularity of German manufacturers and styles, particularly the [[Biedermeier]] style, which was simple and clean-lined. The French designer Frantz Jourdain, the President of the Paris Salon d'Automne, invited designers from Munich to participate in the 1910 Salon. French designers saw the new German style, and decided to meet the German challenge. The French designers decided to present new French styles in the Salon of 1912. The rules of the Salon indicated that only modern styles would be permitted. All of the major French furniture designers took part in Salon: Paul Follot, Paul Iribe, Maurice Dufr\u00eane, Andr\u00e9 Groult, Andr\u00e9 Mare and Louis Su\u00eb took part, presenting new works that updated the traditional French styles of Louis XVI and [[Louis Philippe]] with more angular corners inspired by Cubism and brighter colors inspired by Fauvism and the Nabis.{{Sfn|Benton|2002|pages=91\u201393}} \n \n The painter [[Andr\u00e9 Mare]] and furniture designer [[Louis S\u00fce]] both participated the 1912 Salon. After the war the two men joined together to form their own company, formally called the ''Compagnie des Arts Fran\u00e7aise'', but usually known simply as Su\u00eb and Mare. Unlike the prominent art nouveau designers like Louis Majorelle, who personally designed every piece, they assembled a team of skilled craftsmen and produced complete interior designs, including furniture, glassware, carpets, ceramics, wallpaper and lighting. Their work featured bright colors and furniture and fine woods, such as ebony encrusted with mother of pearl, abalone and silvered metal to create bouquets of flowers. They designed everything from the interiors of ocean liners to perfume bottles for the label of [[Jean Patou]].The firm prospered in the early 1920s, but the two men were better craftsmen than businessmen. The firm was sold in 1928, and both men left.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=51}} \n \n The most prominent furniture designer at the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition was [[\u00c9mile-Jacques Ruhlmann]], from Alsace. He first exhibited his works at the 1913 Autumn Salon, then had his own pavilion, the  \" House of the Rich Collector \" , at the 1925 Exposition. He used only most rare and expensive materials, including [[ebony]], [[mahogany]], [[rosewood]], [[Ambon Island|ambon]] and other exotic woods, decorated with inlays of ivory, tortoise shell, mother of pearl, Little pompoms of silk decorated the handles of drawers of the cabinets.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=15}} His furniture was based upon 18th-century models, but simplified and reshaped. In all of his work, the interior structure of the furniture was completely concealed. The framework usually of oak, was completely covered with an overlay of thin strips of wood, then covered by a second layer of strips of rare and expensive woods. This was then covered with a veneer and polished, so that the piece looked as if it had been cut out of a single block of wood. Contrast to the dark wood was provided by inlays of ivory, and ivory key plates and handles. According to Ruhlmann, armchairs had to be designed differently according to the functions of the rooms where they appeared; living room armchairs were designed to be welcoming, office chairs comfortable, and salon chairs voluptuous. Only a small number of pieces of each design of furniture was made, and the average price of one of his beds or cabinets was greater than the price of an average house.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=56}} \n \n [[Jules Leleu]] was a traditional furniture designer who moved smoothly into Art Deco in the 1920s; he designed the furniture for the dining room of the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]], and for the first-class cabins of the steamship ''Normandie''. his style was characterized by the use of ebony, Macassar wood, walnut, with decoration of plaques of ivory and mother of pearl. He introduced the style of lacquered art deco furniture in the late 1920s, and in the late 1930s introduced furniture made of metal with panels of smoked glass.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=18\u201319}} In Italy, the designer [[Gio Ponti]] was famous for his streamlined designs. \n \n The costly and exotic furniture of Ruhlmann and other traditionalists infuriated modernists, including the architect Le Corbusier, causing him to write a famous series of articles denouncing the ''arts d\u00e9coratif'' style. He attacked furniture made only for the rich, and called upon designers to create furniture made with inexpensive materials and modern style, which ordinary people could afford. He designed his own chairs, created to be inexpensive and mass-produced. < ref > Alexandra Griffith Winton, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/dsgn2/hd_dsgn2.htm ''Design, 1925\u201350'']. Metropolitan Museum of Art, Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, October 2008 < /ref > \n \n In the 1930s, furniture designs adapted to the form, with smoother surfaces and curved forms. The masters of the late style included Donald Deskey was one of the most influential designers; he created the interior of the Radio City Music Hall. He used a mixture of traditional and very modern materials, including aluminum, chrome, and bakelite, an early form of plastic.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=36}} The [[Waterfall style]] was popular in the 1930s and 1940s, the most prevalent Art Deco form of furniture at the time.

It was influenced by modern [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] principles developed for aviation and [[ballistics]] to reduce aerodynamic drag at high velocities. The bullet shapes were applied by designers to cars, trains, ships, and even objects not intended to move, such as [[refrigerator]]s, [[Fuel dispenser|gas pumps]], and buildings. < ref name= \" Design: A Concise History \"  / >  One of the first production vehicles in this style was the [[Chrysler Airflow]] of 1933. It was unsuccessful commercially, but the beauty and functionality of its design set a precedent; meant modernity. It continued to be used in car design well after World War II. < ref > {{cite book |last=Gartman |first=David |title=Auto Opium |publisher=Routledge |year=1994 |pages=122\u2013124 | isbn=978-0-415-10572-9}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web| url=http://www.phxart.org/exhibition/exhibitioncurves.aspx |title=Curves of Steel: Streamlined Automobile Design |publisher=Phoenix Art Museum |year=2007 | access-date=1 September 2010}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book |last=Armi |first=C.

These included [[aluminum]], [[chrome plating|chrome]], and [[bakelite]], an early form of plastic. Bakelite could be easily molded into different forms, and soon was used in telephones, radios and other appliances. \n \n Ocean liners also adopted a style of Art Deco, known in French as the ''Style Paquebot'', or  \" Ocean Liner Style \" . The most famous example was the SS ''Normandie'', which made its first transatlantic trip in 1935. It was designed particularly to bring wealthy Americans to Paris to shop. The cabins and salons featured the latest Art Deco furnishings and decoration. The Grand Salon of the ship, which was the restaurant for first-class passengers, was bigger than the Hall of Mirrors of the [[Palace of Versailles]]. It was illuminated by electric lights within twelve pillars of Lalique crystal; thirty-six matching pillars lined the walls. This was one of the earliest examples of illumination being directly integrated into architecture. The style of ships was soon adapted to buildings. A notable example is found on the San Francisco waterfront, where the Maritime Museum building, built as a public bath in 1937, resembles a ferryboat, with ship railings and rounded corners. The Star Ferry Terminal in Hong Kong also used a variation of the style. < ref name= \" Goss \"  / > \n \n ==Textiles and fashion== \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File: \" Abundance \"  Textile MET DP293540.jpg|Textile design ''Abundance'' by [[Andr\u00e9 Mare]], (1911) ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]], USA) \n File: \" Draperies \"  Textile MET DP293587.jpg|Rose Pattern Textiles designed by Mare ({{circa|1919}}) (Metropolitan Museum of Art) \n File:Rose Mousse MET DP105936.jpg|Rose Mousse pattern for upholstery, cotton and silk (1920) (Metropolitan Museum of Art) \n File:Paul Iribe, birds from Les Ateliers de Martine.jpg|Design of birds from Les Ateliers de Martine by [[Paul Iribe]] (1918) \n < /gallery > \n Textiles were an important part of the Art Deco style, in the form of colorful wallpaper, upholstery and carpets, In the 1920s, designers were inspired by the stage sets of the [[Ballets Russes]], fabric designs and costumes from [[L\u00e9on Bakst]] and creations by the [[Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte]]. The early interior designs of [[Andr\u00e9 Mare]] featured brightly colored and highly stylized garlands of roses and flowers, which decorated the walls, floors, and furniture. Stylized Floral motifs also dominated the work of [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Paul Poiret]], and in the furniture designs of J.E. Ruhlmann. The floral carpet was reinvented in Deco style by [[Paul Poiret]]. < ref > De Morant, Henry, ''Histoire des arts d\u00e9coratifs'' (1970), pg. 448-453 < /ref > \n \n The use of the style was greatly enhanced by the introduction of the ''pochoir'' stencil-based printing system, which allowed designers to achieve crispness of lines and very vivid colors. Art Deco forms appeared in the clothing of [[Paul Poiret]], [[Charles Worth]] and [[Jean Patou]]. After World War I, exports of clothing and fabrics became one of the most important currency earners of France. < ref name= \" Beltra, Rubio 2016 \" > Beltra, Rubio, ''Exploring Art Deco in Textile and Fashion Design'', 20 December 2016, Site of [[Metropolitan Museum]] < /ref > \n \n Late Art Deco wallpaper and textiles sometimes featured stylized industrial scenes, cityscapes, locomotives and other modern themes, as well as stylized female figures, metallic colors and geometric designs. < ref name= \" Beltra, Rubio 2016 \" / > \n \n Fashion changed dramatically during the Art Deco period, thanks in particular to designers [[Paul Poiret]] and later [[Coco Chanel]].

They also placed greater emphasis on very elaborate and elegant settings, featuring less-expensive materials such as enamel, glass, horn and ivory. Diamonds themselves were cut in less traditional forms; the 1925 Exposition saw many diamonds cut in the form of tiny rods or matchsticks. The settings for diamonds also changed; More and more often jewelers used [[platinum]] instead of gold, since it was strong and flexible, and could set clusters of stones. Jewelers also began to use more dark materials, such as enamels and black [[onyx]], which provided a higher contrast with diamonds.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=121\u2013123}} \n \n Jewelry became much more colorful and varied in style. Cartier and the firm of Boucheron combined diamonds with colorful other gemstones cut into the form of leaves, fruit or flowers, to make brooches, rings, earrings, clips and pendants. Far Eastern themes also became popular; plaques of jade and coral were combined with platinum and diamonds, and vanity cases, cigarette cases and powder boxes were decorated with Japanese and Chinese landscapes made with mother of pearl, enamel and lacquer.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=121\u2013123}} \n \n Rapidly changing fashions in clothing brought new styles of jewelry. Sleeveless dresses of the 1920s meant that arms needed decoration, and designers quickly created bracelets of gold, silver and platinum encrusted with lapis-lazuli, onyx, coral, and other colorful stones; Other bracelets were intended for the upper arms, and several bracelets were often worn at the same time. The short haircuts of women in the twenties called for elaborate deco earring designs. As women began to smoke in public, designers created very ornate cigarette cases and ivory cigarette holders. The invention of the wrist-watch before World War I inspired jewelers to create extraordinary decorated watches, encrusted with diamonds and plated with enamel, gold and silver. Pendant watches, hanging from a ribbon, also became fashionable.{{sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=125}} \n \n The established jewelry houses of Paris in the period, Cartier, [[Chaumet]], Georges Fouquet, [[Mauboussin]], and [[Van Cleef  &  Arpels]] all created jewelry and objects in the new fashion. The firm of Chaumet made highly geometric cigarette boxes, cigarette lighters, pillboxes and notebooks, made of hard stones decorated with [[jade]], [[lapis lazuli]], diamonds and sapphires. They were joined by many young new designers, each with his own idea of deco. [[Raymond Templier]] designed pieces with highly intricate geometric patterns, including silver earrings that looked like skyscrapers. [[Gerard Sandoz]] was only 18 when he started to design jewelry in 1921; he designed many celebrated pieces based on the smooth and polished look of modern machinery. The glass designer Ren\u00e9 Lalique also entered the field, creating pendants of fruit, flowers, frogs, fairies or mermaids made of sculpted glass in bright colors, hanging on cords of silk with tassels.{{sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=125}} The jeweler [[Paul Brandt]] contrasted rectangular and triangular patterns, and embedded pearls in lines on onyx plaques. [[Jean Despres]] made necklaces of contrasting colors by bringing together silver and black lacquer, or gold with lapis lazuli. Many of his designs looked like highly polished pieces of machines. [[Jean Dunand]] was also inspired by modern machinery, combined with bright reds and blacks contrasting with polished metal.{{sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=125}} \n \n ==Glass art== \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:'Oiseau de Feu' made by Ren\u00e9 Lalique, Dayton Art Institute.JPG|''The Firebird'' by [[Ren\u00e9 Lalique]] (1922) \n File:Vase (Perruches) by Ren\u00e9 Jules Lalique, 1922, blown four mold glass - Cincinnati Art Museum - DSC04355.JPG|''Parrot'' vase by Lalique (1922) \n File:Victoire 2 by Rene Lalique Toyota Automobile Museum.jpg|Hood ornament ''Victoire'' by Lalique (1928) \n File:Vase aux raisins.jpg|A [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] vase with sculpted grapes (1925) \n File:Vitraux Louis Majorelle, Grands Bureaux des Aci\u00e9ries de Longwy 03.jpg|Window for a steel mill office by Louis Majorelle (1928) \n File:Arnaldo Dell'Ira (1903-1943), lampada a grattacielo, 1929.jpg|''Skyscraper Lamp'' designed by [[Arnaldo dell'Ira]] (1929) \n File:Vase des ann\u00e9es 30 (mus\u00e9e des arts d\u00e9coratifs) (4782889920).jpg|[[Daum (studio)|Daum]] vase (1930\u201335) \n File:Cathedral of Amiens glass window.jpg|Stained glass windows at [[Amiens Cathedral]] by [[Jean Gaudin (glass artist)|Jean Gaudin]] (1932\u201334) \n < /gallery > \n \n Like the Art Nouveau period before it, Art Deco was an exceptional period for fine glass and other decorative objects, designed to fit their architectural surroundings. The most famous producer of glass objects was Ren\u00e9 Lalique, whose works, from vases to hood ornaments for automobiles, became symbols of the period. He had made ventures into glass before World War I, designing bottles for the perfumes of [[Fran\u00e7ois Coty]], but he did not begin serious production of art glass until after World War I. In 1918, at the age of 58, he bought a large glass works in Combs-la-Ville and began to manufacture both artistic and practical glass objects. He treated glass as a form of sculpture, and created statuettes, vases, bowls, lamps and ornaments. He used demi-crystal rather than lead crystal, which was softer and easier to form, though not as lustrous. He sometimes used colored glass, but more often used opalescent glass, where part or the whole of the outer surface was stained with a wash. Lalique provided the decorative glass panels, lights and illuminated glass ceilings for the ocean liners {{SS|\u00cele de France}} in 1927 and the SS ''Normandie'' in 1935, and for some of the first-class sleeping cars of the French railroads. At the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts, he had his own pavilion, designed a dining room with a table setting and matching glass ceiling for the S\u00e8vres Pavilion, and designed a glass fountain for the courtyard of the Cours des M\u00e9tier, a slender glass column which spouted water from the sides and was illuminated at night.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245\u2013250}} \n \n Other notable Art Deco glass manufacturers included Marius-Ernest Sabino, who specialized in figurines, vases, bowls, and glass sculptures of fish, nudes, and animals. For these he often used an opalescent glass which could change from white to blue to amber, depending upon the light. His vases and bowls featured molded friezes of animals, nudes or busts of women with fruit or flowers. His work was less subtle but more colorful than that of Lalique.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245\u2013250}} \n \n Other notable Deco glass designers included Edmond Etling, who also used bright opalescent colors, often with geometric patterns and sculpted nudes; Albert Simonet, and Aristide Colotte and [[Maurice Marinot]], who was known for his deeply etched sculptural bottles and vases. The firm of [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] from the city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], which had been famous for its Art Nouveau glass, produced a line of Deco vases and glass sculpture, solid, geometric and chunky in form. More delicate multicolored works were made by [[Gabriel Argy-Rousseau]], who produced delicately colored vases with sculpted butterflies and nymphs, and Francois Decorchemont, whose vases were streaked and marbled.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245\u2013250}} \n \n The Great Depression ruined a large part of the decorative glass industry, which depended upon wealthy clients. Some artists turned to designing stained glass windows for churches. In 1937, the [[Steuben Glass Works|Steuben]] glass company began the practice of commissioning famous artists to produce glassware.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245\u2013250}} [[Louis Majorelle]], famous for his Art Nouveau furniture, designed a remarkable Art Deco stained glass window portraying steel workers for the offices of the [[Aci\u00e9ries de Longwy]], a steel mill in [[Longwy]], France. \n \n [[Amiens Cathedral]] has a rare example of Art Deco stained glass windows in the Chapel of the Sacred Heart, made in 1932-34 by the Paris glass artist [[Jean Gaudin (glass artist)|Jean Gaudin]] based on drawings by Jacques Le Breton.{{Sfn|Plagnieux|2003|p=82}} \n \n ==Metal art== \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 200px \" > \n File:Art Deco fireplace grill.jpg|A grill with two wings called ''The Pheasants'', made by Paul Kiss and displayed at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative and Industrial Arts \n File:Art Deco screen  \" Oasis \"  1925.jpg|Iron and copper grill called ''Oasis'' by Edgar Brandt, displayed at the 1925 Paris Exposition \n Spiegel_mit_Frauenkopf_von_Franz_Hagenauer,_um_1930.tif|Table mirror by Franz Hagenauer of [[Werkst\u00e4tte Hagenauer Wien]] ({{circa|1930}}) \n File:Norman Bel Geddes.

The American artist [[Norman Bel Geddes]] designed a cocktail set resembling a skyscraper made of chrome-plated steel. Raymond Subes designed an elegant metal grille for the entrance of the Palais de la Porte Dor\u00e9e, the centerpiece of the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition.

Also in West London is the Hoover Building, which was originally built for [[The Hoover Company]] and was converted into a superstore in the early 1990s. \n \n '''Bucharest, Romania''' \n Bucharest once known as the  \" Little Paris \"  of the 19th century engages in a new adventure after the first world war, together with the new trends and progress of technology, thus redirecting its inspiration towards a further horizon, New York City. The 1930s bring a new fashion brought by a newer generation which echoes in the cinema, theater, dancing styles, art and architecture. Bucharest during the 1930s was marked by more and more art deco architecture from the bigger boulevards like Magheru street to the private houses and smaller neighborhoods.  \n One of the first landmarks of modern Bucharest is considered The Palace of Telephones which would be the first skyscraper of the city. It was the tallest building between 1933 and the 1970s, with a height of 52.5 & nbsp;m. The architects were Louis Weeks and Edmond Van Saanen and engineer Walter Troy. \n The art deco monuments are a crucial part of the entire character of Bucharest since they describe and mark an important period from history, the interbellic life (WW1-WW2). Unfortunately, most of the buildings from those years are prone to catastrophes, Bucharest being in danger of another earthquake, very common for its geographic region. It is truly important to protect the art deco patrimony in Bucharest and preserve another great and essential art deco capital from Europe. \n < ref > https://artdecobucharest.ro/ < /ref > \n \n ===India=== \n {{See also|Art Deco in Mumbai}} \n The Indian Institute of Architects, founded in Mumbai in 1929, played a prominent role in propagating the Art Deco movement. In November 1937, this institute organized the 'Ideal Home Exhibition' held in the Town Hall in Mumbai which spanned over 12 days and attracted about one hundred thousand visitors. As a result, it was declared a success by the 'Journal of the Indian Institute of Architects'. The exhibits displayed the 'ideal', or better described as the most 'modern' arrangements for various parts of the house, paying close detail to avoid architectural blunders and present the most efficient and well-thought-out models. The exhibition focused on various elements of a home ranging from furniture, elements of interior decoration as well as radios and refrigerators using new and scientifically relevant materials and methods. < ref name= \" :0 \" > {{Cite book|title=Mumbai Fables|last=Prakash|first=Gyan|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780691142845|page=99}} < /ref > \n Guided by their desire to emulate the west, the Indian architects were fascinated by the industrial modernity that Art Deco offered. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >  The western elites were the first to experiment with the technologically advanced facets of Art Deco, and architects began the process of transformation by the early 1930s. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / > \n \n Mumbai's expanding port commerce in the 1930s resulted in the growth of educated middle class population. It also saw an increase of people migrating to Mumbai in search of job opportunities. This led to the pressing need for new developments through Land Reclamation Schemes and construction of new public and residential buildings. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Bombay : the cities within|last=Sharada.|first=Dwivedi|date=1995|publisher=India Book House|others=Mehrotra, Rahul., Mulla-Feroze, Umaima.|isbn=818502880X|location=Mumbai|oclc=33153751}} < /ref >  Parallelly, the changing political climate in the country and the aspirational quality of the Art Deco aesthetics led to a whole-hearted acceptance of the building style in the city's development.

Even more modest art deco buildings have been preserved as part of America's architectural heritage; an art deco cafe and gas station along Route 66 in Shamrock, Texas is an historic monument. The Miami Beach Architectural District protects several hundred old buildings, and requires that new buildings comply with the style. In [[Havana]], Cuba, many Art Deco buildings have badly deteriorated. Efforts are underway to bring the buildings back to their original color and appearance. \n \n In the 21st century, modern variants of Art Deco, called Neo Art Deco (or Neo-Art Deco), have appeared in some American cities, inspired by the classic Art Deco buildings of the 1920s and 1930s. < ref name= \" Capitman \" > [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0525934421 Barbara B.
