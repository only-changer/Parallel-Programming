London: [[George Newnes Ltd|George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. & nbsp;1, p. & nbsp;497. < /ref >  but the derivation of this name is uncertain. The traditional etymology is from the verb ''aperire'',  \" to open \" , in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to  \" open \" , which is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of [[wikt:\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7#Greek|\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7]] (''\u00e1nixi'') (opening) for spring. Since some of the Roman months were named in honor of divinities, and as April was sacred to the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], her [[Veneralia]] being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month '''Aphrilis''', from her equivalent Greek goddess name [[Aphrodite]] (''Aphros''), or from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name ''[[Aphrodite|Apru]]''. [[Jacob Grimm]] suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, ''Aper'' or ''Aprus''. < ref > Jacob Grim ''Geschichte der deutschen Sprache''. Cap.  \" Monate \" < /ref > \n \n April was the second month of the earliest [[Roman calendar]], < ref name= \" Chisholm1911 \" / >  before ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' were added by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700 & nbsp;BC. It became the fourth month of the calendar year (the year when twelve months are displayed in order) during the time of the [[decemvirs]] about 450 & nbsp;BC, when it also was given 29 & nbsp;days. The 30th day was added during the reform of the calendar undertaken by [[Julius Caesar]] in the mid-40s & nbsp;BC, which produced the Julian calendar. \n \n The [[Anglo-Saxons]] called April ''\u0113astre-mona\u00fe''. The [[Venerable Bede]] says in ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' that this month ''\u0113astre'' is the root of the word [[Easter]]. He further states that the month was named after a goddess ''[[Eostre]]'' whose feast was in that month. It is also attested by [[Einhard]] in his work, [[Vita Karoli Magni]]. \n \n [[St George]]'s day is the twenty-third of the month; and [[St Mark]]'s Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth. < ref name= \" Chisholm1911 \" > {{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=April|volume=2|page=230}} < /ref > \n \n In [[History of China|China]] the symbolic ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood took place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to April. < ref name= \" Chisholm1911 \" / >  In Finnish April is ''huhtikuu'', meaning ''[[slash-and-burn]] moon'', when [[gymnosperm]]s for beat and burn clearing of farmland were felled. \n \n In [[Slovene language|Slovene]], the most established traditional name is ''mali traven'', meaning the month when plants start growing. It was first written in 1466 in the [[\u0160kofja Loka manuscript]]. < ref name= \" KoledarDPG2007 \" > {{cite journal|url=http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |title=Koledar prireditev v letu 2007 in druge informacije ob\u010dine Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec |language=sl |trans-title=The Calendar of Events and Other Information of the Municipality of Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec  < !-- |issn=C505-5857 -- >  |publisher=Municipality of Dobrova-Polhov Gradec |year=2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102060918/http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |archive-date=November 2, 2013 }} < /ref > \n \n The month Aprilis had 30 & nbsp;days; [[Numa Pompilius]] made it 29 & nbsp;days long; finally [[Julius Caesar]]\u2019s calendar reform made it again 30 & nbsp;days long, which was not changed in the calendar revision of [[Julian calendar|Augustus Caesar]] in 8 & nbsp;BC. Additionally in the Spanish colony, Las Islas Filipinas (now known as the Philippines), the month Aprilis had a significant meaning to the life of the natives as it was associated to the influence of the Chinese during the Spanish colonial period. The importance of this aspect to the lives of the natives was formerly associated to an event called  \" Abril na Ikaw \"  as it is closely linked to the famous trader, April Yu. \n \n In [[Ancient Rome]], the festival of [[Cerealia]] was held for seven days from mid-to-late April, but exact dates are uncertain. [[Feriae Latinae]] was also held in April, with the date varying. Other ancient Roman observances include [[Veneralia]] (April 1), [[Megalesia]] (April 10\u201316), [[Fordicidia]] (April 15), [[Parilia]] (April 21), [[Vinalia|Vinalia Urbana]], [[Robigalia]], and [[Serapia]] were celebrated on (April 25). [[Floralia]] was held April 27 during the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], or April 28 on the [[Julian calendar]], and lasted until May 3. However, these dates do not correspond to the modern [[Gregorian calendar]]. \n \n The [[Lyrids]] [[meteor shower]] appears on April 16 \u2013 April 26 each year, with the peak generally occurring on April 22. [[Eta Aquariids]] meteor shower also appears in April. It is visible from about April 21 to about May 20 each year with peak activity on or around May 6. The [[Pi Puppids]] appear on April 23, but only in years around the parent comet's [[perihelion]] date. The [[Virginids]] also shower at various dates in April. \n \n The  \" Days of April \"  (''journ\u00e9es d'avril'') is a name appropriated in French history to a [[July Monarchy#April 1834 insurrections|series of insurrections]] at Lyons, Paris and elsewhere, against the government of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] in 1834, which led to violent repressive measures, and to a famous trial known as the ''proc\u00e8s d'avril''. < ref name= \" Chisholm1911 \" / > \n \n ==April symbols== \n [[File:Diamond.jpg|alt=Faceted diamond|thumb|Faceted diamond]]April's [[Birthstones|birthstone]] is the [[diamond (gemstone)|diamond]]. \n *[[File:Daisy ntgr.JPG|alt=Daisy flower|thumb|[[Bellis perennis|Daisy]] flower]][[File:Sweet Pea (27711557850).jpg|alt=Sweet pea|thumb|[[Sweet pea]]]]The [[birth flower]] is typically listed as either the [[Common Daisy|Daisy]] ''(Bellis perennis)'' or the [[Sweet pea|Sweet Pea]]. < ref > Kipfer, Barbara Ann (1997) ''The Order of Things.''
