(ed.), ''Vertebrate Paleontology in Utah''. Utah Geological Survey Miscellaneous Publication 99-1. < /ref > ). The name  \" ''Allosaurus'' \"  means  \" different lizard \"  alluding to its unique (at the time of its discovery) concave [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#vertebrae|vertebrae]]. It is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|allos}}'') ( \" different, other \" ) and {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|sauros}}'') ( \" lizard / generic reptile \" ). The first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by [[paleontologist]] [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]. As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs, it has long attracted attention outside of paleontological circles. \n ''Allosaurus'' was a large [[biped]]al [[predation|predator]]. Its skull was light, robust and equipped with dozens of sharp, [[serrated]] teeth. It averaged {{convert|10|m|sp=us}} in length, though fragmentary remains suggest it could have reached over {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, its three-fingered forelimbs were small, and the body was balanced by a long and heavily muscled tail. It is classified as an [[allosaurid]], a type of [[carnosauria]]n theropod dinosaur. The genus has a complicated [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and includes three valid [[species]], the best known of which is ''A. fragilis''. The bulk of ''Allosaurus'' remains have come from [[North America]]'s [[Morrison Formation]], with material also known from Portugal. It was known for over half of the 20th century as ''[[Antrodemus]]'', but a study of the copious remains from the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]] brought the name  \" ''Allosaurus'' \"  back to prominence and established it as one of the best-known dinosaurs. \n \n As the most abundant large predator in the Morrison Formation, ''Allosaurus'' was at the top of the [[food chain]], probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps other predators. Potential prey included [[ornithopod]]s, [[stegosaurid]]s, and [[sauropod]]s. Some paleontologists interpret ''Allosaurus'' as having had cooperative [[social behavior]], and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. \n \n ==Description== \n [[File:Allosaurus size comparison.svg|thumb|left|The size range of ''Allosaurus'' compared with a human]] \n ''Allosaurus'' was a typical large [[theropod]], having a massive [[skull]] on a short [[neck]], a long, slightly sloping [[tail]], and reduced forelimbs.

This strategy would also potentially have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon in a similar way later. < ref name=HMC04/ >  An additional suggestion notes that ornithopods were the most common available dinosaurian prey, and that allosaurs may have subdued them by using an attack similar to that of modern big cats: grasping the prey with their forelimbs, and then making multiple bites on the throat to crush the trachea. < ref name=JF07/ >  This is compatible with other evidence that the forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey. < ref name=KC02/ >  Studies done by Stephen Lautenschager ''et al.'' from the University of Bristol also indicate ''Allosaurus'' could open its jaws quite wide and sustain considerable muscle force. When compared with ''Tyrannosaurus'' and the therizinosaurid ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' in the same study, it was found that ''Allosaurus'' had a wider gape than either; the animal was capable of opening its jaws to a 92-degree angle at maximum.

This would have allowed the animal to make rapid and forceful vertical movements with the skull. The authors found that vertical strikes as proposed by Bakker and Rayfield are consistent with the animal's capabilities. They also found that the animal probably processed carcasses by vertical movements in a similar manner to [[falcon]]s, such as [[kestrel]]s: the animal could have gripped prey with the skull and feet, then pulled back and up to remove flesh.

The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator, as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs, is rare among [[vertebrate]]s in general, and modern [[diapsid]] carnivores (including lizards, crocodiles, and birds) rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way. Instead, they are typically territorial and will kill and [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalize]] intruders of the same species, and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites. According to this interpretation, the accumulation of remains of multiple ''Allosaurus'' individuals at the same site; e.g., in the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry|Cleveland\u2013Lloyd Quarry]], are not due to pack hunting, but to the fact that ''Allosaurus'' individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs, and were sometimes killed in the process. This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present, as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like [[crocodile]]s and [[Komodo dragon]]s. The same interpretation applies to Bakker's lair sites. < ref name=RB07 > {{cite journal|last1=Roach|first1=Brian T. |year=2007 |title=A reevaluation of cooperative pack hunting and gregariousness in ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'' and other nonavian theropod dinosaurs|journal=Bulletin of the Peabody Museum of Natural History |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=103\u2013138 |doi=10.3374/0079-032X(2007)48[103:AROCPH]2.0.CO;2|last2=Brinkman|first2=Daniel L.}} < /ref >  There is some evidence for cannibalism in ''Allosaurus'', including ''Allosaurus'' shed teeth found among rib fragments, possible tooth marks on a [[Scapula|shoulder blade]], < ref name=BGD04 > {{cite journal |last=Goodchild Drake |first=Brandon |year=2004 |title=A new specimen of ''Allosaurus'' from north-central Wyoming |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=24 |issue=3, Suppl |page=65A | doi = 10.1080/02724634.2004.10010643 |s2cid=220415208 }} < /ref >  and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at Bakker's lair sites. < ref name=BB04/ > \n \n ===Brain and senses=== \n [[File:Allo-endo.tif|thumb|left|upright|[[Endocast]] (cast of the brain cavity) of ''Allosaurus'']] \n The brain of ''Allosaurus'', as interpreted from spiral [[CT scan]]ning of an [[Endocranial cast|endocast]], was more consistent with [[crocodilia]]n brains than those of the other living [[archosaur]]s, birds. The structure of the [[Vestibular system|vestibular apparatus]] indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the [[inner ear]] was like that of a crocodilian, and so ''Allosaurus'' probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The [[olfactory bulb]]s were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small. < ref name=SWR99/ > \n \n ===Paleopathology=== \n [[File:Allosaurus fragilis USNM4734.jpg|thumb|Mounted ''A. fragilis'' skeleton (USNM4734), which has several healed injuries]] \n In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for [[stress fractures]] and [[tendon avulsions]] in [[theropod]] dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury. Stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or [[animal migration|migration]], resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand. ''Allosaurus'' was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion, and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb. When the researchers looked for stress fractures, they found that ''Allosaurus'' had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than ''[[Albertosaurus]]'', ''[[Ornithomimus]]'' or ''[[Archaeornithomimus]]''. Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied, three were found to contain stress fractures. Of the feet, 281 bones were studied and 17 were found to have stress fractures. The stress fractures in the foot bones  \" were distributed to the [[proximal]] [[phalanges]] \"  and occurred across all three weight-bearing toes in  \" statistically indistinguishable \"  numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running, it would have borne the most stress. If the allosaurs' stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others. The lack of such a bias in the examined ''Allosaurus'' fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey, like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in ''Allosaurus'' provide evidence for  \" very active \"  predation-based rather than scavenging diets. < ref name= \" rothschild-dino \" > Rothschild, B., Tanke, D.

The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs), and the fact that it was among the most massive in the skeleton, indicates that the ''Allosaurus'' was being scavenged. < ref name=CFJ98 > {{cite journal |last=Chure |first=Daniel J. |year=2000 |title=Prey bone utilization by predatory dinosaurs in the Late Jurassic of North America, with comments on prey bone use by dinosaurs throughout the Mesozoic |journal=Gaia |volume=15 |pages=227\u2013232 |issn=0871-5424| url=https://www.academia.edu/18277086}} < /ref > \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n \n ==External links== \n * [https://web.archive.org/web/20130929080234/http://archosaur.us/theropoddatabase/Carnosauria.htm#Allosaurusfragilis Specimens, discussion, and references pertaining to ''Allosaurus fragilis''] at The Theropod Database \n * [http://pioneer.utah.gov/research/utah_symbols/fossil.html Utah State Fossil, ''Allosaurus''], from Pioneer: Utah's Online Library \n * [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926062344/http://skeletaldrawing.com/psgallery/images/allosaurus.jpg Restoration of MOR 693 ( \" Big Al \" )] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20071007120836/http://www.skeletaldrawing.com/psgallery/pages/allosaurdeepmuscle.html muscle and organ restoration] at Scott Hartman's Skeletal Drawing website \n * [http://dml.cmnh.org/1995Nov/msg00278.html List of the many possible ''Allosaurus'' species...] \n *{{Commons category-inline|Allosaurus}} \n *{{Wikispecies-inline}} \n *{{Wikibooks-inline|Wikijunior:Dinosaurs/Allosaurus}} \n \n {{Theropoda|A.}} \n {{Taxonbar|from=Q14400}} \n {{Authority control}} \n \n {{Featured article}} \n \n [[Category:Allosaurids| ]] \n [[Category:Late Jurassic genus first appearances]] \n [[Category:Late Jurassic genus extinctions]] \n [[Category:Late Jurassic dinosaurs of Europe]] \n [[Category:Jurassic Portugal]] \n [[Category:Fossils of Portugal]] \n [[Category:Lourinh\u00e3 Formation]] \n [[Category:Late Jurassic dinosaurs of North America]] \n [[Category:Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation]] \n [[Category:Paleontology in Colorado]] \n [[Category:Paleontology in Wyoming]] \n [[Category:Paleontology in Utah]] \n [[Category:Fossil taxa described in 1877]] \n [[Category:Taxa named by Othniel Charles Marsh]] \n [[Category:Apex predators]]"
