He was born around 735 and became the student of [[Ecgbert (Archbishop of York)|Archbishop Ecgbert]] at York. At the invitation of [[Charlemagne]], he became a leading scholar and teacher at the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian court]], where he remained a figure in the 780s and 790s.  \" The most learned man anywhere to be found \" , according to [[Einhard]]'s ''[[Vita Karoli Magni|Life of Charlemagne]]'' < ref > Einhard, ''Life of Charlemagne'', \u00a725. < /ref >  (c. 817\u2013833), he is considered among the most important intellectual architects of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. Among his pupils were many of the dominant intellectuals of the Carolingian era. \n \n During this period, he perfected [[Carolingian minuscule]], an easily read manuscript hand using a mixture of upper- and lower-case letters. < ref name=Marcia > {{cite book|last1=Colish|first1=Marcia L.|title=Medieval Foundations of the Western Intellectual Tradition, 400\u20131400|series=The Yale Intellectual History of the West|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=1999|page=67|isbn = 9780300078527 }} < /ref >  Latin [[paleography]] in the eighth century leaves little room for a single origin of the script, and sources contradict his importance as  no proof has been found of his direct involvement in the creation of the script. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Dales |first1=Douglas |title=Alcuin II: Theology and Thought |date=2013 |publisher=ISD LLC |isbn=978-0-227-90087-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YNDYDwAAQBAJ & q=Carolingian+minuscule+alcuin & pg=PP143 |language=en}} < /ref >  Carolingian minuscule was already in use before Alcuin arrived in Francia. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Mckitterick |first1=Rosamond |title=The Frankish Kingdoms Under the Carolingians 751-987 |date=2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-87247-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_6rDwAAQBAJ & q=Carolingian+minuscule+alcuin & pg=PT167 |language=en}} < /ref >  Most likely he was responsible for copying and preserving the script < ref > {{cite book |last1=Bowen |first1=James |title=Hist West Educ:Civil Europe V2 |date=2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-50096-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHl0DwAAQBAJ & q=Carolingian+minuscule+alcuin & pg=PT35 |language=en}} < /ref >  while at the same time restoring the purity of the form. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Morison |first1=Stanley |title=Selected Essays Ont the History of Letter-forms in Manuscript and Print |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-18316-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-G2tQVnPiCAC & q=Carolingian+minuscule+alcuin & pg=PA255 |language=en}} < /ref > \n \n Alcuin wrote many theological and dogmatic treatises, as well as a few grammatical works and a number of poems. In 796, he was made abbot of [[Marmoutier Abbey, Tours|Marmoutier Abbey]], in [[Tours]], where he remained until his death. \n \n ==Biography== \n ===Background=== \n [[File:AT 13763 Roof figures at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna-8.jpg|thumb|upright|Alcuin, roof figure, Museum of History of Arts, Vienna.]] \n Alcuin was born in [[Northumbria]], presumably sometime in the 730s. Virtually nothing is known of his parents, family background, or origin.{{sfn|Bullough |2004|p= 164}} In common hagiographical fashion, the ''Vita Alcuini'' asserts that Alcuin was  \" of noble English stock \" , and this statement has usually been accepted by scholars. Alcuin's own work only mentions such collateral kinsmen as Wilgils, father of the missionary saint [[Willibrord]]; and [[Beornrad (archbishop of Sens)|Beornrad]] (also spelled Beornred), abbot of Echternach and bishop of Sens.{{sfn|Bullough |2004|pp= 146\u201347, 165}} Willibrord, Alcuin and Beornrad were all related by blood.{{sfn|Mayr-Harting|2016|page=212}}{{sfn|Stenton|2001|page=219}} \n \n In his ''Life'' of St Willibrord, Alcuin writes that Wilgils, called a ''paterfamilias'', had founded an oratory and church at the mouth of the [[Humber]], which had fallen into Alcuin's possession by inheritance. Because in early Anglo-Latin writing ''paterfamilias'' ( \" head of a family, householder \" ) usually referred to a {{lang|ang|[[churl|ceorl]]}} ( \" churl \" ), [[Donald A. Bullough]] suggests that Alcuin's family was of {{lang|ang|cierlisc}} ( \" churlish \" ) status: i.e., free but subordinate to a noble lord, and that Alcuin and other members of his family rose to prominence through beneficial connections with the aristocracy.{{sfn|Bullough |2004|pp= 146\u201347, 165}} If so, Alcuin's origins may lie in the southern part of what was formerly known as [[Deira]].{{sfn|Bullough |2004|p=165}} \n \n ===York=== \n The young Alcuin came to the [[York Minster|cathedral church]] of York during the golden age of Archbishop [[Ecgbert, Archbishop of York|Ecgbert]] and his brother, the Northumbrian King [[Eadberht of Northumbria|Eadberht]]. Ecgbert had been a disciple of the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]], who urged him to raise York to an [[archbishopric]]. King Eadberht and Archbishop Ecgbert oversaw the re-energising and reorganisation of the [[History of the Church of England|English church]], with an emphasis on reforming the clergy and on the tradition of learning that Bede had begun. Ecgbert was devoted to Alcuin, who thrived under his tutelage. \n \n The York school was renowned as a centre of learning in the liberal arts, literature, and science, as well as in religious matters.{{sfn|Hutchison|2006}} From here, Alcuin drew inspiration for the school he would lead at the [[Franks|Frankish]] court. He revived the school with the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] and [[quadrivium]] disciplines,{{sfn|Burns|1907}} writing a [[codex]] on the trivium, while his student [[Rabanus Maurus|Hraban]] wrote one on the quadrivium. \n \n Alcuin graduated to become a teacher during the 750s. His ascendancy to the headship of the York school, the ancestor of [[St Peter's School, York|St Peter's School]], began after [[Ethelbert of York|Aelbert]] became Archbishop of York in 767. Around the same time, Alcuin became a [[deacon]] in the church. He was never ordained a priest. Though no real evidence shows that he took monastic vows, he lived as if he had. \n \n In 781, King [[\u00c6lfwald I of Northumbria|Elfwald]] sent Alcuin to Rome to petition the pope for official confirmation of York's status as an archbishopric and to confirm the election of the new archbishop, [[Eanbald I]]. On his way home, he met Charlemagne (whom he had met once before), this time in the Italian city of [[Parma]].{{efn|{{harvnb|Mayr-Harting|2016|page=207}} asserts Charlemagne met Alcuin \u2013 for the second time \u2013 at Parma in 781. {{harvnb|Story|2005|p=137}} reports that Alcuin had previously been sent to Charlemagne by Ethelbert.}} \n \n ===Charlemagne=== \n {{Scholasticism}} \n Alcuin's intellectual curiosity allowed him to be reluctantly persuaded to join Charlemagne's court. He joined an illustrious group of scholars whom Charlemagne had gathered around him, the mainsprings of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]: [[Peter of Pisa]], [[Saint Paulinus II|Paulinus of Aquileia]], Rado, and [[Saint Fulrad|Abbot Fulrad]]. Alcuin would later write,  \" the Lord was calling me to the service of King Charles \" . \n \n Alcuin became master of the [[Charlemagne's Palace in Aachen|Palace]] School of Charlemagne in [[Aachen]] ({{lang|la|Urbs Regale}}) in 782.{{sfn|Burns|1907}} It had been founded by the king's ancestors as a place for the education of the royal children (mostly in manners and the ways of the court). However, Charlemagne wanted to include the [[liberal arts]], and most importantly, the study of religion. From 782 to 790, Alcuin taught Charlemagne himself, his sons [[Pepin the Hunchback|Pepin]] and [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], as well as young men sent to be educated at court, and the young clerics attached to the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|palace chapel]]. Bringing with him from York his assistants Pyttel, Sigewulf, and Joseph, Alcuin revolutionised the educational standards of the Palace School, introducing Charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning, to the extent that the institution came to be known as the 'school of Master Albinus'. \n \n In this role as adviser, he took issue with the emperor's policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death, arguing,  \" Faith is a free act of the will, not a forced act. We must appeal to the conscience, not compel it by violence. You can force people to be baptised, but you cannot force them to believe. \"  His arguments seem to have prevailed \u2013 Charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in 797.{{sfn|Needham|2000|p=52}} \n \n Charlemagne gathered the best men of every land in his court, and became far more than just the king at the centre. It seems that he made many of these men his closest friends and counsellors. They referred to him as 'David', a reference to the Biblical king [[David (biblical king)|David]]. Alcuin soon found himself on intimate terms with Charlemagne and the other men at court, where pupils and masters were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames.{{sfn|Wilmot-Buxton|1922|p=93}} Alcuin himself was known as 'Albinus' or 'Flaccus'. While at [[Aachen]], Alcuin bestowed pet names upon his pupils \u2013 derived mainly from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]''.{{sfn|Jaeger|1999|p=38}} According to the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'',  \" He loved Charlemagne and enjoyed the king's esteem, but his letters reveal that his fear of him was as great as his love. \" < ref name=EB/ > \n \n ===Return to Northumbria and back to Francia=== \n In 790, Alcuin returned from the court of Charlemagne to England, to which he had remained attached. He dwelt there for some time, but Charlemagne then invited him back to help in the fight against the [[Spanish Adoptionism|Adoptionist]] heresy, which was at that time making great progress in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the old capital of the [[Visigoths]] and still a major city for the Christians under [[Al-Andalus|Islamic rule in Spain]]. He is believed to have had contacts with [[Beatus of Li\u00e9bana]], from the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], who fought against Adoptionism. At the [[Council of Frankfurt]] in 794, Alcuin upheld the orthodox doctrine against the views expressed by [[Felix, Bishop of Urgel|Felix of Urgel]], an [[heresiarch]] according to the Catholic Encyclopaedia.{{sfn|Burns|1907}} Having failed during his stay in Northumbria to influence King [[\u00c6thelred I of Northumbria|\u00c6thelred]] in the conduct of his reign, Alcuin never returned home. \n \n He was back at Charlemagne's court by at least mid-792, writing a series of letters to \u00c6thelred, to Hygbald, Bishop of [[Lindisfarne]], and to [[\u00c6thelhard]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in the succeeding months, dealing with the [[Viking]] attack on Lindisfarne in July 793. These letters and Alcuin's poem on the subject, {{Lang|la| \" De clade Lindisfarnensis monasterii \" }}, provide the only significant contemporary account of these events. In his description of the Viking attack, he wrote:  \" Never before has such terror appeared in Britain. Behold the church of [[St Cuthbert]], splattered with the blood of God's priests, robbed of its ornaments. \" \n \n ===Tours and death=== \n {{Infobox saint \n |honorific_prefix = [[Saint]] \n |name=Alcuin of York \n |feast_day=20 May \n |venerated_in=[[Anglican Communion]], [[Roman Catholic Church]], as a blessed \n |image=Raban-Maur Alcuin Otgar.jpg \n |imagesize= \n |titles= Deacon, Scholar, Abbot of Tours \n |beatified_date= \n |beatified_place= \n |beatified_by= \n |canonized_date= \n |canonized_place= \n |canonized_by= \n |attributes= \n |patronage= \n |major_shrine= \n |suppressed_date= \n }} \n In 796, Alcuin was in his 60s. He hoped to be free from court duties and upon the death of Abbot Itherius of Saint Martin at Tours, Charlemagne put [[Marmoutier Abbey, Tours|Marmoutier Abbey]] into Alcuin's care, with the understanding that he should be available if the king ever needed his counsel. There, he encouraged the work of the monks on the beautiful Carolingian minuscule script, ancestor of modern Roman typefaces. < ref name=EB > {{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alcuin|title=Alcuin  & #124; Anglo-Saxon scholar|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}} < /ref > \n \n Alcuin died on 19 May 804, some 10 years before the emperor, and was buried at St. Martin's Church under an epitaph that partly read:{{sfn|Duckett|1951|p=305}} \n {{poemquote|Dust, worms, and ashes now & nbsp;... \n Alcuin my name, wisdom I always loved, \n Pray, reader, for my soul.}} \n \n The majority of details on Alcuin's life come from his letters and poems. Also, autobiographical sections are in Alcuin's poem on York and in the ''Vita Alcuini'', a [[hagiography]] written for him at Ferri\u00e8res in the 820s, possibly based in part on the memories of Sigwulf, one of Alcuin's pupils. \n \n ==Carolingian Renaissance figure and legacy== \n ===Mathematician=== \n {{Main|Propositiones ad acuendos juvenes}} \n The collection of mathematical and logical word problems entitled ''Propositiones ad acuendos juvenes'' ( \" Problems to Sharpen Youths \" ){{sfn|Alcuin|n.d.}} is sometimes attributed to Alcuin. < ref name= \" Peterson-2005 \" > {{Cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_11_21_05.html|title=Ivars Peterson's MathTrek Nov 21, 2005}} < /ref > {{sfn|Atkinson|2005|pp=354\u201362}} In a 799 letter to Charlemagne, the scholar claimed to have sent  \" certain figures of arithmetic for the joy of cleverness \" , < ref > ''Epistola'' 172, MGH ''Epistolae'' 4.2: 285:  \" aliquas figuras arithmeticae subtilitatis laetitiae causa \" < /ref >  which some scholars have identified with the ''Propositiones.''{{sfn|Jullien|Perelman|1994|p=482\u201383}} \n {{efn|A more skeptical attitude toward Alcuin's authorship of this text and others is taken by {{harvnb|Gorman|2002|pp=101\u201330}} }} \n The text contains about 53 mathematical word problems (with solutions), in no particular pedagogical order. Among the most famous of these problems are: four that involve [[river crossing problem|river crossings]], including the [[Jealous husbands problem|problem of three anxious brothers]], each of whom has an unmarried sister whom he cannot leave alone with either of the other men lest she be defiled < ref name= \" 3-brothers \" > {{Cite web|url=http://logica.ugent.be/albrecht/alcuin.pdf|title=Latin title and English text of the problem}} < /ref >  (Problem 17); the [[Fox, goose and bag of beans puzzle|problem of the wolf, goat, and cabbage]] (Problem 18); and the problem of  \" the two adults and two children where the children weigh half as much as the adults \"  (Problem 19). [[Alcuin's sequence]] is the solution to one of the problems of that book. \n \n ===Literary influence=== \n Alcuin made the abbey school into a model of excellence and many students flocked to it. He had many manuscripts copied using outstandingly beautiful [[calligraphy]], the Carolingian minuscule based on round and legible [[uncial]] letters. He wrote many letters to his English friends, to [[Arno of Salzburg|Arno, bishop of Salzburg]] and above all to Charlemagne. These letters (of which 311 are extant) are filled mainly with pious meditations, but they form an important source of information as to the literary and social conditions of the time and are the most reliable authority for the history of [[humanism]] during the [[Carolingian]] age. Alcuin trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety, and in the midst of these pursuits, he died. \n \n Alcuin is the most prominent figure of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], in which three main periods have been distinguished: in the first of these, up to the arrival of Alcuin at the court, the Italians occupy a central place; in the second, Alcuin and the [[Anglo-Saxons]] are dominant; in the third (from 804), the influence of [[Theodulf of Orl\u00e9ans|Theodulf the Visigoth]] is preponderant. \n \n Alcuin also developed manuals used in his educational work \u2013 a [[grammar]] and works on [[rhetoric]] and [[dialectics]]. These are written in the form of [[dialogues]], and in two of them the interlocutors are Charlemagne and Alcuin. He wrote several [[theological]] treatises: a ''De fide Trinitatis'', and commentaries on the Bible.{{sfn|Page|1909|p=15}} Alcuin is credited with inventing the first known [[question mark]], though it did not resemble the modern symbol.{{sfn|Truss|2003|p=76}} \n \n Alcuin transmitted to the [[Franks]] the knowledge of Latin culture, which had existed in Anglo-Saxon England. A number of his works still exist. Besides some graceful epistles in the style of [[Venantius Fortunatus]], he wrote some long poems, and notably he is the author of a history (in verse) of the church at York, ''Versus de patribus, regibus et sanctis Eboracensis ecclesiae''. At the same time, he is noted for making one of the only explicit comments on [[Old English poetry]] surviving from the early Middle Ages, in a letter to one Speratus, the bishop of an unnamed English [[Episcopal see|see]] (possibly [[Unwona]] of Leicester): {{lang|la| \" verba Dei legantur in sacerdotali convivio: ibi decet lectorem audiri, non citharistam; sermones patrum, non carmina gentilium. Quid [[Hinieldus]] cum Christo? \" }} ( \" Let God's words be read at the episcopal dinner-table. It is right that a reader should be heard, not a harpist, patristic discourse, not pagan song.

However, he argues that it is not possible to necessarily determine whether they were the result of an outward expression of erotic feelings on the part of Alcuin.{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=80}} \n \n The interpretation of homosexual desire has been disputed by [[Allen Frantzen]], who identifies Alcuin's language with that of medieval Christian ''amicitia'' or friendship.{{sfn|Frantzen|1998|p=198}}{{efn |See also {{harvnb|Jaeger|1991}} }} Douglas Dales and [[Rowan Williams]] say  \" the use of language drawn [by Alcuin] from the ''Song of Songs'' transforms apparently erotic language into something within Christian friendship \u2013 'an ordained affection{{' \" }}.{{sfn|Dales|Williams|2013|p=228}} \n \n Alcuin was also a close friend of Charlemagne's sister [[Gisela, Abbess of Chelles]], and he hailed her as  \" a noble sister in the bond of sweet love \" .{{sfn|Dales|2012|p=90}} He wrote to Charlemagne's daughters Rotrudis and Bertha,  \" the devotion of my heart specially tends towards you both because of the familiarity and dedication you have shown me \" .{{sfn|Dales|2012|p=91}} He dedicated the last two books of his commentary on John's gospel to them both.{{sfn|Dales|2012|p=91}} \n \n Despite inconclusive evidence of Alcuin's personal passions, he was clear in his own writings that the men of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] had been punished with fire for  \" sinning against nature with men \" & nbsp;\u2013 a view commonly held by the Church at the time. Such sins, argued Alcuin, were therefore more serious than lustful acts with women, for which the earth was cleansed and revivified by the water of the [[Genesis flood narrative|Flood]], and merit to be  \" withered by flames unto eternal barrenness \" . < ref > {{Cite book |chapter=Interrogationes Sigewulfi in Genesin |editor= J.-P.
