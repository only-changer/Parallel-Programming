He was a monarch from birth as his father, [[Alfonso XII]], had died the previous year. Alfonso's mother, [[Maria Christina of Austria]], served as regent until he assumed full powers on his sixteenth birthday in 1902. \n \n During Alfonso's reign of the [[Restoration (Spain)|Kingdom of Spain]], the country experienced four major problems that contributed to the end of the liberal monarchy: the lack of real political representation of broad social groups; the poor situation of the popular classes, especially peasants; problems arising from the [[Rif War]]; and [[Catalan nationalism]]. The political and social turbulence that began with the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] prevented the turnaround parties from establishing a true [[liberal democracy]], which led to the establishment of the [[dictatorship of Primo de Rivera|dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera]]. With the political failure of the dictatorship, Alfonso impelled a return to the democratic normality with the intention of regenerating the regime.{{cn|date=September 2020}} Nevertheless, it was abandoned by all political classes, as they felt betrayed by the king's support of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. \n \n He left Spain voluntarily after the municipal elections of April 1931, which were taken as a plebiscite on abolishing the monarchy. \n \n Alfonso was nicknamed  \" the Royal Knight of Charity \"  for his unprecedented work with the [[European War Office]] during [[World War I]]. < ref > [https://blogs.loc.gov/international-collections/2018/01/royal-knight-of-charity-king-alfonso-xiii-of-spain-in-wwi/ Anchi Hoh,  \" \u201cRoyal Knight of Charity\u201d: King Alfonso XIII of Spain in WWI \"  in ''Library of Congress'', Jan., 2018] < /ref >  For this great humanitarian endeavour, he was nominated to the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1917, and came close to receiving the award, but this was ultimately won by the [[Red Cross]]. < ref > [https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=687 Nomination Archive.

Seated, from left to right: King Alfonso XIII of Spain, [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]] and [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|King Frederick VIII of Denmark]]]] \n By 1905, Alfonso was looking for a suitable consort. On a state visit to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], he stayed in London at [[Buckingham Palace]] with King [[Edward VII]]. There he met Princess [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]], the daughter of Edward's youngest sister [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]], and a granddaughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. He found her attractive, and she returned his interest. There were obstacles to the marriage. Victoria was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]], and would have to become a Catholic. Victoria's brother Leopold was a [[haemophilia]]c, so there was a 50 percent chance that Victoria was a carrier of the trait. Finally, Alfonso's mother Maria Christina wanted him to marry a member of her family, the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], or some other Catholic princess, as she considered the Battenbergs to be non-dynastic. \n \n Victoria was willing to change her religion, and her being a haemophilia carrier was only a possibility. Maria Christina was eventually persuaded to drop her opposition. In January 1906 she wrote an official letter to Princess Beatrice proposing the match. Victoria met Maria Christina and Alfonso in [[Biarritz]], [[France]], later that month, and converted to Catholicism in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] in March. \n \n [[File:Anarchist attack on the King of Spain Alfonso XIII (1906).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Photograph taken moments after the assassination attempt on Alfonso and [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] on their wedding day]] \n In May, diplomats of both kingdoms officially executed the agreement of marriage. Alfonso and Victoria were married at the [[San Jer\u00f3nimo el Real|Royal Monastery of San Jer\u00f3nimo]] in Madrid on 31 May 1906, with British royalty in attendance, including Victoria's cousins the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]). The wedding was marked by [[Morral affair|an assassination attempt]] on Alfonso and Victoria by Catalan [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist]] Mateu Morral. As the wedding procession returned to the palace, he threw a bomb from a window which killed 30 bystanders and members of the procession, while 100 others were wounded. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://edwardianpromenade.com/weddings/royal-wedding-1-victoria-eugenie-alfonso-xiii/|title=Royal Wedding #1: Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg  &  King Alfonso XIII of Spain|work=Edwardian Promenade|access-date=25 June 2015}} < /ref > \n \n On 10 May 1907, the couple's first child, [[Alfonso, Prince of Asturias (1907\u20131938)|Alfonso, Prince of Asturias]], was born.

Alfonso, who was on holiday in the south of France at the time, was informed of the  \" Disaster of the Annual \"  while he was playing [[golf]]. Reportedly, Alfonso's response to the news was to shrug his shoulders and say  \" Chicken meat is cheap \" , before resuming his game. < ref > Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 284. < /ref >  Alfonso remained in France and did not return to Spain to comfort the families of the soldiers lost in the battle, which many people at the time saw as a callous and cold act, a sign that the King was indifferent over the lives of his soldiers. In 1922, the ''Cortes'' started an investigation into the responsibility for the Annual disaster and soon discovered evidence that the King had been one of the main supporters of Silvestre's advance into the Rif mountains. \n \n [[File:Alfonso XIII in uniform of a British Field Marshall.jpg|thumb|Alfonso in uniform of [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field marshal of the United Kingdom]], 1928]] \n \n After the  \" Disaster of the Annual \" , Spain's war in the Rif went from bad to worse, and as the Spanish were barely hanging onto Morocco, support for the ''abandonistas'' grew as many people could see no point to the war. < ref name= \" Perry, James page 286 \" / >  In August 1923, Spanish soldiers embarking for Morocco mutinied, other soldiers in [[M\u00e1laga]] simply refused to board the ships that were to take them to Morocco, while in Barcelona huge crowds of left-wingers had staged anti-war protests at which Spanish flags were burned while the flag of the [[Republic of the Rif|Rif Republic]] was waved about. < ref name= \" Perry, James page 286 \" / >  With the [[Africanist (Spain)|Africanists]] comprising only a minority, it was clear that it was only a matter of time before the ''abandonistas'' forced the Spanish to give up on the Rif, which was part of the reason for the [[Miguel Primo de Rivera#Establishment of dictatorship|military coup d'\u00e9tat later in 1923]]. < ref name= \" Perry, James page 286 \" / >  On September 13, 1923, General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella|Miguel Primo de Rivera]], seized power in a military coup. He ruled as a dictator with Alfonso's support until 1930. It is believed that one of Alfonso's main reasons for supporting the coup was his desire to suppress the publication of the damning ''Cortes'' report into the Annual disaster. The poetic [[Generation of '27]] as well as Catalan and Basque nationalism grew in this era. \n \n ===Downfall and Second Republic=== \n {{main|Dictablanda of D\u00e1maso Berenguer|1931 Spanish local elections}} \n On 28 January 1930, amid economic problems, general unpopularity and an impending putschist plot led by General [[Manuel Goded]]{{Sfn|Casals|2004|p=211}} of which Alfonso XIII was most probably aware,{{Sfn|Tu\u00f1\u00f3n de Lara|2000|p=225}} Miguel Primo de Rivera was forced to resign, exiling to [[Paris]], only to die a few weeks later of the complications from [[diabetes]] in combination with the effects of a [[flu]].{{Sfn|Casals|2004|p=214\u2013216}} Alfonso XIII appointed General [[D\u00e1maso Berenguer]] as the new Prime Minister, leading to the period known as the ''[[Dictablanda of D\u00e1maso Berenguer|dictablanda]]''. The King was so closely associated with the [[dictatorship of Primo de Rivera]] that it was difficult for him to distance himself from the regime that he had supported for almost seven years. The enforced changes relied on the incorrect assumption that Spaniards would accept the notion that nothing had happened after 1923 and that going back to the prior state of things was possible.{{Sfn|Avil\u00e9s Farr\u00e9|Elizalde P\u00e9rez-Grueso|Sueiro Seoane|2002|p=308}} \n \n In April 1931, General [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]] told him that even the army was not loyal.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} On 12 April, the monarchic parties won a thin majority but lost in major cities in the [[1931 Spanish local elections|1931 municipal elections]], which were perceived as a [[plebiscite]] on monarchy. Alfonso left the country on night of the 14 to 15 April as the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed earlier that day in order to avoid a [[civil war]] but did not formally abdicate. He eventually settled in Rome. \n \n By a law of 26 November 1931, Alfonso was accused by the Cortes of [[high treason]]. < ref > See: [http://boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1931/332/A01250-01250.pdf Ley aprobando el acta acusatoria contra D.

(The Nationalist army included many [[Carlism|Carlist]] supporters of a rival pretender.) Although Alfonso sent his son Juan to Spain in 1936 to participate in the uprising, General [[Emilio Mola]] had Juan arrested near the French border and expelled from the country. \n \n On 29 September 1936, upon the death of [[Infante Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime]], the Carlist pretender, Alfonso also became the senior heir of [[Hugh Capet]] and so was hailed by some French [[legitimists]] as King Alphonse I of France and Navarre. \n \n ===Renunciation of claims to the defunct throne and death=== \n On 15 January 1941, Alfonso XIII renounced his rights to the defunct Spanish throne in favour of Juan. He died of a heart attack in Rome on 28 February of that year. \n \n In Spain, the ''[[caudillo]]'' Franco ordered three days of national mourning. < ref > \" Mourning in Spain \" , ''The Times'' (3 March 1941): 3. < /ref >  His funeral was held in Rome in the Church of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri]].

[[Prince Takamatsu]] travelled with his wife, [[Princess Takamatsu]], to Spain. Her symbolic role in this unique mission to the Spanish Court was intended to emphasize the international links which were forged by her 16th-century ancestor, [[Ieyasu Tokugawa]]. In the years before the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], that innovative ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' from Western Japan had been actively involved in negotiating trade and diplomatic treaties with Spain and with the colonies of New Spain (Mexico) and the Philippines; and it was anticipated that the mere presence of the Princess could serve to underscore the range of possibilities which could be inferred from that little-known history. < ref > [https://www.nytimes.com/1930/11/03/archives/japan-to-decorate-kind-alfonso-today-emperors-brother-nears-madrid.html?sq=order+of+the+chrysanthemum+ & scp=4 & st=p  \" Japan to Decorate King Alfonso Today; Emperor's Brother Nears Madrid With Collar of the Chrysanthemum for Spanish King, \" ] ''New York Times,'' 3 November 1930; ''see also'' Nutail, Zelia.

Considerably more candid than Petrie about Alfonso, the private man, and about the miseries the royal family experienced because of their haemophiliac children. \n *{{cite book| last = Nuttall| first = Zelia| title = The earliest historical relations between Mexico and Japan: from original documents preserved in Spain and Japan| url = https://archive.org/details/earliesthistori00nuttgoog| year = 1906| publisher = The University Press }} \n *[[Charles Petrie (historian)|Petrie, Sir Charles]]. ''King Alfonso XIII and His Age''. London: Chapman  &  Hall, 1963. Written as it was during Queen Ena's lifetime, this book necessarily omits the King's extramarital affairs; but it remains a useful biography, not least because the author knew Alfonso quite well, interviewed him at considerable length, and relates him to the wider Spanish intellectual culture of his time. \n *Pilapil, Vicente R.
