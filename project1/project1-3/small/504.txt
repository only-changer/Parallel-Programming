It was inspired by the time that Gershwin had spent in [[Paris]] and evokes the sights and energy of the French capital in the ''[[Ann\u00e9es folles]]''. \n \n Gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus [[celesta]], saxophones, and automobile horns. He brought back four Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition, which took place on December 13, 1928, in [[Carnegie Hall]], with [[Walter Damrosch]] conducting the [[New York Philharmonic]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf |title=Rhapsody in Blue for Piano and Orchestra : An American in Paris |author=George Gershwin |website=Nyphil.org |access-date=April 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052949/http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > < ref > [https://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/newsroom/1314/Releases/gilbert-ozone-final.pdf Alan Gilbert and the New York Philharmonic: Makoto Ozone to Perform Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue'' in One-Night-Only Concert All-American Program Also to Include Bernstein's ''Candide'' Overture and Symphonic Dances from ''West Side Story'' Gershwin's ''An American in Paris'': April 22, 2014 at nyphil.org] Accessed June 20, 2017 < /ref >  It was Damrosch who had commissioned Gershwin to write the [[Concerto in F]] following the success of ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' (1924). < ref > [https://www.britannica.com/topic/An-American-in-Paris-by-Gershwin  \" ''An American in Paris'' \" ], by Betsy Schwarm, ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' < /ref >   He completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the work's premiere. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition & composition_id=2983 | title = ''An American in Paris'': About the Work | publisher = [[The Kennedy Center]] | author=Richard Freed|author-link=Richard Freed| access-date=December 5, 2012}} < /ref >  He collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer [[Deems Taylor]]. \n \n ==Background== \n Although the story is likely apocryphal, < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EkOfAAAAMAAJ |title=George Gershwin: His Life and Music |last=Schwartz|first=Charles|date=1973|isbn=9780672516627 }}{{page needed|date=December 2019}} < /ref >  Gershwin is said to have been attracted by [[Maurice Ravel]]'s unusual chords, and Gershwin went on his first trip to Paris in 1926 ready to study with Ravel.

In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum.  \" Moderato con grazia \"  is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A.

He stated that Damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with  \" a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses. \"  Critics believed that ''An American in Paris'' was better crafted than his [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]. Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers [[C\u00e9sar Franck]], [[Richard Wagner]], or [[Guillaume Lekeu]] on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics: \n \n {{Quote| \" It's not a Beethoven Symphony, you know... It's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It's not intended to draw tears.

Campbell-Watson simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only three instruments, alto, tenor and baritone. The soprano saxophone doublings were eliminated to avoid changing instruments and the contrabassoon was also deleted. This became the standard performing edition until 2000, when Gershwin specialist [[Jack Gibbons]] made his own restoration of the original orchestration of ''An American in Paris'', working directly from Gershwin's original manuscript, including the restoration of Gershwin's soprano saxophone parts removed in Campbell-Watson's revision; Gibbons' restored orchestration of ''An American in Paris'' was performed at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall on July 9, 2000 by the City of Oxford Orchestra conducted by Levon Parikian. < ref > {{cite web|url= http://www.jackgibbons.com/reviews.htm|title=Musical Opinion review of Gershwin Spectacular|access-date=June 28, 2017 }} < /ref > \n \n [[William Merrigan Daly|William Daly]] arranged the score for piano solo; this was published by New World Music in 1929. < ref > {{Cite web |url=https://ljms.org/directory/ |title=CMS: ''An American in Paris'' Program Notes |last=Rodda |first=Richard E. |date=2013 |website=La Jolla Music Society|access-date=December 11, 2018}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.free-scores.com/download-sheet-music.php?pdf=82579 |title=Free sheet music : Gershwin, George \u2013 ''An American in Paris'' (Piano solo) |website=www.free-scores.com |access-date=December 11, 2018 }} < /ref > \n \n ==Preservation status== \n On September 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological [[Historical editions (music)|critical edition]] of the full orchestral score would be eventually released. The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[University of Michigan]], were working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin's true intent.

The first recording was made for the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Gershwin was on hand to  \" supervise \"  the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. This recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that Gershwin had intended using the notes A-flat, B-flat, a higher D and a lower A. < ref name= \" nytimes1 \"  / >  The radio broadcast of the September 8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which ''An American in Paris,'' also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set. [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music. In 1945, [[Arturo Toscanini]] conducting the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] recorded the piece for [[RCA Victor]], one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer. The [[Seattle Symphony]] also recorded a version in 1990 of Gershwin's original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today. < ref > {{cite web|last=Bargreen |first=Melinda |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900628 & slug=1079541 |title=Entertainment  &  the Arts  & #124; Recordings  & #124; Seattle Times Newspaper |website=Community.seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=June 28, 1990 |access-date=April 6, 2016}} < /ref >  [[Harry James]] released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album ''One Night Stand,'' recorded live at the [[Aragon Ballroom (Chicago)|Aragon Ballroom in Chicago]] ([[Columbia Records|Columbia]] GL 522 and CL 522). \n \n ==Use in film== \n In 1951, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] released the musical film ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', featuring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Leslie Caron]].
