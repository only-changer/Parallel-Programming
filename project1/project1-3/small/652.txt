Commander [[Neil Armstrong]] and lunar module pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]] formed the American crew that landed the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] [[Lunar Module Eagle|''Eagle'']] on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] (14:17 [[Central Standard Time|CST]]). Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the [[spacecraft]], and collected {{convert|47.5|lb|kg}} of lunar material to bring back to [[Earth]]. Command module pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] flew the [[Command Module Columbia|Command Module ''Columbia'']] alone in [[lunar orbit]] while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours, 36 minutes on the lunar surface, at a site they had named [[Tranquility Base]] upon landing, before lifting off to rejoin ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit. \n \n Apollo 11 was launched by a [[Saturn V]] rocket from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on [[Merritt Island, Florida]], on July 16 at 13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth crewed mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]]. The Apollo [[Apollo (spacecraft)|spacecraft]] had three parts: a [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module (CM)]] with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a [[Apollo service module|service module (SM)]], which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module (LM)]] that had two stages\u2014a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit. \n \n After being [[Trans-lunar injection|sent to the Moon]] by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into [[Lunar Module Eagle|''Eagle'']] and landed in the [[Sea of Tranquility]] on July 20. The astronauts used ''Eagle''{{'}}s ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned ''Eagle'' before they performed the maneuvers that propelled ''Columbia'' out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=109}} They returned to Earth and [[Splashdown|splashed down]] in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space. \n \n Armstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on [[Live television|live TV]] to a worldwide audience.

Kennedy]].{{sfn|Logsdon|1976|p=121}} \n \n Since the [[Soviet Union]] had higher lift capacity [[launch vehicle]]s, Kennedy chose, from among options presented by NASA, a challenge beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry, so that the US and Soviet Union would be starting from a position of equality. A crewed mission to the Moon would serve this purpose.{{sfn|Logsdon|1976|pp=112\u2013117}} \n \n On May 25, 1961, Kennedy addressed the [[United States Congress]] on  \" Urgent National Needs \"  and declared:{{quote|I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade [1960s] is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.

Due to design and manufacturing delays in the LM, Apollo{{nbsp}}8 and Apollo{{nbsp}}9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo{{nbsp}}8. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=312\u2013313}} \n \n There would be one change. [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], the CMP on the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 crew, began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=288\u2013289}} Lovell took his place on the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 crew, and when Collins recovered he joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, [[Fred Haise]] filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8.{{sfn|Cunningham|2010|p=109}} Apollo 11 was the second American mission where all the crew members had prior spaceflight experience,{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=90}} the first being Apollo 10.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=72}} The next was [[STS-26]] in 1988.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=90}} \n \n [[Deke Slayton]] gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong had no issues working with Aldrin but thought it over for a day before declining. He thought Lovell deserved to command his own mission (eventually [[Apollo 13]]).{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=338\u2013339}} \n \n The Apollo 11 prime crew had none of the close cheerful camaraderie characterized by that of [[Apollo 12]]. Instead, they forged an amiable working relationship. Armstrong in particular was notoriously aloof, but Collins, who considered himself a loner, confessed to rebuffing Aldrin's attempts to create a more personal relationship.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=434\u2013435}} Aldrin and Collins described the crew as  \" amiable strangers \" .{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=359}} Armstrong did not agree with the assessment, and said  \" ... & nbsp;all the crews I was on worked very well together. \" {{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=359}} \n \n === Backup crew === \n \n {{Spaceflight crew \n |terminology  = Astronaut \n |position1    = Commander \n |crew1_up     = [[Jim Lovell|James A.

Anders had flown with Lovell on Apollo{{nbsp}}8.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=90}} In early 1969, he accepted a job with the [[National Space Council|National Aeronautics and Space Council]] effective August 1969, and announced he would retire as an astronaut at that time. [[Ken Mattingly]] was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch date, at which point Anders would be unavailable.{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=237}} \n \n By the normal crew rotation in place during Apollo, Lovell, Mattingly, and Haise were scheduled to fly on [[Apollo 14]] after backing up for Apollo 11. Later, Lovell's crew was forced to switch places with [[Alan Shepard]]'s tentative [[Apollo 13]] crew to give Shepard more training time.{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=237}} \n \n === Support crew === \n \n During Projects Mercury and Gemini, each mission had a prime and a backup crew. For Apollo, a third crew of astronauts was added, known as the support crew. The support crew maintained the flight plan, checklists and mission ground rules, and ensured the prime and backup crews were apprised of changes. They developed procedures, especially those for emergency situations, so these were ready for when the prime and backup crews came to train in the simulators, allowing them to concentrate on practicing and mastering them.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=261}} For Apollo 11, the support crew consisted of Ken Mattingly, [[Ronald Evans (astronaut)|Ronald Evans]] and [[William R.

At Lovell's suggestion, he chose the [[bald eagle]], the [[national bird]] of the United States, as the symbol. Tom Wilson, a simulator instructor, suggested an [[olive branch]] in its beak to represent their peaceful mission. Collins added a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. The sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction; the shadow should have been in the lower part of the Earth instead of the left. Aldrin, Armstrong and Collins decided the Eagle and the Moon would be in their natural colors, and decided on a blue and gold border. Armstrong was concerned that  \" eleven \"  would not be understood by non-English speakers, so they went with  \" Apollo 11 \" ,{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=332\u2013334}} and they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would  \" be representative of ''everyone'' who had worked toward a lunar landing \" .{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=332}} \n \n An illustrator at the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] (MSC) did the artwork, which was then sent off to NASA officials for approval.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=332\u2013334}} The design was rejected. [[Bob Gilruth]], the director of the MSC felt the talons of the eagle looked  \" too warlike \" .{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=333}} After some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the talons.{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=333}} When the [[Eisenhower dollar|Eisenhower dollar coin]] was released in 1971, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://coinsite.com/CoinSite-PF/pparticles/$1eisen.asp |title=1971\u201378 Dollar Eisenhower |work=CoinSite |publisher=ROKO Design Group, Inc. |date=1994 |access-date=July 20, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830064148/http://www.coinsite.com/CoinSite-PF/pparticles/$1eisen.asp |archive-date=August 30, 2013 |url-status=dead }} < /ref >  The design was also used for the smaller [[Susan B.

The name ''Snowcone'' was used for the CM and ''Haystack'' was used for the LM in both internal and external communications during early mission planning.{{sfn|Marshall Space Flight Center|1969|p=8}} \n \n The LM was named ''[[Lunar Module Eagle|Eagle]]'' after the motif which was featured prominently on the mission insignia. At Scheer's suggestion, the CM was named ''[[Command module Columbia|Columbia]]'' after ''[[Columbiad#In fiction|Columbiad]]'', the giant cannon that launched a spacecraft (also from Florida) in [[Jules Verne]]'s 1865 novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]''.

Aldrin heard that Armstrong would be the first because Armstrong was a civilian, which made Aldrin livid. Aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first, but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign. Attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict, Slayton told Aldrin that Armstrong would be first since he was the commander. The decision was announced in a press conference on April 14, 1969.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=363\u2013365}} \n \n For decades, Aldrin believed the final decision was largely driven by the lunar module's hatch location. Because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and the spacecraft was so small, maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult. The crew tried a simulation in which Aldrin left the spacecraft first, but he damaged the simulator while attempting to egress. While this was enough for mission planners to make their decision, Aldrin and Armstrong were left in the dark on the decision until late spring.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=149}} Slayton told Armstrong the plan was to have him leave the spacecraft first, if he agreed. Armstrong said,  \" Yes, that's the way to do it. \" {{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=150}} \n \n The media accused Armstrong of exercising his commander's prerogative to exit the spacecraft first.{{sfn|Schefter|1999|p=281}} [[Chris Kraft]] revealed in his 2001 autobiography that a meeting occurred between Gilruth, Slayton, Low, and himself to make sure Aldrin would not be the first to walk on the Moon.
