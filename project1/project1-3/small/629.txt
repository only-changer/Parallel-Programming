Its name means  \" [[pump]] \"  in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]; it represents an [[air pump]]. Originally '''Antlia Pneumatica''', the constellation was established by [[Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille]] in the 18th century. Its non-specific (single-word) name, already in limited use, was preferred by [[John Herschel]] then welcomed by the astronomic community which officially accepted this. North of stars forming some of the sails of the ship [[Argo Navis]] (the constellation [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]]), Antlia is completely visible from latitudes south of [[49th parallel north|49 degrees north]]. \n \n Antlia is a faint constellation; its brightest star is [[Alpha Antliae]], an orange [[giant star|giant]] that is a suspected [[variable star]], ranging between [[apparent magnitude]]s 4.22 and 4.29. [[S Antliae]] is an [[Binary star#Eclipsing binaries|eclipsing binary]] star system, changing in brightness as one star passes in front of the other. Sharing a [[common envelope]], the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets, [[HD 93083]] and [[WASP-66]], lie within Antlia, as do [[NGC 2997]], a [[spiral galaxy]], and the [[Antlia Dwarf|Antlia Dwarf Galaxy]]. \n \n ==History== \n [[File:Antlia bode.JPG|thumb|upright=1.38|left|Johann Bode's depiction of Antlia as a double-cylinder air pump]] \n The French astronomer [[Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille]] first described the constellation in French as ''la Machine Pneumatique'' (the Pneumatic Machine) in 1751\u201352, < ref name=ridpathlac > {{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm |title=Lacaille's Southern Planisphere of 1756 |work=Star Tales |author=Ridpath, Ian |author-link=Ian Ridpath |publisher=Self-published |access-date=25 August 2015}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |author=Lacaille, Nicolas Louis |date=1756 |title=Relation abr\u00e9g\u00e9e du Voyage fait par ordre du Roi au cap de Bonne-esp\u00e9rance |journal=M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences |pages=519\u2013592 [589] |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k35505/f787 |language=fr}} < /ref >  commemorating the [[air pump]] invented by the French physicist [[Denis Papin]]. < ref name= \" startales \" > {{cite web |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |work= Star Tales |title= Antlia |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/antlia.htm |access-date=3 December 2007}} < /ref >  De Lacaille had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the [[Cape of Good Hope]], devising fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere]] not visible from Europe.
