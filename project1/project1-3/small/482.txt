For instance, the amide derived from [[acetic acid]] is named [[acetamide]] (CH < sub > 3 < /sub > CONH < sub > 2 < /sub > ). IUPAC recommends [[ethanamide]], but this and related formal names are rarely encountered. When the amide is derived from a primary or secondary amine, the substituents on nitrogen are indicated first in the name. Thus, the amide formed from [[dimethylamine]] and [[acetic acid]] is ''N'',''N''-dimethylacetamide (CH < sub > 3 < /sub > CONMe < sub > 2 < /sub > , where Me = CH < sub > 3 < /sub > ). Usually even this name is simplified to [[dimethylacetamide]]. Cyclic amides are called [[lactam]]s; they are necessarily secondary or tertiary amides. < ref > Organic Chemistry IUPAC Nomenclature.

In fact the O, C and N atoms have [[molecular orbital]]s occupied by [[delocalized electron]]s, forming a [[conjugated system]].  Consequently, the three bonds of the nitrogen in amides is not pyramidal (as in the amines) but planar. This planar restriction prevents rotations about the N linkage and thus has important consequences for the mechanical properties of bulk material of such molecules, and also for the configurational properties of macromolecules built by such bonds.  The inability to rotate distinguishes amide groups from ester groups which allow rotation and thus create more flexible bulk material. \n \n The structure of an amide can be described also as a [[resonance structure|resonance]] between two alternative structures: \n :[[File:AmideResonance.png|300px]] \n \n It is estimated that for acetamide, structure A makes a 62% contribution to the structure, while structure B makes a 28% contribution.  (These figures do not sum to 100% because there are additional less-important resonance forms that are not depicted above). There is also a hydrogen bond present between the active groups hydrogen and nitrogen atoms. < ref name = Kemnitz > {{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja0663024|title= \" Amide Resonance \"  Correlates with a Breadth of C\u2212N Rotation Barriers|year=2007|last1=Kemnitz|first1=Carl R.|last2=Loewen|first2=Mark J.|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=129|issue=9|pages=2521\u20138|pmid=17295481}} < /ref >  Resonance is largely prevented in the very strained [[quinuclidone]]. \n < !--needs: \n barrier from DMF, and a more general ref than this JACS rpt \n comment on syn and anti secondary amides-- > \n \n ===Basicity=== \n Compared to [[amine]]s, amides are very weak [[base (chemistry)|base]]s. While the [[conjugate acid]] of an [[amine]] has a [[pKa|p''K'' < sub > a < /sub > ]] of about 9.5, the [[conjugate acid]] of an amide has a p''K'' < sub > a < /sub >  around \u22120.5. Therefore, amides don't have as clearly noticeable [[acid\u2013base]] properties in [[water]]. This relative lack of basicity is explained by the withdrawing of electrons from the amine by the carbonyl. On the other hand, amides are much stronger [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s than [[carboxylic acid]]s, [[ester]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, and [[ketone]]s (their conjugate acids' p''K'' < sub > a < /sub > s are between \u22126 and \u221210). \n \n The proton of a primary or secondary amide does not dissociate readily under normal conditions; its p''K'' < sub > a < /sub >  is usually well above 15. Conversely, under extremely acidic conditions, the carbonyl [[oxygen]] can become protonated with a p''K'' < sub > a < /sub >  of roughly \u22121. It is not only because of the positive charge on the nitrogen, but also because of the negative charge on the oxygen gained through resonance. \n \n ===Hydrogen bonding and solubility=== \n Because of the greater electronegativity of oxygen, the carbonyl (C=O) is a stronger dipole than the N\u2013C dipole. The presence of a C=O dipole and, to a lesser extent a N\u2013C dipole, allows amides to act as H-bond acceptors. In primary and secondary amides, the presence of N\u2013H dipoles allows amides to function as H-bond donors as well. Thus amides can participate in [[hydrogen bonding]] with water and other protic solvents; the oxygen atom can accept hydrogen bonds from water and the N\u2013H hydrogen atoms can donate H-bonds. As a result of interactions such as these, the water solubility of amides is greater than that of corresponding hydrocarbons.  These hydrogen bonds are also have an important role in the [[secondary structure]] of proteins. \n \n The [[Solubility|solubilities]] of amides and esters are roughly comparable. Typically amides are less soluble than comparable amines and carboxylic acids since these compounds can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds. Tertiary amides, with the important exception of [[Dimethylformamide|''N'',''N''-dimethylformamide]], exhibit low solubility in water. \n \n ===Characterization=== \n The presence of the amide group \u2013C(=O)N\u2013 is generally easily established, at least in small molecules. It can be distinguished from nitro and cyano groups in [[IR spectroscopy|IR spectra]]. Amides exhibit a moderately intense ''\u03bd'' < sub > CO < /sub >  band near 1650 & nbsp;cm < sup > \u22121 < /sup > . By  < sup > 1 < /sup > H [[NMR spectroscopy]], CON'''H'''R signals occur at low fields. In X-ray crystallography, the C(=O)N center together with the three immediately adjacent atoms characteristically define a plane. \n \n ==Reactions == \n < !-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] -- > \n :[[File:Acid-CatAmideHydrolMarch.png|320 px|thumb|Mechanism for acid-mediated hydrolysis of an amide. < ref > {{March6th}} < /ref > ]] \n Amides undergo many chemical reactions, although they are less reactive than esters.  Amides hydrolyse in hot [[alkali]] as well as in strong [[acid]]ic conditions. Acidic conditions yield the carboxylic acid and the ammonium ion while basic hydrolysis yield the carboxylate ion and ammonia.  The protonation of the initially generated amine under acidic conditions and the deprotonation of the initially generated carboxylic acid under basic conditions render these processes non-catalytic and irreversible.  Amides are also versatile precursors to many other [[functional group]]s. Electrophiles react with the [[carbonyl]] oxygen. This step often precedes hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by both [[Br\u00f8nsted acid]]s and [[Lewis acid]]s.   Enzymes, e.g. [[peptidase]]s and artificial catalysts, are known to accelerate the hydrolysis reactions. \n \n {| class= \" wikitable sortable \"  style= \" background-color:white;float: center; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0em 1em; \"  border= \" 1 \"  cellpadding= \" 2 \"  cellspacing= \" 0 \" \n \n ! width=200px|Reaction name !!
