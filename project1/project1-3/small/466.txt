This conference currently contains 16 teams organized into 4 [[Division (sport)|divisions]], as does its counterpart, the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC). Both conferences were created as part of the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|1970 merger]] between the National Football League, and the [[American Football League]] (AFL). All ten of the AFL teams, and three NFL teams, became members of the new AFC, with the remaining thirteen NFL teams forming the NFC. A series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger, thus making the current total of 16 teams in each conference. The current AFC champions are the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], who defeated the [[Buffalo Bills]] in the 2020 [[AFC Championship Game]] for their second consecutive conference championship. \n \n ==Teams== \n Like the NFC, the conference has 16 teams organized into four [[Division (sport)|divisions]] each with four teams: [[AFC East|East]], [[AFC North|North]], [[AFC South|South]] and [[AFC West|West]]. < ref > {{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25549819/2019-nfl-pro-bowl-selections-all-32-teams-full-nfc-afc-rosters|title=2019 Pro Bowl selections for every team: Full NFC, AFC rosters|date=2018-12-19|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-23}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/sports/football/parity-afc-becomes-a-conference-of-haves-and-have-nots.html|title=Parity?

The [[2020 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs in 2020]] (highlighted in green) finished in first place in the [[AFC West]]. Thus, [[2021 Kansas City Chiefs season|in 2021]], the Chiefs are scheduled to play two games against each of its division rivals (highlighted in light blue), one game against each team in the [[AFC North]] and [[NFC East]] (highlighted in yellow), and one game each against the first-place finishers in the [[AFC East]], [[AFC South]] (highlighted in orange), and [[NFC North]] (highlighted in pink). < /div > \n < /div > \n < /div > \n Currently, the fourteen opponents each team faces over the 17-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula: \n \n Each AFC team plays the other teams in their respective division twice (home and away) during the regular season, in addition to eleven other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL: three games are assigned on the basis of a particular team's final divisional standing from the previous season, and the remaining eight games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle. Using the 2021 regular season schedule as an example, each team in the AFC West plays against every team in the AFC North and NFC East. In this way, non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents \u2013 the exception being the three games assigned based on the team's prior-season divisional standing. \n \n At the end of each season, the four division winners and three [[Wild card (sports)|wild cards]] (non-division winners with best regular season record) in the AFC qualify for the [[NFL playoffs|playoffs]]. The AFC playoffs culminate in the [[AFC Championship Game]], with the winner receiving the [[Lamar Hunt]] Trophy. The AFC champion then plays the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] champion in the [[Super Bowl]]. \n \n ==History== \n [[File:Oldafclogo.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Original American Football Conference logo, based on the AFL logo with blue stars]] \n Both the AFC and the NFC were created after the NFL [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merged]] with the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in 1970. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.worldalmanacforkids.com/WAKI-ViewArticle.aspx?pin=x-fo055624a & article_id=608 & chapter_id=13 & chapter_title=Sports & article_title=Pro_Football_History|title=Pro Football \u2013 History|access-date=April 3, 2009}} < /ref >  The AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams, and added two more expansion clubs (the [[Miami Dolphins]] in 1966 and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in 1968) before the merger. In order to equalize the number of teams in each conference, three NFL teams that predated the AFL's launch (the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and the then-[[Baltimore Colts]]) joined the ten former AFL teams to form the AFC. The two AFL divisions [[AFL East]] and [[AFL West]] were more or less intact, while the NFL's [[National Football League Century Division|Century Division]], in which the Browns and the Steelers had played since 1967, was moved from the NFL to become the new AFC Central. Upon the completion of the merger of the AFL and NFL in 1970, the newly minted American Football Conference had already agreed upon their divisional setup along mostly geographical lines for the [[1970 NFL season|1970 season]]; the National Football Conference, however, could not agree upon their setup, and one was chosen from a fishbowl on January 16, 1970. \n \n Since the merger, five expansion teams have joined the AFC and two have left, thus making the current total 16. When the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively. This arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences. The Seahawks eventually returned to the NFC as a result of the [[2002 NFL season#Expansion and realignment|2002 realignment]]. The expansion [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] joined the AFC in 1995. There have been five teams that have relocated at least once. In 1984, the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|relocated]] to Indianapolis. In 1995, the [[Cleveland Browns]] had attempted to move to Baltimore; the resulting [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|dispute]] between Cleveland and the team led to Modell establishing the [[Baltimore Ravens]] with the players and personnel from the Browns, while the Browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the NFL. The Ravens were treated as an expansion team. \n \n In [[California]], the [[Oakland Raiders]] relocated to [[Los Angeles]] in 1982, back to Oakland in 1995, and then to [[Las Vegas]] in 2020, while the [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] returned to [[Los Angeles]] in 2017 after 56 years in [[San Diego]]. \n \n The [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]] moved to [[Tennessee]] in 1997, where they were renamed the Tennessee Oilers. The team would change its name again, two years later, to the [[Tennessee Titans]]. \n \n The NFL would again expand in 2002, adding the [[Houston Texans]] to the AFC. With the exception of the aforementioned relocations since that time, the divisional setup has remained static ever since. \n \n Between 1995 and 2019, the AFC has sent only half of its 16 teams to the [[Super Bowl]]: [[New England Patriots]] (10 times), [[Denver Broncos]] (4 times), [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (4 times), [[Baltimore Ravens]] (2 times), [[Indianapolis Colts]] (2 times), [[Kansas City Chiefs]] (1 time), [[Las Vegas Raiders]] (1 time), and [[Tennessee Titans]] (1 time). By contrast, the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] has sent 13 of the 16 NFC teams during that same time frame with only the [[Detroit Lions]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], and [[Washington Football Team]] missing out on an appearance in the [[Super Bowl]]. 16 of the last 19 AFC champions have started one of just three quarterbacks - [[Tom Brady]], [[Peyton Manning]] and [[Ben Roethlisberger]] - in the Super Bowl. The AFC has started 6 quarterbacks in the last 19 Super Bowls, while the NFC has started 16. \n \n ==Logo== \n [[Image:American Football Conference logo old.svg|right|thumb|2nd American Football Conference logo used from 1970 to 2009|216x216px]] \n The merged league created a new logo for the AFC that took elements of the old AFL logo, specifically the  \" A \"  and the six stars surrounding it. The AFC logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009. The 2010 NFL season introduced an updated AFC logo, with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars (leaving four representing the four divisions of the AFC), and moving the stars inside the letter, similar to the NFC logo. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/03/02/but-i-absolutely-refuse-to-write-about-the-draft-caps/ |title=But I Absolutely Refuse to Write About the Draft Caps |author=Paul Lukas |publisher=Uni Watch blog |access-date=April 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506134900/http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/03/02/but-i-absolutely-refuse-to-write-about-the-draft-caps/ |archive-date=May 6, 2010 |url-status=dead  }} < /ref > \n \n ==Television== \n [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] aired the AFC's Sunday afternoon and playoff games from 1970 through the 1997 season.
