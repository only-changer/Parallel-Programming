It was captured by the [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthians]] in 625 BC and was situated about {{convert|11|km|abbr=on|0}} from the [[Ambracian Gulf]], on a bend of the navigable river [[Arachthos River|Arachthos]] (or Aratthus), in the midst of a fertile wooded plain. < ref name= \" OCD \" > {{Citation  | last = Hammond  | first = Nicholas Geoffrey Lempri\u00e8re  | author-link=N.

The early policy of Ambracia was determined by its loyalty to Corinth (for which it probably served as an entrepot in the [[Epirus]] trade), and its consequent aversion to [[Corcyra]] (as Ambracia participated on the Corinthian side at the [[Battle of Sybota]], which took place in 433 BC between the rebellious Corinthian colony of Corcyra (modern Corfu) and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]).{{sfn|Caspari|1911}} \n \n Ambraciot politics featured many frontier disputes with the [[Amphilochians]] and [[Acarnanians]].  Hence it took a prominent part in the [[Peloponnesian War]] until the crushing defeat at [[Battle of Idomene|Idomene]] (426), which crippled its resources.{{sfn|Caspari|1911}} \n \n In the 4th century BC it continued its traditional policy, but in 338 was besieged by [[Philip II of Macedon]]. With the assistance of Corinth and Athens, it escaped complete domination at Philip's hands, but was nevertheless forced to accept a Macedonian garrison. < ref name= \" OCD \" / >   In 294 BC, after forty-three years of semi-autonomy under [[Macedon]]ian suzerainty, Ambracia was given by the son of [[Cassander]] to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], who made it his capital, and adorned it with palace, temples and theatres.  In the wars of [[Philip V of Macedon]] and the Epirotes against the [[Aetolian League]] (220\u2013205) Ambracia passed from one alliance to the other, but ultimately joined the latter confederacy.  During the struggle of the Aetolians against [[Roman Republic|Rome]], it stood a stubborn [[siege]],{{sfn|Caspari|1911}} including the first known use of [[poison gas]] against the Romans' [[Tunnel warfare|siege tunnels]]. < ref > [[Polybius]] 21.28 < /ref > \n \n Ambracia was captured and plundered by [[Marcus Fulvius Nobilior (consul 189 BC)|Marcus Fulvius Nobilior]] in 189 BC, after which it was declared by Rome a  \" free city \" , and gradually fell into insignificance. < ref name= \" OCD \" / > {{sfn|Caspari|1911}}  The foundation by [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]] of [[Nicopolis]], into which the remaining inhabitants were drafted, left the site desolate.  In [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times a new settlement took its place under the name of [[Arta, Greece|Arta]]. Some fragmentary walls of large, well-dressed blocks near this latter town indicate the early prosperity of Ambracia.{{sfn|Caspari|1911}} \n \n ==Ambraciotes== \n \n ===Artists=== \n *[[Epigonus of Ambracia]], 6th BC musician \n *Nicocles, [[auletes]] \n *Hippasus, tragic actor \n *[[Epicrates of Ambracia]], c. 4th BC comic poet < ref > [https://books.google.com/books?id=HrPd7zRmDu0C & pg=PA204 & dq=Epicrates+comic+poet biographical sketch online]. < /ref > \n \n ===Athletes=== \n *Sophron, [[Stadion (running race)|Stadion]] [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympics]] 432 BC < ref > [[Chronicon (Eusebius)]], [[Diodorus]]- > [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en & q=Sophron+of+Ambracia+ & um=1 & ie=UTF-8 & sa=N & tab=wp] < /ref > \n *Tlasimachus, [[Chariot racing|Tethrippon]] and [[Synoris]] Olympics  296 BC < ref > [[Phlegon of Tralles]],Olympiads- > [http://www.google.com/search?um=1 & q=Tlasimachus+ & sa=N & tab=pw] < /ref > \n *Andromachus, Stadion Olympics 60 BC < ref > [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en & q=++180th+%5B60+B.C.%5D+-+Andromachus+of+Ambracia+ & btnG=Search Chronicon (Eusebius)] < /ref > \n \n ===Various=== \n *[[Silanus of Ambracia]], 5th BC seer \n *Cleombrotus of Ambracia, student of [[Plato]][http://www.google.com/search?hl=en & q=Cleombrotus+of+Ambracia+Agathias+Callimachus+Plato & btnG=Search] \n \n ==See also== \n *[[List of cities in ancient Epirus]] \n *[[List of ancient Greek cities]] \n \n == References == \n {{reflist}} \n \n '''Attribution:''' \n *{{EB1911|first=Max Otto Bismarck |last=Caspari|wstitle=Ambracia|volume=1|pages=797-798}} \n \n {{coord|39.158|N|20.987|E|display=title|source:eswiki}} \n {{Commons category|Ambracia}} \n \n [[Category:Cities in ancient Epirus]] \n [[Category:Populated places established in the 7th century BC]] \n [[Category:Corinthian colonies]] \n [[Category:Former populated places in Greece]] \n [[Category:Populated places in ancient Acarnania]] \n [[Category:Populated places in ancient Epirus]] \n [[Category:Pyrrhus of Epirus]] \n [[Category:Archaeological sites in Epirus (region)]] \n [[Category:Arta, Greece]]"
