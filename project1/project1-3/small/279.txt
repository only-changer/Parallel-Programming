Subsequent generations in the city would be strongly influenced by the tide of [[Baroque]] styles pre-eminent in other parts of Italy. \n \n Freedberg derides Allori as derivative, claiming  he illustrates  \" the ideal of Maniera by which art (and style) are generated out of pre-existing art. \"  The polish of figures has an unnatural marble-like form as if he aimed for cold statuary. It can be said of late phase mannerist painting in Florence, that the city that had early breathed life into statuary with the works of masters like [[Donatello]] and [[Michelangelo]], was still so awed by them that it petrified the poses of figures in painting. While by 1600 the Baroque elsewhere was beginning to give life to painted figures, Florence was painting two-dimensional statues. Furthermore, in general, with the exception of the Counter-''Maniera'' ([[Counter-Mannerism]]) artists, it dared not stray from high themes or stray into high emotion. \n \n Among his collaborators was [[Giovanni Maria Butteri]] and his main pupil was [[Giovanni Bizzelli]]. Cristoforo del Altissimo,  [[Cesare Dandini]], [[Aurelio Lomi]], John Mosnier, [[Alessandro Pieroni]], [[Giovanni Battista Vanni]], and Monanni also were his pupils. < ref > Hobbes J.R. page 5 < /ref >  Allori was one of the artists, working under [[Vasari]], included in the decoration of the [[Studiolo of Francesco I|Studiolo of Francesco & nbsp;I]]. \n \n He was the father of the painter [[Cristofano Allori]] (1577\u20131621). \n \n ==Main works== \n [[Image:Alessandro Allori 002.jpg|thumb|''Christ with Mary and Martha'', oil on wood, 125 x 118 cm < br > Kunsthistorisches Museum]] \n * ''Portrait of a Young Man'' (1561; [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]) \n * ''Christ and the Samaritan Woman'' (Altarpiece, 1575, [[Santa Maria Novella]], now Prato) \n * ''Road to Calvary''  (1604, Rome) \n * ''Dead Christ and Angels'', (Museum Fine Arts, Budapest) < ref name= \" wga \" > [http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/a/allori/alessand/ Web Gallery of Art, image collection, virtual museum, searchable database of European fine arts (1100-1850) < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref > \n * ''Portrait of Piero de M\u00e9dici'', ([[S\u00e3o Paulo Art Museum]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]) \n * ''Pearl Fishing'' (1570\u201372, Studiolo of Francesco I, Palazzo Vecchio, Florence)[https://web.archive.org/web/20030708080615/http://www.ocaiw.com/jmpopera.php?id=18012 image] \n * ''[[:Image:AlloriSusanna.jpg|Susanna and the Elders]]'' (202 \u00d7 117 & nbsp;cm, [[mus\u00e9e Magnin]], [[Dijon]]) \n * ''Allegory of Human Life'' < ref name= \" wga \" / > \n * ''The Miracle of St. Peter Walking on Water'' < ref name= \" wga \" / > \n * ''Venus and Cupid'', < ref name= \" wga \" / >  ([[mus\u00e9e Fabre]], [[Montpellier]]) \n * Additions to [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s ''[[Tribute to Caesar (del Sarto and Allori)|Tribute to Caesar]]'' (1582; [[Villa di Poggio a Caiano]]) \n \n In 2006 the BBC foreign correspondent [[Charles Wheeler (journalist)|Sir Charles Wheeler]] returned an original Alessandro Allori painting to the [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin]].
