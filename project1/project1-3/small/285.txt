The captain of the club, wishing to retain Fleming in the team, suggested that he join the research department at St Mary's, where he became assistant bacteriologist to Sir [[Almroth Wright]], a pioneer in [[vaccine]] therapy and immunology. In 1908, he gained a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] degree with gold medal in [[Bacteriology]], and became a lecturer at St Mary's until 1914. \n \n Commissioned lieutenant in 1914 and promoted captain in 1917, < ref name= \" Kelly \"  / >  Fleming served throughout [[World War I]] in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], and was [[Mentioned in Dispatches]].

Serving as Temporary Lieutenant of the Royal Army Medical Corps, he witnessed the death of many soldiers from [[sepsis]] resulting from infected [[wound]]s.

Antiseptics worked well on the surface, but deep wounds tended to shelter [[anaerobic bacteria]] from the antiseptic agent, and antiseptics seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least as well as they removed bacteria, and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach. < ref name= \" Flavine \" > {{cite journal |last1=FLEMING |first1=ALEXANDER |title=The Physiological and Antiseptic Action of Flavine (With Some Observations on the Testing of Antiseptics) |journal=The Lancet |date=September 1917 |volume=190 |issue=4905 |pages=341\u2013345 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)52126-1 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/2098298 }} < /ref >  Wright strongly supported Fleming's findings, but despite this, most army physicians over the course of the war continued to use antiseptics even in cases where this worsened the condition of the patients. < ref name= \" Fleming bio \" > {{cite journal | last= Mazumdar |first=PM | title = Fleming as Bacteriologist: Alexander Fleming | journal = Science | volume = 225 | issue = 4667 | pages = 1140\u20131141 | year = 1984 | pmid = 17782415 | doi = 10.1126/science.225.4667.1140 | bibcode = 1984Sci...225.1140C }} < /ref > \n \n === Discovery of lysozyme === \n {{main|Lysozyme}} \n At St Mary's Hospital, Fleming continued his investigations into bacteria culture and antibacterial substances. As his research scholar at the time V.D. Allison recalled, Fleming was not a tidy researcher and usually expected unusual bacterial growths in his culture plates. Fleming had teased Allison of his  \" excessive tidiness in the laboratory, \"  and Allison rightly attributed such untidiness as the success of Fleming's experiments, and said,  \" [If] he had been as tidy as he thought I was, he would not have made his two great discoveries. \" < ref name= \" :0 \" > {{Cite journal|last=Allison|first=V.

In the next test, he used bacteria maintained in saline that formed an yellow suspension. Within two minutes of adding fresh mucus, the yellow saline turned completely clear. He extended his tests using tears, which were contributed by his co-workers. As Allison reminisced, saying,  \" For the next five or six weeks, our tears were the source of supply for this extraordinary phenomenon. Many were the lemons we used (after the failure of onions) to produce a flow of tears... The demand by us for tears was so great, that laboratory attendants were pressed into service, receiving threepence for each contribution. \" < ref name= \" :0 \"  / > \n \n His further tests with sputum, cartilage, blood, semen, ovarian cyst fluid, pus, and egg white showed that the bactericidal agent was present in all of these. < ref name= \" :3 \"  / >  He reported his discovery before the Medical Research Club in December and before the [[Royal Society]] the next year but failed to stir any interest, as Allison recollected: < blockquote > \n \n I was present at this [Medical Research Club] meeting as Fleming's guest. His paper describing his discovery was received with no questions asked and no discussion, which was most unusual and an indication that it was considered to be of no importance. The following year he read a paper on the subject before the Royal Society, Burlington House, Piccadilly and he and I gave a demonstration of our work. Again with one exception little comment or attention was paid to it. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / > < /blockquote > \n \n Reporting in the 1 May 1922 issue of the ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]]'' under the title  \" On a remarkable bacteriolytic element found in tissues and secretions, \"  Fleming wrote: < blockquote > In this communication I wish to draw attention to a substance present in the tissues and secretions of the body, which is capable of rapidly dissolving certain bacteria. As this substance has properties akin to those of ferments I have called it a  \" [[Lysozyme]], \"  and shall refer to it by this name throughout the communication. The lysozyme was first noticed during some investigations made on a patient suffering from [[Rhinitis|acute coryza]]. < ref name= \" :2 \"  / > < /blockquote > This was the first recorded discovery of lysozyme.
