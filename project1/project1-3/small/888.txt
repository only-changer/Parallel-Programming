The autosome pairs are labeled with numbers (1\u201322 in humans) roughly in order of their sizes in base pairs, while allosomes are labelled with their letters. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=auto some|title=Resources|first1=Genetics Home|last1=Reference|website=Genetics Home Reference|access-date=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102070828/http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=autosome|archive-date=2 January 2016}} < /ref >  By contrast, the allosome pair consists of two [[X chromosome]]s in females or one X and one [[Y chromosome]] in males. Unusual combinations of [[XYY syndrome|XYY]], [[Klinefelter syndrome|XX]], [[Triple X syndrome|XXX]], [[XXXX syndrome|XXXX]], [[XXXXX syndrome|XXXXX]] or [[XXYY syndrome|XXYY]], among [[Aneuploidy|other Salome combinations]], are known to occur and usually cause developmental abnormalities. \n \n Autosomes still contain sexual determination genes even though they are not sex chromosomes. For example, the [[SRY]] gene on the Y chromosome encodes the transcription factor [[Testis determining factor|TDF]] and is vital for male sex determination during development. TDF functions by activating the [[SOX9]] gene on [[Chromosome 17 (human)|chromosome 17]], so mutations of the [[SOX9]] gene can cause humans with an ordinary Y chromosome to develop as females. < ref name= \" pmid7990924 \" > {{cite journal | vauthors = Foster JW, Dominguez-Steglich MA, Guioli S, Kwok C, Weller PA, Stevanovi\u0107 M, Weissenbach J, Mansour S, Young ID, Goodfellow PN | title = Complicate dysplasia and autosomal sex reversal caused by mutations in an SRY-related gene | journal = Nature | volume = 372 | issue = 6506 | pages = 525\u201330 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7990924 | doi = 10.1038/372525a0 | bibcode = 1994Natur.372..525F | s2cid = 1472426 }} < /ref > \n \n All human autosomes have been identified and mapped by extracting the chromosomes from a cell arrested in [[metaphase]] or [[prometaphase]] and then staining them with a type of dye (most commonly, [[Giemsa stain|Giemsa]]). < ref > {{Cite web |title=Chromosome mapping Facts, information, pictures |series=Encyclopedia.com articles about Chromosome mapping |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Chromosome_mapping.aspx |website=encyclopedia.com |access-date=2015-12-04 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210220706/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Chromosome_mapping.aspx |archive-date=2015-12-10 |df=dmy-all}} < /ref >  These chromosomes are typically viewed as [[karyogram]]s for easy comparison.

Autosomal genetic disorders which exhibit Mendelian inheritance can be inherited either in an [[autosomal dominant]] or recessive fashion. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >  These disorders manifest in and are passed on by either sex with equal frequency. < ref name= \" :0 \" > {{Cite web|title = human genetic disease|url = http://www.britannica.com/science/human-genetic-disease|website = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date = 2015-10-16|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151013183225/http://www.britannica.com/science/human-genetic-disease|archive-date = 2015-10-13}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Chial |first1=Heidi |year=2008 |title=Mendelian Genetics: Patterns of Inheritance and Single-Gene Disorders |journal=Nature Education |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=63 |url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/mendelian-genetics-patterns-of-inheritance-and-single-966/ }} < /ref >  Autosomal dominant disorders are often present in both parent and child, as the child needs to inherit only one copy of the deleterious [[allele]] to manifest the disease. Autosomal recessive diseases, however, require two copies of the deleterious allele for the disease to manifest. Because it is possible to possess one copy of a deleterious allele without presenting a disease phenotype, two phenotypically normal parents can have a child with the disease if both parents are carriers (also known as [[heterozygote]]s) for the condition. \n \n Autosomal [[aneuploidy]] can also result in disease conditions. Aneuploidy of autosomes is not well tolerated and usually results in miscarriage of the developing fetus.
