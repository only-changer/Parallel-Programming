[[Royal Society]], London.]] \n '''Astronomer Royal''' is a senior post in the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom]]. There are two officers, the senior being the Astronomer Royal dating from 22 June 1675; the second is the [[Astronomer Royal for Scotland]] dating from 1834. \n \n The post was created by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1675, at the same time as he founded the [[Royal Observatory Greenwich]]. He appointed [[John Flamsteed]], instructing him  \" {{sic|hide=y|forthwith to apply himself with |the most exact care and diligence to the rectifying the tables of the motions of the heavens, and the places of the fixed stars, so as to find out the so-much desired longitude of places, for the perfecting the art of navigation}}. \" < ref > F Baily,  \" An Account of the Rev.

After the separation of the two offices, the position of Astronomer Royal has been largely honorary, though they remain available to advise the Sovereign on astronomical and related scientific matters, and the office is of great prestige. < ref name= \" monarchywebsite \" > {{cite web \n   | url = http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/OfficialRoyalposts/AstronomerRoyal.aspx \n   | title = Astronomer Royal \n   | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160308012357/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/OfficialRoyalposts/AstronomerRoyal.aspx \n   | archive-date = 2016-03-08 \n   | website = [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|The British Monarchy]] \n   | publisher = [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]]  \n   | url-status = dead \n   | access-date = 2017-06-23 \n }} < /ref > \n \n There was also formerly a [[Royal Astronomer of Ireland]], a post that seemingly ended with [[Irish Free State|Irish independence]]. \n \n The Astronomer Royal is mentioned in [[H.G.
