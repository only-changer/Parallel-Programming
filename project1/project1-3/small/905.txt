It has no etymological connection in French with [[Agincourt, Meurthe-et-Moselle]] (attested as ''Egincourt'' 875), which is derived from another Germanic male name ''*Ingin-''. < ref > [[Albert Dauzat]] and [[Charles Rostaing]], ''Dictionnaire \u00e9tymologique des noms de lieux en France'', \u00e9ditions Larousse 1968. p. 4. < /ref > \n The battle was named after a nearby castle  called Azincourt. The modern settlement has in turn been named after the battle in the 17th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} \n \n ==History== \n Azincourt is famous as being near the site of the battle fought on 25 October 1415 in which the army led by King [[Henry V of England]] defeated the forces led by [[Charles d'Albret]] on behalf of [[Charles VI of France]], which has gone down in history as the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. According to M. Forrest, the French knights were so encumbered by their armour that they were exhausted even before the start of the battle. < ref > The House of Commons: 1509 \u2013 1558, Volume 4; Stanley T.

J. Scarisbrick, p. 23 < /ref >  so that he could emulate him, on the grounds that he thought that launching a campaign against France would help him to impose himself on the European stage. In 1513, Henry VIII crossed the English Channel, stopping by at Azincourt. \n \n {{wide image|AGINCOURT.hto3.jpg|800px|The battlefield today|left}} \n \n The battle, as was the tradition, was named after a nearby castle called Azincourt.  The castle has since disappeared and the settlement now known as Azincourt adopted the name in the seventeenth century. < ref > John Cassell's Illustrated History of England, vol. 1 (1857), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=RS4OAAAAQAAJ & pg=PA534  p. 532]. < /ref > \n \n [[John Cassell]] wrote in 1857 that  \" the village of Azincourt itself is now a group of dirty farmhouses and wretched cottages, but where the hottest of the battle raged, between that village and the commune of [[Tramecourt]], there still remains a wood precisely corresponding with the one in which Henry placed his ambush; and there are yet existing the foundations of the castle of Azincourt, from which the king named the field. \" < ref > John Cassell's Illustrated History of England, vol. 1 (1857), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=RS4OAAAAQAAJ & pg=PA534  p. 534]. < /ref > \n \n ==Population== \n {{Historical populations \n |align=left \n |2005|286 \n |2006|290 \n |2007|291 \n |2008|297 \n |2009|302 \n |2010|307 \n |2011|305 \n |2012|303 \n |2013|303 \n |2014|302 \n |2015|301 \n |2016|303 \n }} \n {{clear-left}} \n \n ==Sights== \n The original battlefield museum in the village featured model knights made out of [[Action Man]] figures.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} This has now been replaced by the Centre historique m\u00e9di\u00e9val d'Azincourt (CHM){{mdash}}a more professional museum, conference centre and exhibition space incorporating laser, video, slide shows, audio commentaries, and some interactive elements. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://illucolor.fr/7_vallees_comm/Azincourt/index.html|title=Azincourt Centre Historique|date=20 February 2018}} < /ref >  The museum building is shaped like a [[longbow]] similar to those used at the battle by [[archery|archer]]s under King Henry. \n \n Since 2004 a large medieval festival organised by the local community, the CHM, The Azincourt Alliance, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.azincourt-alliance.org.uk/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001204190300/http://www.azincourt-alliance.org.uk/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 December 2000 |title=Azincourt Alliance Home Page }} < /ref >  and various other UK societies commemorating the battle, local history and medieval life, arts and crafts has been held in the village. < ref > [http://www.azincourt-alliance.org.uk/  \" Videos from Azincourt \"  at ''Azincourt Alliance''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203110608/http://www.azincourt-alliance.org.uk/ |date=3 February 2014 }} < /ref >  Prior to this date the festival was held in October, but due to the inclement weather and local heavy clay soil (like the battle) making the festival difficult, it was moved to the last Sunday in July.  \n [[File:Azincourt.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Commemorative monument near to the battlefield]] \n \n ==International relations== \n {{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in France}} \n \n Azincourt is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with [[Middleham]], United Kingdom. < ref name= \" Archant twinning 3 \" > {{cite web|url=http://www.completefrance.com/language-culture/twin-towns|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705094933/http://www.completefrance.com/language-culture/twin-towns|title=British towns twinned with French towns ''[via WaybackMachine.com]''|access-date=20 July 2013|archive-date=5 July 2013|work=Archant Community Media Ltd}} < /ref > \n \n ==See also== \n * [[Communes of the Pas-de-Calais department]] \n * The neighbourhood of [[Agincourt, Toronto]], Canada, named for Azincourt, not [[Agincourt, Meurthe-et-Moselle]] \n \n ==References== \n * [http://www.insee.fr/fr/methodes/nomenclatures/cog/fichecommunale.asp?codedep=62 & codecom=066 INSEE commune file] \n {{Reflist}} \n \n {{Commons category|Azincourt}} \n \n {{Pas-de-Calais communes}} \n {{authority control}} \n \n [[Category:Communes of Pas-de-Calais]]"
