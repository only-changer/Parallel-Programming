He was one of the [[Five Good Emperors]] from the [[Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty]]. < ref name= \" Bowman, p. 150 \" > Bowman, p. 150 < /ref > \n \n Born into a senatorial family, Antoninus held various offices during the reign of Emperor [[Hadrian]]. He married Hadrian's niece [[Faustina the Elder|Faustina]], and Hadrian adopted him as his son and successor shortly before his death. Antoninus acquired the [[cognomen]] [[Pius]] after his accession to the throne, either because he compelled the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deify]] his adoptive father, < ref > Birley, p. 54; Dio, 70:1:2 < /ref >  or because he had saved senators sentenced to death by Hadrian in his later years. < ref > Birley, p. 55, citing the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', ''Life of Hadrian'' 24.4 < /ref >  His reign is notable for the peaceful state of the Empire, with no major revolts or military incursions during this time, and for his governing without ever leaving Italy. A successful military campaign in southern Scotland early in his reign resulted in the construction of the [[Antonine Wall]].  \n \n Antoninus was an effective administrator, leaving his successors a large surplus in the treasury, expanding free access to drinking water throughout the Empire, encouraging legal conformity, and facilitating the enfranchisement of freed slaves. He died of illness in 161 and was succeeded by his adopted sons [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]] as co-emperors. \n \n ==Early life== \n ===Childhood and family=== \n Antoninus was born near [[Lanuvium]] (modern-day [[Lanuvio]] in Italy) to [[Titus Aurelius Fulvus]], [[consul]] in 89, and Arria Fadilla. < ref name= \" Bowman, p. 150 \" > Bowman, p. 150 < /ref > < ref > {{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Paul B.|title=Religion in republican Italy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|page=134}} < /ref >  The Aurelii Fulvi were an [[Aurelia (gens)|Aurelian]] family settled in [[Nemausus]] (modern [[N\u00eemes]]). < ref name= \" Bury, p. 523 \" > Bury, p. 523 < /ref >  Titus Aurelius Fulvius was the son of a senator of the same name, who, as legate of [[Legio III Gallica]], had supported [[Vespasian]] in his bid to the Imperial office and been rewarded with a suffect consulship, plus an ordinary one under [[Domitian]] in 85.

For Antoninus came to his new office with simple tastes, kindly disposition, extensive experience, a well-trained intelligence and the sincerest desire for the welfare of his subjects. Instead of plundering to support his prodigality, he emptied his private treasury to assist distressed provinces and cities, and everywhere exercised rigid economy (hence the nickname \u03ba\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2  \" cummin-splitter \" ). Instead of exaggerating into treason whatever was susceptible of unfavorable interpretation, he turned the very conspiracies that were formed against him into opportunities for demonstrating his clemency. Instead of stirring up [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution against the Christians]], he extended to them the strong hand of his protection throughout the empire. Rather than give occasion to that oppression which he regarded as inseparable from an emperor's progress through his dominions, he was content to spend all the years of his reign in Rome, or its neighbourhood.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}}} \n \n Some historians have a less positive view of his reign. According to the historian [[J. B. Bury]], \n {{Blockquote|however estimable the man, Antoninus was hardly a great statesman. The rest which the Empire enjoyed under his auspices had been rendered possible through Hadrian's activity, and was not due to his own exertions; on the other hand, he carried the policy of peace at any price too far, and so entailed calamities on the state after his death. He not only had no originality or power of initiative, but he had not even the insight or boldness to work further on the new lines marked out by Hadrian. < ref > Bury, p. 524 < /ref > }} \n \n German historian [[Ernst Kornemann]] has had it in his ''R\u00f6mische Geschichte'' [2 vols., ed. by H. Bengtson, Stuttgart 1954] that the reign of Antoninus comprised  \" a succession of grossly wasted opportunities \" , given the upheavals that were to come. There is more to this argument, given that the Parthians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Antoninus' death. Kornemann's brief is that Antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders. [[Michael Grant (classicist)|Michael Grant]] agrees that it is possible that had Antoninus acted decisively sooner (it appears that, on his death bed, he was preparing a large-scale action against the Parthians), the Parthians might have been unable to choose their own time, but current evidence is not conclusive. Grant opines that Antoninus and his officers did act in a resolute manner dealing with frontier disturbances of his time, although conditions for long-lasting peace were not created. On the whole, according to Grant, Marcus Aurelius' eulogistic picture of Antoninus seems deserved, and Antoninus appears to have been a conservative and nationalistic (although he respected and followed Hadrian's example of Philhellenism moderately) Emperor who was not tainted by the blood of either citizen or foe, combined and maintained Numa Pompilius' good fortune, pacific dutifulness and religious scrupulousness, and whose laws removed anomalies and softened harshnesses. < ref > {{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Michael|title=The Antonines: The Roman Empire in Transition|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317972112|pages=14\u201323|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FwfDAAAQBAJ & pg=PT28}} < /ref > \n \n Krzysztof Ulanowski argues that the claims of military inability are exaggerated, considering that although the sources praise Antoninus' love for peace and his efforts  \" rather to defend, than enlarge the provinces \" , he could hardly be considered a pacifist, as shown by the conquest of the Lowlands, the building of the [[Antonine Wall]] and the expansion of Germania Superior. Ulianowski also praises Antoninus for being successful in deterrence by diplomatic means. < ref > {{cite book|last1=Ulanowski|first1=Krzysztof|title=The Religious Aspects of War in the Ancient Near East, Greece, and Rome: Ancient Warfare Series, Volume 1|date=2016|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004324763|pages=360\u2013361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KX6kDAAAQBAJ & pg=PA358}} < /ref > \n \n ==Descendants== \n Although only one of his four children survived to adulthood, Antoninus came to be ancestor to four generations of prominent Romans, including the Emperor [[Commodus]].
