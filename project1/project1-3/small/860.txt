This culminated in publications such as the 1981 first edition of the [[Macquarie Dictionary]], a major English language dictionary based on Australian usage, and the 1988 first edition of [[The Australian National Dictionary]], a historical dictionary documenting the history of Australian English vocabulary and idiom. \n \n ==Phonology and pronunciation== \n {{Main|Australian English phonology}} \n The most obvious way in which Australian English is distinctive from other varieties of English is through its unique pronunciation.

The long vowels, which include [[monophthong]]s and [[diphthong]]s, mostly correspond to the [[tense vowel]]s used in analyses of [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) as well as its centring diphthongs. The short vowels, consisting only of monophthongs, correspond to the RP lax vowels. \n \n There exist pairs of long and short vowels with overlapping vowel quality giving Australian English [[vowel length|phonemic length distinction]], which is also present in some regional south-eastern dialects of the UK and eastern seaboard dialects in the US. < ref > {{cite web|first=Robert| last=Mannell |url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/impressionistic.html |title=Australian English \u2013 Impressionistic Phonetic Studies |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au|date=14 August 2009|access-date=26 July 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110706114743/http://clas.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/impressionistic.html| archive-date= 6 July 2011 | url-status= live}} < /ref >  An example of this feature is the distinction between ''ferry'' {{IPA|/\u02c8fe\u0279i\u02d0/}} and ''fairy'' {{IPA|/\u02c8fe\u02d0\u0279i\u02d0/}}. \n \n As with New Zealand English and General American English, the [[weak-vowel merger]] is complete in Australian English: unstressed {{IPA|/\u026a/}} is merged into {{IPA|/\u0259/}} ([[schwa]]), unless it is followed by a velar consonant. Examples of this feature are the following pairings, which are pronounced identically in Australian English: ''Rosa's'' and ''roses'', as well as ''Lennon'' and ''Lenin''. Other examples are the following pairs, which rhyme in Australian English: ''abbott'' with ''rabbit'', and ''dig it'' with ''bigot''. \n \n Most varieties of Australian English exhibit only a partial [[trap-bath split]]. The words ''bath'', ''grass'' and ''can't'' are always pronounced with the  \" long \"  {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} of ''father''. Conversely, throughout the majority of the country, the  \" flat \"  {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} of ''man'' is the dominant pronunciation for the ''a'' vowel in the following words: ''dance'', ''advance'', ''plant'', ''example'' and ''answer''. The exception is the state of [[South Australia]], where a more advanced trap-bath split has taken place, and where the dominant pronunciation of all the preceding words incorporates the  \" long \"  {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} of ''father''. \n \n {|class=wikitable \n |- \n ! colspan= \" 4 \"  |monophthongs \n ! colspan= \" 2 \"  rowspan= \" 2 \"  |diphthongs \n |- \n ! colspan= \" 2 \"  |short vowels \n ! colspan= \" 2 \"  |long vowels \n |- \n ! valign= \" top \"  align= \" center \"  |IPA \n !examples \n ! valign= \" top \"  align= \" center \"  |IPA \n !examples \n ! valign= \" top \"  align= \" center \"  |IPA \n !examples \n |- \n |\u028a \n |''f'''oo'''t'', ''h'''oo'''d'', ''ch'''oo'''k'' \n |\u0289\u02d0 < ref group= \" nb \" > The vowel /\u0289\u02d0/ is diphthongised in all the major Australian accents; in General Australian, the most widespread Australian accent, the vowel is pronounced as [\u00ef\u026f].

As with many non-rhotic dialects, [[Linking R|linking {{IPA|/r/}}]] can occur when a word that has a final  < r >  in the spelling comes before another word that starts with a vowel. An [[Linking and intrusive R#Intrusive R|intrusive {{IPA|/r/}}]] may similarly be inserted before a vowel in words that do not have  < r >  in the spelling in certain environments, namely after the long vowel {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} and after word final {{IPA|/\u0259/}}. This can be heard in  \" law-r-and order, \"  where an intrusive R is voiced after the W and before the A. \n \n As with North American English, [[Intervocalic alveolar flapping]] is a feature of Australian English: prevocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} surface as the [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}} after [[sonorant]]s other than {{IPA|/m, \u014b/}} as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel in the same breath group. Examples of this feature are that the following pairs are pronounced similarly or identically: ''latter'' and ''ladder'', as well as ''rated'' and ''raided''. \n \n [[English consonant-cluster reductions#Yod-dropping|''Yod''-dropping]] generally occurs after {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} but not after {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}. Accordingly, ''suit'' is pronounced as {{IPA|/su\u02d0t/}}, ''lute'' as {{IPA|/\u02c8lu\u02d0t/}}, ''Zeus'' as {{IPA|/\u02c8zu\u02d0s/}} and ''enthusiasm'' as {{IPA|/\u025bn\u02c8\u03b8u\u02d0zi\u00e6z\u0259m/}}; however ''tune'' is pronounced as {{IPA|//\u02c8tju\u02d0n/}}, ''dew'' as {{IPA|/\u02c8dju\u02d0/}} and ''new'' as {{IPA|//\u02c8nju\u02d0/}}. Other cases of {{IPA|/sj/}} and {{IPA|/zj/}}, along with {{IPA|/tj/}} and {{IPA|/dj/}}, have [[English consonant-cluster reductions#Yod-coalescence|coalesced]] to {{IPA|/\u0283/}}, {{IPA|/\u0292/}}, {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/d\u0292/}} respectively for many speakers. {{IPA|/j/}} is generally retained in other [[consonant cluster]]s. \n \n In common with most varieties of [[Scottish English]] and [[American English]], the phoneme {{IPA|/l/}} is pronounced as a  \" dark \"  (velarised) ''l'' ({{IPA|[\u026b]}}) in all positions, unlike other dialects such as [[Received Pronunciation]] and [[Hiberno-English|Hiberno (Irish) English]], where a light ''l'' (i.e. a non-velarised ''l'') is used in many positions. \n \n The [[wine\u2013whine merger]] is complete in Australian English. \n \n ===Pronunciation=== \n Differences in stress, weak forms and standard pronunciation of isolated words occur between Australian English and other forms of English, which while noticeable do not impair intelligibility. \n \n The affixes ''-ary'', ''-ery'', ''-ory'', ''-bury'', ''-berry'' and ''-mony'' (seen in words such as ''necessary, mulberry'' and ''matrimony'') can be pronounced either with a full vowel or a schwa. Although some words like ''necessary'' are almost universally pronounced with the full vowel, older generations of Australians are relatively likely to pronounce these affixes with a schwa while younger generations are relatively likely to use a full vowel. \n \n Words ending in unstressed ''-ile'' derived from Latin adjectives ending in ''-ilis'' are pronounced with a full vowel ({{IPA|/\u0251\u026al/}}), so that ''fertile'' sounds like ''fur tile'' rather than rhyming with ''turtle''. \n \n In addition, miscellaneous pronunciation differences exist when compared with other varieties of English in relation to various isolated words. For example, as with American English, the vowel in ''yoghurt'' and the prefix ''homo-'' (as in ''homosexual'' or ''homophobic'') is pronounced as {{IPA|/\u0252\u0289/}} ( \" long o \" ) rather than {{IPA|/\u0254/}} ( \" short o \" ); ''vitamin'', ''migraine'' and ''privacy'' are pronounced with {{IPA|/\u0251\u026a/}} (as in ''mine'') rather than {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, {{IPA|/i:/}} and {{IPA|/\u026a/}} respectively; the prefix ''paedo-'' (as in ''paedophile'') is pronounced with /e/ (as in ''red'') rather than {{IPA|/i:/}}; many loanwords with {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} in British English (e.g. ''pasta'') are pronounced with {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}}; ''urinal'' is stressed on the first syllable and pronounced with [[schwa]] {{IPA|/\u0259/}} rather than the second syllable and {{IPA|/\u0251\u026a/}} ( \" long i \" ); ''harass'' and ''harassment'' are pronounced with the stress on the second, rather than the first syllable; and the suffix ''-sia'' (as in ''[[Malaysia]]'', ''[[Indonesia]]'' and ''[[Polynesia]]'') is pronounced {{IPA|/-\u2060\u0292\u0259/}} rather than {{IPA|/-zi:\u0259/}}, and the word ''foyer'' is pronounced /\u02c8fo\u026a\u0259/, rather than /\u02c8fo\u026a\u00e6\u026a/. As with British English, ''advertisement'' is stressed on the second syllable and pronounced with {{IPA|/\u026a\u031d/}}; ''tomato'' and ''vase'' are pronounced with {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}} (as in ''father'') instead of {{IPA|/\u0250\u026a/}}; ''zebra'' is pronounced with /e/ (as in ''red'') rather than {{IPA|/i:/}}; ''basil'' is pronounced with {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} ( \" short a \" ) rather than {{IPA|/\u0250\u026a/}} ( \" long a \" ); and ''buoy'' is pronounced as {{IPA|/bo\u026a/}} (as in ''boy'') rather than {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u0289:i:/}}.

Some relatively minor regional differences in pronunciation exist. A limited range of [[Word usage|word choice]]s is strongly regional in nature. Consequently, the geographical background of individuals may be inferred if they use words that are peculiar to particular Australian states or territories and, in some cases, even smaller regions. In addition, some Australians speak [[English-based creole languages|creole languages]] derived from Australian English, such as [[Australian Kriol language|Australian Kriol]], [[Torres Strait Creole]] and [[Norfuk language|Norfuk]]. \n \n Academic research has also identified notable [[culture|sociocultural]] variation within Australian English, which is mostly evident in phonology. < ref > {{cite web|first=Robert | last=Mannell |url=http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/impressionistic.html |title=Robert Mannell,  \" Impressionistic Studies of Australian English Phonetics \"  |publisher=Ling.mq.edu.au |date=14 August 2009 |access-date=26 July 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081231163640/http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/impressionistic.html| archive-date=31 December 2008| url-status= live}} < /ref > \n \n ===Regional variation=== \n Although Australian English is relatively homogeneous, there are some regional variations. The dialects of English spoken in the various [[states and territories of Australia]] differ slightly in vocabulary and phonology. \n \n Most regional differences are in word usage. Swimming clothes are known as ''cossies'' (pronounced  \" cozzies \" ) or ''swimmers'' in New South Wales, ''togs'' in Queensland, and ''bathers'' in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-05/what-do-you-call-battered-deep-fried-potato-snack-linguistic/7069684|title=Divide over potato cake and scallop, bathers and togs mapped in 2015 Linguistics Roadshow|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|author=Kellie Scott|date=5 January 2016|access-date=5 January 2016}} < /ref >  What Queensland calls a ''stroller'' is usually called a ''pram'' in Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales, and Tasmania. < ref name= \" Pauline Bryant 1985 \" > Pauline Bryant (1985): Regional variation in the Australian English lexicon, Australian Journal of Linguistics, 5:1, 55\u201366 < /ref > \n \n Preference for some synonymous words also differ between states. ''Garbage'' (i.e., garbage bin, garbage truck) dominates over ''rubbish'' in New South Wales and Queensland, while ''rubbish'' is more popular in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia. < ref name= \" Pauline Bryant 1985 \" / > \n \n Additionally, the word ''footy'' generally refers to the most popular [[Football in Australia|football code]] in an area; that is, [[rugby league]] or [[rugby union]] depending on the local area, in most of New South Wales and Queensland, and [[Australian rules football]] elsewhere. In some pockets of Melbourne  &  Western Sydney it will refer to [[Association football]]. Beer glasses are also [[Australian English vocabulary#Alcohol|named differently]] in different states. Distinctive grammatical patterns exist such as the use of the interrogative ''eh'' (also spelled ''ay'' or ''aye''), which is particularly associated with Queensland. ''[[Secret Santa]]'' and ''Kris Kringle'' are used in all states, with the former being more common in Queensland. \n \n ;South Australia \n The most pronounced variation in phonology is between [[South Australia]] and the other states and territories. The [[trap\u2013bath split]] is more complete in South Australia, in contrast to the other states and territories in which it more complete. Accordingly, words such as ''dance'', ''advance'', ''plant'', ''example'' and ''answer'' are pronounced with {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} (as in ''father'') far more frequently in South Australia while the older {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} (as in ''mad'') is dominant elsewhere in Australia. < ref name= \" Pauline Bryant 1985 \" / >  [[L-vocalization|''L''-vocalisation]] is also more common in South Australia than other states. \n \n ;Centring diphthongs \n In Western Australian and Queensland English, the vowels in ''near'' and ''square'' are typically realised as centring diphthongs ( \" nee-ya \" ), whereas in the other states they may also be realised as monophthongs. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/regional-accents |title=regional accents  & #124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |access-date=26 July 2011}} < /ref > \n \n ;Salary-celery merger \n A feature common in Victorian English is [[English-language vowel changes before historic l#Salary\u2013celery merger|salary\u2013celery merger]], whereby a Victorian pronunciation of ''Ellen'' may sound like ''Alan'' and Victoria's capital city ''[[Melbourne]]'' may sound like ''Malbourne'' to speakers from other states. There is also regional variation in {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} before {{IPA|/l/}} (as in ''school'' and ''pool''). \n \n ;Full-fool allophones \n In some parts of Australia, notably Victoria, a fully backed allophone of {{IPA|/\u0289\u02d0/}}, transcribed {{IPA|[\u028a\u02d0]}}, is common before {{IPA|/l/}}. As a result, the pairs full/fool and pull/pool differ phonetically only in vowel length for those speakers. The usual allophone for {{IPA|//\u0289\u02d0/}} is further forward in Queensland and New South Wales than Victoria and the aforementioned pairs do not rhyme. \n \n ===Sociocultural=== < !-- [[General Australian]] redirects here-- > \n The General Australian accent serves as the [[standard language|standard variety]] of English across the country.

There are distinctive features of accent, grammar, words and meanings, as well as language use. \n \n Academics have also noted the emergency of numerous ethnocultural dialects of Australian English that are spoken by people from some [[Minority group|minority]] non-English speaking backgrounds. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/australian-english |title=australian english  & #124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=30 July 2010 |access-date=26 July 2011}} < /ref >  These ethnocultural varieties contain features of General Australian English as adopted by the children of immigrants blended with some non-English language features, such as [[Afro-Asiatic]] languages and [[Asian languages|languages of Asia]].

''Dinkum'', or ''fair dinkum'' means  \" true \"  or  \" is that true? \" , among other things, depending on context and inflection. < ref > [http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/pubs/ozwords/November_98/index.html Frederick Ludowyk, 1998,  \" Aussie Words: The Dinkum Oil On Dinkum; Where Does It Come From? \"  (''0zWords'', Australian National Dictionary Centre)].

For example, ''creek'' in Australia, as in North America, means a stream or small river, whereas in the UK it is typically a watercourse in a marshy area; ''paddock'' in Australia means field, whereas in the UK it means a small enclosure for livestock; ''bush'' or ''scrub'' in Australia, as in North America, means a wooded area, whereas in England they are commonly used only in proper names (such as [[Shepherd's Bush]] and [[Wormwood Scrubs]]). \n \n Some elements of [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]] have been [[List of English words of Australian Aboriginal origin|adopted by Australian English]]\u2014mainly as names for places, flora and fauna (for example [[dingo]]) and local culture. Many such are localised, and do not form part of general Australian use, while others, such as ''kangaroo'', ''boomerang'', ''budgerigar'', ''wallaby'' and so on have become international. Other examples are ''[[cooee]]'' and ''hard yakka''. The former is used as a high-pitched call, for attracting attention, (pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8k\u0289\u02d0i\u02d0/}}) which travels long distances. ''Cooee'' is also a notional distance: ''if he's within cooee, we'll spot him''. ''Hard yakka'' means ''hard work'' and is derived from ''yakka'', from the [[Turrubal language|Jagera]]/Yagara language once spoken in the Brisbane region. Also of Aboriginal origin is the word ''bung'', from the Sydney [[pidgin]] English (and ultimately from the Sydney Aboriginal language), meaning  \" dead \" , with some extension to  \" broken \"  or  \" useless \" . Many towns or suburbs of Australia have also been influenced or named after Aboriginal words.

This may also be done with people's names to create [[nickname]]s (other English speaking countries create [[English diminutive|similar diminutives]]). For example,  \" Gazza \"  from Gary, or  \" Smitty \"  from John Smith. The use of the suffix ''-o'' originates in {{lang-ga|\u00f3}},{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}} which is both a postclitic and a suffix with much the same meaning as in Australian English. \n \n In informal speech, incomplete comparisons are sometimes used, such as  \" sweet as \"  (as in  \" That car is sweet as. \" ).  \" Full \" ,  \" fully \"  or  \" heaps \"  may precede a word to act as an intensifier (as in  \" The waves at the beach were heaps good. \" ). This was more common in regional Australia and South Australia{{When|date=September 2014}} but has been in common usage in urban Australia for decades. The suffix  \" -ly \"  is sometimes omitted in broader Australian English.

Grammatical differences between varieties of English are minor relative to differences in phonology and vocabulary and do not generally affect intelligibility. Examples of grammatical differences between Australian English and other varieties include: \n *Collective nouns are generally singular in construction, e.g., ''the government was unable to decide'' as opposed to ''the government were unable to decide'' or ''the group was leaving'' as opposed to ''the group were leaving''. < ref > {{cite journal |last=Pena |first=Yolanda Fernandez |date=5 May 2016 |title=What Motivates Verbal Agreement Variation with Collective Headed Subjects |journal=University of Vigo LVTC}} < /ref >  This is in common with [[American English]]. \n *The past tense and past participles of the verbs ''learn'', ''spell'' and ''smell'' are often irregular (''learnt'', ''spelt'', ''smelt'') in Australian English. < ref > https://about.abc.net.au/abc-editorial/the-abc-style-guide/ < /ref >  This also the case in [[British English]]. \n *Australian English has an 'extreme distaste' for the modal verbs ''shall'' (in non-legal contexts), ''shan't'' and ''ought'' (in place of ''will'', ''won't'' and ''should'' respectively), which are encountered in British English. < ref name= \" Collins 2012 \" > {{cite journal |last=Collins |first=Peter |date=2012 |title=Australian English: Its Evolution and Current State |journal=International Journal of Language, Translation and Intercultural Communication|volume=1 |page=75 |doi=10.12681/ijltic.11 }} < /ref > \n *Using ''should'' with the same meaning as ''would'', e.g. ''I should like to see you'', encountered in British English, is almost never encountered in Australian English. \n *''River'' follows the name of the river in question, e.g., ''Brisbane River'', rather than the British convention of coming before the name, e.g., ''River Thames''. This is also the case in [[North American English]]. In [[South Australian English]] however, the reverse applies when referring to the following three rivers: [[Murray River|Murray]], [[Darling River|Darling]] and [[River Torrens|Torrens]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.sa.gov.au/topics/planning-and-property/planning-and-land-management/suburb-road-and-place-names/geographical-names-guidelines |title=Geographical names guidelines |author= < !--Not stated-- >  |date=August 2020 |website=Planning and property |publisher=Attorney-General's Department (Government of South Australia) |access-date=8 February 2021 }} < /ref > \n *While prepositions before days may be omitted in American English, i.e., ''She resigned Thursday'', they are retained in Australian English: ''She resigned on Thursday''. This is shared with British English.  \n *The institutional nouns ''hospital'' and ''university'' do not take the [[definite article]]: ''She's in hospital'', ''He's at university''. < ref > {{cite book |last=Siegel |first=Jeff |date=2010 |title=Second Dialect Acquisition |isbn=978-0-521-51687-7}} < /ref >  This is in contrast to American English where ''the'' is required: ''In the hospital'', ''At the university''. \n *''On the weekend'' is used in favour of the British ''at the weekend'' which is not encountered in Australian English. < ref > {{cite book |last=Hewings |first=Matthew |date=1999 |title=Advanced Grammar in Use |page=214}} < /ref > \n *Ranges of dates use ''to'', i.e., ''Monday to Friday'', rather than ''Monday through Friday''. This is shared with British English and is in contrast to American English. \n *When speaking or writing out numbers, ''and'' is always inserted before the tens, i.e., ''one hundred and sixty-two'' rather than ''one hundred sixty-two''. This is in contrast to American English. \n *The preposition ''to'' in ''write to'' (e.g. ''I'll write to you'') is always retained, as opposed to American usage where it may be dropped.  \n *Australian English does not share the British usage of ''read'' (v) to mean ''study'' (v). Therefore, it may be said that ''He studies medicine'' but not that ''He reads medicine''. \n *When referring to time, Australians will refer to 10:30 as ''half past ten'' and do not use the British ''half ten''. Similarly, ''a quarter to ten'' is used for 9:45 rather than ''(a) quarter of ten'', which is sometimes found in American English. \n *Australian English does not share the British English meaning of ''sat'' to include ''sitting'' or ''seated''. Therefore, uses such as ''I've been sat here for an hour'' are not encountered in Australian English. \n *To ''have a shower'' or ''have a bath'' are the most common usages in Australian English, in contrast to American English which uses ''take a shower'' and ''take a bath''. < ref > {{cite book |last=Cetnarowska |first=Bozena |date=1993 |title=The Syntax, Semantics and Derivation of Bare Normalisations in English |page=48 |isbn=83-226-0535-8}} < /ref > \n *The past participle of ''saw'' is ''sawn'' (e.g. ''sawn-off shotgun'') in Australian English, in contrast to the American English ''sawed''. \n *The verb ''visit'' is transitive in Australian English. Where the object is a person or people, American English also uses ''visit with'', which is not found in Australian English. \n *An outdoor event which is cancelled due to inclement weather is ''rained out'' in Australian English. This is in contrast to British English where it is said to be ''rained off''. < ref > \" The Macquarie Dictionary \" , Fourth Edition. The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, 2005 < /ref > < ref > \" Collins English Dictionary \" , 13th Edition. HarperCollins, 2018 < /ref > \n *In informal speech, sentence-final ''but'' may be used, e.g. ''I dont want to go but'' in place of ''But I don't want to go''. < ref name= \" Collins 2012 \" / >  This is also found in [[Scottish English]]. \n *In informal speech, the [[discourse marker]]s ''yeah no'' (or ''yeah nah'') and ''no yeah'' (or ''nah yeah'') may be used to mean ''no'' and ''yes'' respectively. < ref > {{cite thesis |type=Honours |last=Moore |first=Erin |date=2007 |title=Yeah-no: A Discourse Marker in Australian English |publisher=University of Melbourne}} < /ref > \n \n ==Spelling and style== < !-- [[Australian spelling]] redirects here-- > \n As in all English-speaking countries, there is no central authority that prescribes official usage with respect to matters of [[orthography|spelling]], grammar, punctuation or style. \n \n ===Spelling=== \n [[File:Eighth edition cover.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Macquarie Dictionary]], commonly used as a reference for Australian English spelling]] \n There are several dictionaries of Australian English which adopt a [[linguistic description|descriptive]] approach. The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' is most commonly used by [[University|universities]], governments and courts as the [[standardization (linguistics)|standard]] for Australian English spelling. The [[Australian Oxford Dictionary]] is another commonly-used dictionary of Australian English. \n \n Australian spelling is significantly closer to [[American and British English spelling differences|British]] than [[American and British English spelling differences|American spelling]], as it did not adopt the systematic [[spelling reform|reforms]] promulgated in [[Noah Webster]]'s [[Webster's Dictionary|1828 Dictionary]]. Notwithstanding, the Macquarie Dictionary often lists various American spellings as acceptable secondary variants. The minor systematic differences which occur between Australian and American spelling are summarised below: < ref name= \" Macquarie Dictionary 8th Edition \" > \" The Macquarie Dictionary \" , 8th Edition. Macquarie Dictionary Publishers, 2020. < /ref > \n * French-derived words which in American English end with '''or''', such as ''col'''or''''', ''hon'''or''''' and ''lab'''or''''', are spelt with '''our''' in Australian English: ''col'''our''''', ''hon'''our''''' and ''lab'''our'''''. An exception is the [[Australian Labor Party]] which uses the '''or''' spelling. Some (especially [[South Australia|SA]]) placenames use  \" Harb'''or''' \" , notably [[Victor Harbor, South Australia|Victor Harbor]]. \n * Words which in American English end with '''ize''', such as ''real'''ize''''', ''recogn'''ize''''' and ''organ'''ize''''' are spelt with '''ise''' in Australian English: ''real'''ise''''', ''recogn'''ise''''' and ''organ'''ise'''''. The British [[Oxford spelling]], which uses the '''ize''' endings, is not used in Australian English. \n * Words which in American English end with '''yze''', such as ''anal'''yze''''', ''paral'''yze''''' and ''catal'''yze''''' are spelt with '''yse''' in Australian English: ''anal'''yse''''', ''paral'''yse''''' and ''catal'''yse'''''. \n * French-derived words which in American English end with '''er''', such as ''fib'''er''''', ''cent'''er''''' and ''met'''er''''' are spelt with '''re''' in Australian English: ''fib'''re''''', ''cent'''re''''' and ''met'''re''''' (the unit of measurement only, not physical devices; so gasomet'''er''', voltmet'''er''').  \n * Words which end in American English end with '''log''', such as ''cata'''log''''', ''dia'''log''''' and ''mono'''log''''' are usually spelt with '''logue''' in Australian English: ''cata'''logue''''', ''dia'''logue''''' and ''mono'''logue''''', however the ''Macquarie Dictionary'' lists the '''log''' spelling as the preferred variant for ''ana'''log'''''. \n * '''Ae''' and '''oe''' are often maintained in words such as '''''oe'''strogen'' and ''p'''ae'''dophilia'', in contrast to the American English practice of using '''e''' alone (as in '''''e'''strogen'' and ''p'''e'''dophilia''). The ''Macquarie Dictionary'' has noted a shift within Australian English towards using '''e''' alone, and now lists some words such as ''encyclop'''e'''dia'' and ''f'''e'''tus'' with the '''e''' spelling as the preferred variant. \n * A double-consonant '''l''' is retained in Australian English when adding suffixes to words ending in ''l'' where the consonant is unstressed, contrary to American English. Therefore, Australian English favours ''cance'''ll'''ed'', ''counse'''ll'''or'', and ''trave'''ll'''ing'' over American ''cance'''l'''ed'', ''counse'''l'''or'' and ''trave'''l'''ing''. \n * Where American English uses a double-consonant '''ll''' in the words ''ski'''ll'''ful'', ''wi'''ll'''ful'', ''enro'''ll''''', ''disti'''ll''''', ''enthra'''ll''''', ''fulfi'''ll''''' and ''insta'''ll'''ment'', Australian English uses a single consonant: ''ski'''l'''ful'', ''wi'''l'''ful'', ''enro'''l''''', ''disti'''l''''', ''enthra'''l''''', ''fulfi'''l''''' and ''insta'''l'''ment''. \n * The American English ''defen'''se''''' and ''offen'''se''''' are spelt ''defen'''ce''''' and ''offen'''ce''''' in Australian English. \n * In contrast with American English, which uses ''pract'''ise''''' and ''lic'''ense''''' for both nouns and verbs, ''pract'''ice''''' and ''licen'''ce''''' are nouns while ''pract'''ise''''' and ''licen'''se''''' are verbs in Australian English. \n \n Examples of individual words where the preferred spelling is listed by the ''Macquarie Dictionary'' as being different from current British spellings include ''pro'''gram''''' (in all contexts) as opposed to ''pro'''gramme''''', ''ana'''log''''' as opposed to ''ana'''logue''''', ''liv'''a'''ble'' as opposed to ''liv'''ea'''ble'', ''gue'''r'''illa'' as opposed to ''gue'''rr'''illa'', ''verand'''ah''''' as opposed to ''verand'''a''''', ''bur'''q'''a'' as opposed to ''bur'''k'''a'', and ''past'''ie''''' (noun) as opposed to ''past'''y'''''. < ref name= \" Macquarie Dictionary 8th Edition \" > \" The Macquarie Dictionary \" , 8th Edition. Macquarie Dictionary Publishers, 2020. < /ref >  Unspaced forms such as ''onto'', ''anytime'', ''alright'' and ''anymore'' are also listed as being equally as acceptable as their spaced counterparts. < ref name= \" Macquarie Dictionary 8th Edition \" > \" The Macquarie Dictionary \" , 8th Edition. Macquarie Dictionary Publishers, 2020. < /ref > \n \n Different spellings have existed throughout Australia's history. What are today regarded as American spellings were popular in Australia throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the Victorian Department of Education endorsing them into the 1970s and ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper until the 1990s. This influence can be seen in the spelling of the [[Australian Labor Party]] and also in some place names such as [[Victor Harbor, South Australia|Victor Harbor]]. The ''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has been attributed with re-establishing the dominance of the British spellings in the 1920s and 1930s. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.paradisec.org.au/blog/2008/01/webster-in-australia/ |title=Endangered Languages and Cultures \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb Webster in Australia |publisher=Paradisec.org.au |date=2008-01-30 |access-date=2017-09-20}} < /ref >  For a short time during the late 20th century, [[Harry Lindgren]]'s 1969 spelling reform proposal ([[SR1|''Spelling Reform 1'' or ''SR1'']]) gained some support in Australia and was adopted by the [[Australian Teachers' Federation]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.englishspellingsociety.org/journals/j2/jimmieson.php|title=Spelling Reform 1 \u2013 And Nothing Else!|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120730222013/http://www.englishspellingsociety.org/journals/j2/jimmieson.php|archive-date=30 July 2012}} < /ref > \n \n ===Punctuation and style=== \n Prominent general [[list of style guides|style guides]] for Australian English include the ''Cambridge Guide to Australian English Usage'', the ''[[Style Manual: For Authors, Editors and Printers]]'', the ''Australian Handbook for Writers and Editors'' and the ''Complete Guide to English Usage for Australian Students''. \n \n Both [[Quotation mark|single and double quotation marks]] are in use, with single quotation marks preferred for use in the first instance, with double quotation marks reserved for quotes of speech within speech. [[Logical punctuation|Logical (as opposed to typesetter's) punctuation]] is preferred for punctuation marks at the end of quotations. For instance, ''Sam said he 'wasn't happy when Jane told David to  \" go away \" '.'' is used in preference to ''Sam said he  \" wasn't happy when Jane told David to 'go away.' \" '' \n \n The DD/MM/YYYY [[Calendar date|date format]] is followed and the 12-hour clock is generally used in everyday life (as opposed to service, police, and airline applications). \n \n With the exception of screen sizes, [[metric system]] units are used in everyday life, having supplanted [[Imperial units]] upon the country's switch to the metric system in the 1970s. \n \n In [[sports betting|betting]], [[Odds#Gambling usage|decimal odds]] are used in favour of fractional odds, used in the United Kingdom, or moneyline odds, used in the United States. \n \n ===Keyboard layout=== \n There are [[British and American keyboards|two major English language keyboard layouts]], the United States layout and the United Kingdom layout. Keyboards and keyboard software for the Australian market universally use the US keyboard layout, which lacks the pound sterling, [[euro]] and [[negation]] symbols and uses a different layout for punctuation symbols than the UK keyboard layout. \n \n ==See also== \n {{Portal|Australia|Language}} \n * ''[[The Australian National Dictionary]]'' \n * [[Australian English vocabulary]]  \n * [[New Zealand English]]  \n * [[South African English]]  \n * [[Zimbabwean English]] \n * [[Falkland Islands English]]  \n * [[Diminutives in Australian English]] \n * [[International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects]] \n * [[Strine]] \n \n ==References== \n ===Citations=== \n {{Reflist}} \n \n ===Works cited=== \n {{refbegin}} \n * {{Citation |last1=Cox |first1=Felicity |last2=Palethorpe |first2=Sallyanne |year=2007 |title = Australian English |journal = Journal of the International Phonetic Association |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages = 341\u2013350 |doi = 10.1017/S0025100307003192 |s2cid=232349884 |url = http://clas.mq.edu.au/felicity/Papers/Illustration_Australian.pdf |doi-access=free }} \n {{refend}} \n \n ==Further reading== \n {{refbegin}} \n * {{cite thesis |last = Korhonen |first = Minna |title = Perspectives on the Americanisation of Australian English: A Sociolinguistic Study of Variation |institution = [[University of Helsinki]] |year=2017 |isbn = 978-951-51-3559-9 |degree = PhD |url = http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-51-3560-5 }} \n * Mitchell, Alexander G.
