It is the rarest [[naturally occurring element]] in the [[Earth's crust]], occurring only as the [[Decay chain|decay product]] of various heavier elements. All of astatine's [[isotope]]s are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a [[half-life]] of 8.1 hours. A sample of the pure element has never been assembled, because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity. \n \n The bulk properties of astatine are not known with certainty. Many of them have been estimated based on the element's position on the [[periodic table]] as a heavier analog of [[iodine]], and a member of the [[halogen]]s (the group of elements including [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], and iodine). However, astatine also falls roughly along the [[dividing line between metals and nonmetals]], and some metallic behavior has also been observed and predicted for it. Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a [[semiconductor]] or possibly a [[metal]]. Chemically, several [[anion]]ic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine, but it also sometimes displays metallic characteristics and shows some similarities to [[silver]]. \n \n The first synthesis of the element was in 1940 by [[Dale R. Corson]], [[Kenneth Ross MacKenzie]], and [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], who named it from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''astatos'' (\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), meaning  \" unstable \" . Four [[isotopes of astatine]] were subsequently found to be naturally occurring, although much less than one gram is present at any given time in the Earth's crust. Neither the most stable isotope astatine-210, nor the medically useful astatine-211, occur naturally; they can only be produced synthetically, usually by bombarding [[bismuth]]-209 with [[alpha particle]]s. \n \n == Characteristics == \n Astatine is an extremely radioactive element; all its isotopes have [[half-life|half-lives]] of 8.1 hours or less, decaying into other astatine isotopes, [[bismuth]], [[polonium]], or [[radon]]. Most of its isotopes are very unstable, with half-lives of one second or less. Of the first 101 elements in the periodic table, only [[francium]] is less stable, and all the astatine isotopes more stable than francium are in any case synthetic and do not occur in nature. < ref name= \" Audi2003 \" > {{NUBASE 2003}} < /ref > \n \n The bulk properties of astatine are not known with any certainty.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|2002|p=795}} Research is limited by its short half-life, which prevents the creation of weighable quantities. < ref name= \" MoreAtIC \" > {{cite book|title=Holleman-Wiberg: Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Academic Press|page=423|editor-first1=N.|editor-last1=Wiberg|year=2001|isbn=978-0-12-352651-9|others=Translation of 101st German edition by M.

The astatine [[Volatilization|volatilizes]] and is condensed in (typically) a [[cold trap]]. Higher temperatures of up to around 850 & nbsp;\u00b0C may increase the yield, at the risk of bismuth contamination from concurrent volatilization. Redistilling the condensate may be required to minimize the presence of bismuth{{sfn|Kugler|Keller|1985|p=97}} (as bismuth can interfere with astatine [[radioactive tracer|labeling reactions]]). The astatine is recovered from the trap using one or more low concentration solvents such as [[sodium hydroxide]], [[methanol]] or [[chloroform]]. Astatine yields of up to around 80% may be achieved. Dry separation is the method most commonly used to produce a chemically useful form of astatine. < ref name= \" Larsen \" > {{cite journal|last1=Larsen|first1=R. H.|last2=Wieland|first2=B.

[[World War II]] delayed research for close to a decade. Results of early experiments indicated that a cancer-selective carrier would need to be developed and it was not until the 1970s that [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]] became available for this purpose. Unlike iodine, astatine shows a tendency to [[dehalogenation|dehalogenate]] from molecular carriers such as these, particularly at [[Orbital hybridisation#sp3|sp < sup > 3 < /sup >  carbon sites]]{{efn|In other words, where carbon's one s [[atomic orbital]] and three p orbitals [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridize]] to give four new orbitals shaped as intermediates between the original s and p orbitals.}} (less so from [[Orbital hybridisation#sp2|sp < sup > 2 < /sup >  sites]]). Given the toxicity of astatine accumulated and retained in the body, this emphasized the need to ensure it remained attached to its host molecule. While astatine carriers that are slowly metabolized can be assessed for their efficacy, more rapidly metabolized carriers remain a significant obstacle to the evaluation of astatine in nuclear medicine. Mitigating the effects of astatine-induced radiolysis of labeling chemistry and carrier molecules is another area requiring further development. A practical application for astatine as a cancer treatment would potentially be suitable for a  \" staggering \"  number of patients; production of astatine in the quantities that would be required remains an issue. < ref name= \" Wilbur \"  / > < ref > {{cite journal |first1=G. |last1=Vaidyanathan |first2=M.
