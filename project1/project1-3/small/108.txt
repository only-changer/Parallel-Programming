For the ground finches, this niche is a diet of seeds, and they have thick bills to facilitate the consumption of these hard materials. < ref name= \" Weiner \"  / >  The ground finches are further specialized to eat seeds of a particular size: the large ground finch (''[[Large ground finch|Geospiza magnirostri]]s'') is the largest species of Darwin's finch and has the thickest beak for breaking open the toughest seeds, the small ground finch (''[[Small ground finch|Geospiza fuliginosa]]'') has a smaller beak for eating smaller seeds, and the medium ground finch (''[[Medium ground finch|Geospiza fortis]]'') has a beak of intermediate size for optimal consumption of intermediately sized seeds (relative to ''G. magnirostris'' and ''G. fuliginosa''). < ref name= \" Weiner \"  / >  There is some overlap: for example, the most robust medium ground finches could have beaks larger than those of the smallest large ground finches. < ref name= \" Weiner \"  / >  Because of this overlap, it can be difficult to tell the species apart by eye, though their songs differ. < ref name= \" Weiner \"  / >  These three species often occur [[sympatry|sympatrically]], and during the rainy season in the Galapagos when food is plentiful, they specialize little and eat the same, easily accessible foods. < ref name= \" Weiner \"  / >  It was not well-understood why their beaks were so adapted until [[Peter and Rosemary Grant]] studied their feeding behavior in the long dry season, and discovered that when food is scarce, the ground finches use their specialized beaks to eat the seeds that they are best suited to eat and thus avoid starvation. < ref name= \" Weiner \"  / > \n \n The other finches in the Galapagos are similarly uniquely adapted for their particular niche. The cactus finches (''[[Geospiza]]'' sp.) have somewhat longer beaks than the ground finches that serve the dual purpose of allowing them to feed on [[Opuntia]] cactus nectar and pollen while these plants are flowering, but on seeds during the rest of the year. < ref name= \" Weiner \"  / >  The warbler-finches (''[[Warbler-finch|Certhidea]]'' sp.) have short, pointed beaks for eating insects. < ref name= \" Weiner \"  / >  The woodpecker finch (''[[Woodpecker finch|Camarhynchus pallidus]]'') has a slender beak which it uses to pick at wood in search of insects; it also uses small sticks to reach insect prey inside the wood, making it one of the few [[tool use by animals|animals that use tools]]. < ref name= \" Weiner \"  / > \n \n The mechanism by which the finches initially diversified is still an area of active research.

For example, all members of the Malawi species flock are [[mouthbrooder|mouth-brooders]], meaning the female keeps her eggs in her mouth until they hatch; in almost all species, the eggs are also fertilized in the female's mouth, and in a few species, the females continue to guard their fry in their mouth after they hatch. < ref name= \" Konings2 \"  / >  Males of most species display predominantly blue coloration when mating. However, a number of particularly divergent species are known from Malawi, including the piscivorous ''[[Nimbochromis livingstonii|Nimbochromis livingtonii]]'', which lies on its side in the substrate until small cichlids, perhaps drawn to its broken white patterning, come to inspect the predator - at which point they are swiftly eaten. < ref name= \" Konings2 \"  / > \n \n ==== Victoria cichlids ==== \n Lake Victoria's cichlids are also a species flock, once composed of some 500 or more species. < ref name= \" Seehausen \"  / >  The deliberate introduction of the Nile Perch (''[[Nile perch|Lates niloticus]]'') in the 1950s proved disastrous for Victoria cichlids, and the collective biomass of the Victoria cichlid species flock has decreased substantially and an unknown number of species have become extinct. < ref name= \" Goldschmidt \" > {{Cite book|title=Darwin's Dreampond: Drama in Lake Victoria|last=Goldschmidt|first=Tijs|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0262071789|location=Cambridge, MA}} < /ref >  However, the original range of morphological and behavioral diversity seen in the lake's cichlid fauna is still mostly present today, if endangered. < ref name= \" Seehausen \"  / >  These again include cichlids specialized for niches across the trophic spectrum, as in Tanganyika and Malawi, but again, there are standouts. Victoria is famously home to many piscivorous cichlid species, some of which feed by sucking the contents out of mouthbrooding females' mouths. < ref name= \" Goldschmidt \"  / >  Victoria's cichlids constitute a far younger radiation than even that of Lake Malawi, with estimates of the age of the flock ranging from 200,000 years to as little as 14,000. < ref name= \" Seehausen \"  / > \n \n === Adaptive radiation in Hawaii === \n [[File:Iiwi_on_native_mint_-_Hakalau_Forest_NWR.jpg|thumb|An \u02bbi\u02bbiwi (''Drepanis coccinea'').

With over 400 species currently recognized, often placed in a single genus (''[[Anolis]]''), they constitute one of the largest radiation events among all lizards. < ref name= \" Losos \" > {{Cite book|title=Lizards in an Evolutionary Tree: Ecology and Adaptive Radiation of Anoles|last=Losos|first=Jonathan|publisher=University of California Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0520255913|location=Oakland, CA}} < /ref >  Anole radiation on the mainland has largely been a process of speciation, and is not adaptive to any great degree, but anoles on each of the [[Greater Antilles]] ([[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Jamaica]]) have adaptively radiated in separate, convergent ways. < ref name= \" Irschick \" > {{cite journal|last1=Irschick|first1=Duncan J.|display-authors=et al|year=1997|title=A comparison of evolutionary radiations in mainland and Caribbean Anolis lizards|journal=Ecology|volume=78|issue=7|pages=2191\u20132203|doi=10.2307/2265955|jstor=2265955}} < /ref >  On each of these islands, anoles have evolved with such a consistent set of morphological adaptations that each species can be assigned to one of six  \" [[Anolis ecomorphs|ecomorphs]] \" : trunk\u2013ground, trunk\u2013crown, grass\u2013bush, crown\u2013giant, twig, and trunk. < ref name= \" Irschick \"  / >  Take, for example, crown\u2013giants from each of these islands: the Cuban ''[[Anolis luteogularis]]'', Hispaniola's ''[[Anolis ricordii]]'', Puerto Rico's ''[[Anolis cuvieri]]'', and Jamaica's ''[[Jamaican giant anole|Anolis garmani]]'' (Cuba and Hispaniola are both home to more than one species of crown\u2013giant). < ref name= \" Losos \"  / >  These anoles are all large, canopy-dwelling species with large heads and large lamellae (scales on the undersides of the fingers and toes that are important for traction in climbing), and yet none of these species are particularly closely related and appear to have evolved these similar traits independently. < ref name= \" Losos \"  / >  The same can be said of the other five ecomorphs across the Caribbean's four largest islands. Much like in the case of the cichlids of the three largest African Great Lakes, each of these islands is home to its own convergent ''Anolis'' adaptive radiation event. \n \n === Other examples === \n Presented above are the most well-documented examples of modern adaptive radiation, but other examples are known. Populations of [[Three-spined stickleback|three-spined sticklebacks]] have repeatedly diverged and evolved into distinct ecotypes < ref > Bell, M. A., and W. E. Aguirre. 2013.

On [[Madagascar]], birds of the family [[Vanga|Vangidae]] are marked by very distinct beak shapes to suit their ecological roles. < ref name= \" Reddy \"  / >  Madagascan [[Mantellidae|mantellid]] frogs have radiated into forms that mirror other tropical frog faunas, with the brightly colored mantellas (''[[Mantella]]'') having evolved convergently with the Neotropical poison dart frogs of [[Poison dart frog|Dendrobatidae]], while the arboreal ''[[Boophis]]'' species are the Madagascan equivalent of [[Hylidae|tree frogs]] and [[glass frog]]s. The [[Pseudoxyrhophiinae|pseudoxyrhophiine]] snakes of Madagascar have evolved into fossorial, arboreal, terrestrial, and semi-aquatic forms that converge with the colubroid faunas in the rest of the world. These Madagascan examples are significantly older than most of the other examples presented here: Madagascar's fauna has been evolving in isolation since the island split from India some 88 million years ago, and the Mantellidae originated around 50 mya. < ref name= \" webcite \"  / > < ref > {{Cite journal |author=Feng |author2=Blackburn |author3=Liang |author4=Hillis |author5=Wake |author6=Cannatella |author7=Zhang |date=2017|title=Phylogenomics reveals rapid, simultaneous diversification of three major clades of Gondwanan frogs at the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary |journal=PNAS|volume=114 |issue=29|pages=5864\u20135870|doi=10.1073/pnas.1704632114 |pmid=28673970 |pmc=5530686 }} < /ref >  Older examples are known: the [[Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event|K-Pg extinction event]], which caused the disappearance of the dinosaurs and most other reptilian megafauna 65 million years ago, is seen as having triggered a global adaptive radiation event that created the mammal diversity that exists today. < ref name= \" Stroud \"  / > \n \n == See also == \n {{Commons category|Adaptive radiation}} \n \n * [[Cambrian explosion]]\u2014the most notable evolutionary radiation event \n * [[Evolutionary radiation]]\u2014a more general term to describe any radiation \n * [[List of adaptive radiated Hawaiian honeycreepers by form]] \n * [[List of adaptive radiated marsupials by form]] \n * [[Nonadaptive radiation]] \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist|refs= \n < ref name= \" Larsen \" > {{Cite book|title=Our Origins: Discovering Physical Anthropology|last=Larsen|first=Clark S.|publisher=Norton|year=2011|edition=2|page=A11}} < /ref > \n < ref name= \" Rubinoff \" > {{Cite journal |author=Haines |author2=Schmitz |author3=Rubinoff|date=2014|title=Ancient diversification of Hyposmocoma moths in Hawaii|journal=Nature Communications|volume=5|pages=3502|doi=10.1038/ncomms4502|pmid=24651317 |doi-access=free}} < /ref > \n < ref name= \" Reding \" > {{cite journal|last1=Reding|first1=DM|last2=Foster|first2=JT|last3=James|first3=HF|last4=Pratt|first4=HD|last5=Fleisher|first5=RC|date=2009|title=Convergent evolution of 'creepers' in the Hawaiian honeycreeper radiation|journal=[[Biology Letters]]|volume=5|issue=2|pages=221\u2013224|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2008.0589|pmc=2665804|pmid=19087923}} < /ref > \n < ref name= \" Reddy \" > {{Cite journal |author=Reddy |author2=Driskell |author3=Rabosky |author4=Hackett |author5=Schulenberg|date=2012|title=Diversification and the adaptive radiation of the vangas of Madagascar|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|volume=279:1735|issue=1735 |pages=2062\u20132071|doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.2380 |pmid=22217720 |pmc=3311898 }} < /ref > \n < ref name= \" webcite \" > {{Cite web|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/091001_madagascar|title=Where did all of Madagascar's species come from?|date=October 2009|website=WebCite|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5xIlRolGu?url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/091001_madagascar|archive-date=2011-03-19|url-status=dead|access-date=June 3, 2018}} < /ref > \n }} \n \n ==Further reading== \n * Wilson, E. et al.
