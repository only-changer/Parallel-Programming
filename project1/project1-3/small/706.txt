The mathematician [[Archimedes]] used the tools of [[Euclidean geometry]] to show that the area inside a circle is equal to that of a [[right triangle]] whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius, in his book ''[[Measurement of a Circle]]''. (The circumference is 2{{pi}}''r'', and the area of a triangle is half the base times the height, yielding the area {{pi}}''r'' < sup > 2 < /sup >  for the disk.) Archimedes approximated the value of \u03c0 (and hence the area of a unit-radius circle) with [[Area of a disk#Archimedes' doubling method|his doubling method]], in which he inscribed a regular triangle in a circle and noted its area, then doubled the number of sides to give a regular [[hexagon]], then repeatedly doubled the number of sides as the polygon's area got closer and closer to that of the circle (and did the same with [[circumscribed polygon]]s). \n \n Swiss scientist [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in 1761 proved that [[pi|\u03c0]], the ratio of a circle's area to its squared radius, is [[irrational number|irrational]], meaning it is not equal to the quotient of any two whole numbers. < ref name=Arndt > {{cite book| last1=Arndt |first1=J\u00f6rg |last2=Haene l|first2=Christoph |title=Pi Unleashed| publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2006| isbn=978-3-540-66572-4  < !--isbn only volume 1-- >  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QwwcmweJCDQC |access-date=2013-06-05}} English translation by Catriona and David Lischka. < /ref >  In 1794 French mathematician [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] proved that \u03c0 < sup > 2 < /sup >  is irrational; this also proves that \u03c0 is irrational. < ref > {{citation|first=Howard|last=Eves|title=An Introduction to the History of Mathematics|edition=6th|year=1990|publisher=Saunders|isbn=978-0-03-029558-4|page=121}} < /ref >  In 1882, German mathematician [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] proved that \u03c0 is [[transcendental number|transcendental]] (not the solution of any [[polynomial equation]] with rational coefficients), confirming a conjecture made by both [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] and Euler. < ref name=Arndt/ > {{rp|p. 196}} \n \n ===Triangle area=== \n \n [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron (or Hero) of Alexandria]] found what is known as [[Heron's formula]] for the area of a triangle in terms of its sides, and a proof can be found in his book, ''Metrica'', written around 60 CE.

It was published in 1247 in ''Shushu Jiuzhang'' ( \" [[Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections]] \" ), written by [[Qin Jiushao]]. \n \n ===Quadrilateral area=== \n \n In the 7th century CE, [[Brahmagupta]] developed a formula, now known as [[Brahmagupta's formula]], for the area of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]] (a [[quadrilateral]] [[inscribed figure|inscribed]] in a circle) in terms of its sides. In 1842 the German mathematicians [[Carl Anton Bretschneider]] and [[Karl Georg Christian von Staudt]] independently found a formula, known as [[Bretschneider's formula]], for the area of any quadrilateral. \n \n ===General polygon area=== \n \n The development of [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] in the 17th century allowed the development of the [[Shoelace formula|surveyor's formula]] for the area of any polygon with known [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] locations by [[Gauss]] in the 19th century. \n \n ===Areas determined using calculus=== \n \n The development of [[integral calculus]] in the late 17th century provided tools that could subsequently be used for computing more complicated areas, such as the area of an [[ellipse#Area|ellipse]] and the [[surface area]]s of various curved three-dimensional objects. \n \n ==Area formulas== \n \n ===Polygon formulas=== \n {{Main article|Polygon#Area and centroid}} \n \n For a non-self-intersecting ([[simple polygon|simple]]) polygon, the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]]  < math > (x_i,  y_i) < /math >  (''i''=0, 1, ..., ''n''-1) of whose ''n'' [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] are known, the area is given by the [[shoelace formula|surveyor's formula]]: < ref > {{cite web \n  |url         = http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sys502/extra_materials/Polygon%20Area%20and%20Centroid.pdf \n  |title       = Calculating The Area And Centroid Of A Polygon \n  |last        = Bourke \n  |first       = Paul \n  |date        = July 1988 \n  |access-date  = 6 Feb 2013 \n  |url-status     = live \n  |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120916104133/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sys502/extra_materials/Polygon%20Area%20and%20Centroid.pdf \n  |archive-date = 2012-09-16 \n }} \n < /ref > \n \n : < math > A = \\frac{1}{2} \\Biggl\\vert \\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1}( x_i y_{i + 1} - x_{i + 1} y_i) \\Biggr\\vert < /math > \n \n where when ''i''=''n''-1, then ''i''+1 is expressed as [[modular arithmetic|modulus]] ''n'' and so refers to 0. \n \n ====Rectangles==== \n [[File:RectangleLengthWidth.svg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A rectangle with length and width labelled|The area of this rectangle is & nbsp;{{mvar|lw}}.]] \n The most basic area formula is the formula for the area of a [[rectangle]].

Given a circle of radius {{math|''r''}}, it is possible to partition the circle into [[Circular sector|sectors]], as shown in the figure to the right.  Each sector is approximately triangular in shape, and the sectors can be rearranged to form an approximate parallelogram.  The height of this parallelogram is {{math|''r''}}, and the width is half the [[circumference]] of the circle, or {{math|\u03c0''r''}}.  Thus, the total area of the circle is {{math|\u03c0''r'' < sup > 2 < /sup > }}: < ref name=AF/ > \n :{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} \u03c0''r'' < sup > 2 < /sup > }}  & nbsp;(circle). \n Though the dissection used in this formula is only approximate, the error becomes smaller and smaller as the circle is partitioned into more and more sectors.  The [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the areas of the approximate parallelograms is exactly {{math|\u03c0''r'' < sup > 2 < /sup > }}, which is the area of the circle. < ref name=Surveyor/ > \n \n This argument is actually a simple application of the ideas of [[calculus]].  In ancient times, the [[method of exhaustion]] was used in a similar way to find the area of the circle, and this method is now recognized as a precursor to [[integral calculus]].  Using modern methods, the area of a circle can be computed using a [[definite integral]]: \n : < math > A \\;=\\;2\\int_{-r}^r \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\\,dx \\;=\\; \\pi r^2. < /math > \n \n ====Ellipses==== \n {{main article|Ellipse#Area}} \n The formula for the area enclosed by an [[ellipse]] is related to the formula of a circle; for an ellipse with [[semi-major axis|semi-major]] and [[semi-minor axis|semi-minor]] axes {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} the formula is: < ref name=AF/ > \n : < math > A = \\pi xy . < /math > \n \n ====Surface area==== \n {{main article|Surface area}} \n [[File:Archimedes sphere and cylinder.svg|right|thumb|alt=A blue sphere inside a cylinder of the same height and radius|[[Archimedes]] showed that the surface area of a [[sphere]] is exactly four times the area of a flat [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] of the same radius, and the volume enclosed by the sphere is exactly 2/3 of the volume of a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same height and radius.]] \n Most basic formulas for [[surface area]] can be obtained by cutting surfaces and flattening them out.  For example, if the side surface of a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] (or any [[prism (geometry)|prism]]) is cut lengthwise, the surface can be flattened out into a rectangle.  Similarly, if a cut is made along the side of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]], the side surface can be flattened out into a sector of a circle, and the resulting area computed. \n \n The formula for the surface area of a [[sphere]] is more difficult to derive: because a sphere has nonzero [[Gaussian curvature]], it cannot be flattened out.  The formula for the surface area of a sphere was first obtained by [[Archimedes]] in his work ''[[On the Sphere and Cylinder]]''.  The formula is: < ref name=MathWorldSurfaceArea/ > \n :{{math|''A'' {{=}} 4''\u03c0r'' < sup > 2 < /sup > }}  & nbsp;(sphere),  \n where {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the sphere.  As with the formula for the area of a circle, any derivation of this formula inherently uses methods similar to [[calculus]]. \n \n ===General formulas=== \n \n ====Areas of 2-dimensional figures==== \n [[File:Triangle_GeometryArea.svg|thumb|Triangle area  < math > A=\\tfrac{b\\cdot h}{2} < /math > ]] \n * A [[triangle]]:  < math > \\tfrac12Bh < /math >  (where ''B'' is any side, and ''h'' is the distance from the line on which ''B'' lies to the other vertex of the triangle). This formula can be used if the height ''h'' is known. If the lengths of the three sides are known then ''[[Heron's formula]]'' can be used:  < math > \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} < /math >  where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are the sides of the triangle, and  < math > s = \\tfrac12(a + b + c) < /math >  is half of its perimeter. < ref name=AF/ >  If an angle and its two included sides are given, the area is  < math > \\tfrac12 a b \\sin(C) < /math >  where {{math|''C''}} is the given angle and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are its included sides. < ref name=AF/ >  If the triangle is graphed on a coordinate plane, a matrix can be used and is simplified to the absolute value of  < math > \\tfrac12(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + x_3 y_1 - x_2 y_1 - x_3 y_2 - x_1 y_3) < /math > . This formula is also known as the [[shoelace formula]] and is an easy way to solve for the area of a coordinate triangle by substituting the 3 points ''(x < sub > 1 < /sub > ,y < sub > 1 < /sub > )'', ''(x < sub > 2 < /sub > ,y < sub > 2 < /sub > )'', and ''(x < sub > 3 < /sub > ,y < sub > 3 < /sub > )''. The shoelace formula can also be used to find the areas of other polygons when their vertices are known. Another approach for a coordinate triangle is to use [[calculus]] to find the area. \n * A [[simple polygon]] constructed on a grid of equal-distanced points (i.e., points with [[integer]] coordinates) such that all the polygon's vertices are grid points:  < math > i + \\frac{b}{2} - 1 < /math > , where ''i'' is the number of grid points inside the polygon and ''b'' is the number of boundary points.

Thus a circle has the largest area of any closed figure with a given perimeter. \n \n At the other extreme, a figure with given perimeter ''L'' could have an arbitrarily small area, as illustrated by a [[rhombus]] that is  \" tipped over \"  arbitrarily far so that two of its [[angle]]s are arbitrarily close to 0\u00b0 and the other two are arbitrarily close to 180\u00b0. \n \n For a circle, the ratio of the area to the [[circumference]] (the term for the perimeter of a circle) equals half the [[radius]] ''r''. This can be seen from the area formula ''\u03c0r'' < sup > 2 < /sup >  and the circumference formula 2''\u03c0r''. \n \n The area of a [[regular polygon]] is half its perimeter times the [[apothem]] (where the apothem is the distance from the center to the nearest point on any side). \n \n ===Fractals=== \n \n Doubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). But if the one-dimensional lengths of a  [[fractal]] drawn in two dimensions are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power of two that is not necessarily an integer. This power is called the [[fractal dimension]] of the fractal. \n < ref name= \" Mandelbrot1983 \" > \n {{cite book \n  |last        = Mandelbrot \n  |first       = Beno\u00eet B. \n  |title       = The fractal geometry of nature  < !--Isn't valid anymore: https://books.google.com/books?id=0R2LkE3N7-oC-- > \n  |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=JFX9mQEACAAJ \n  |access-date  = 1 February 2012 \n  |year        = 1983 \n  |publisher   = Macmillan \n  |isbn        = 978-0-7167-1186-5 \n  |url-status     = live \n  |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170320115652/https://books.google.com/books?id=JFX9mQEACAAJ \n  |archive-date = 20 March 2017 \n }} < /ref > \n \n ==Area bisectors== \n {{Main article|Bisection#Area bisectors and perimeter bisectors}} \n \n There are an infinitude of lines that bisect the area of a triangle.
