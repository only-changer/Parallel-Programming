In 1982 a first separation of powers took place when instituting the Govern d'Andorra, under the name of Executive Board (Consell Executiu), chaired by the first prime minister [[\u00d2scar Ribas Reig]] with the approval of the Co-Princes. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.elnacional.cat/ca/efemerides/marc-pons-andorra-primer-cap-govern_227061_102.html|title=Andorra tria el primer cap de govern de la seva hist\u00f2ria|website=ElNacional.cat|access-date=1 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506122057/https://www.elnacional.cat/ca/efemerides/marc-pons-andorra-primer-cap-govern_227061_102.html|archive-date=6 May 2019|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  In 1989 the Principality signed an agreement with the [[European Economic Community]] to regularize trade relations. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:21990A1231(02)|title=EUR-Lex - 21990A1231(02) - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}} < /ref > \n \n Its political system was modernized in 1993 after the [[Andorran constitutional referendum, 1993|Andorran constitutional referendum]], when the [[Constitution of Andorra|constitution]] was drafted by the Co-Princes and the General Council and approved on 14 March < ref name=NS > [[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D.]]  &  St\u00f6ver, P.

This peculiarity makes the president of France, in his capacity as [[prince of Andorra]], an elected monarch, although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the [[List of heads of government of Andorra|head of government]] is the [[head of government|chief executive]], and of a [[wikt:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system. \n \n The current head of government is [[Xavier Espot Zamora]] of the [[Democrats for Andorra]] (DA). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament. \n \n The Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 councillors. The councillors serve for four-year terms, and elections are held between the 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council. \n \n Half are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes, and the other half of the councillors are elected in a single national constituency. Fifteen days after the election, the councillors hold their inauguration. During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected. Eight days later, the Council convenes once more. During this session the head of government is chosen from among the councillors. \n \n [[File:Casa de la Vall - 18.jpg|thumb|Casa de la Vall, the historical and ceremonial Andorran Parliament]] \n \n Candidates can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the councillors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be head of government. The Syndic General then notifies the co-princes, who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the head of government of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the council as Private Members' Bills by three of the local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra. \n \n [[File:Casa de la Vall, Andorra la Vieja, Andorra, 2013-12-30, DD 03.JPG|thumb|left|The [[New Parliament of Andorra]], headquarters of the [[General Council of Andorra|General Council]] since 2011, next to [[Casa de la Vall]]]] \n \n The council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-Princes so that they may sign and enact it. \n \n [[File:Els 7 poetes, Casa de la Vall, Consell General.JPG|thumb|The centre of government in [[Andorra la Vella]]]] \n \n If the head of government is not satisfied with the council, he may request that the co-princes dissolve the council and order new elections. In turn, the councillors have the power to remove the head of government from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the councillors, the council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the head of government is removed. \n \n ==Law and criminal justice== \n {{Main|Law of Andorra}} \n The judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court. The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the head of government, one each by the co-princes, one by the Syndic General, and one by the judges and magistrates. It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms. \n \n The magistrates and judges are appointed by the High Court, as is the president of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the co-princes and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over by one of the judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court. \n \n ==Foreign relations, defence, and security== \n {{Main|Foreign relations of Andorra}} \n [[File:Bruxelles rue de la Montagne 10.jpg|thumb|The embassy of Andorra in [[Brussels]]]] \n Andorra does not have its own armed forces, < ref name= \" cia \" / >  although there is a small ceremonial army.

Being a [[landlocked country]], Andorra has no navy. \n \n Before World War I, Andorra maintained an armed force of about 600 part-time militiamen under the supervision of a Captain (Capit\u00e0 or Cap de Sometent) and a Lieutenant (Desener or Lloctinent del Capit\u00e0). This body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by two officials (veguers) appointed by France and the Bishop of Urgell. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.policia.ad/historia.html|title=Cos de Policia - Hist\u00f2ria i identitat|website=Policia.ad|access-date=26 March 2019}} < /ref > \n \n In the modern era, the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties.

Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter and it is slightly cooler in summer. The diversity of landmarks, the different orientation of the valleys and the irregularity relief typical of the [[Mediterranean climate]]s make the country have a great diversity of [[microclimate]]s that hinder the general dominance of the [[Mountain climate|high mountain climate]]. The great differences of altitude in the minimum and maximum points, together with the influence of a Mediterranean climate, develop the climate of the Andorran Pyrenees. \n \n When in precipitation, a global model characterized by convective and abundant rains can be defined during spring and summer, which can last until autumn (May, June and August are usually the rainiest months); In winter, however, it is less rainy, except in the highlands, subject to the influence of fronts from the [[Atlantic Europe|Atlantic]], which explains the great amount of snowfall in the Andorran mountains. The temperature regime is characterized, broadly, by a temperate summer and a long and cold winter; in accordance with the mountainous condition of the Principality. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://es.weatherspark.com/y/46004/Clima-promedio-en-Andorra-la-Vella-Andorra-durante-todo-el-a%C3%B1o|title=Clima promedio en Andorra la Vella, Andorra, durante todo el a\u00f1o - Weather Spark|website=es.weatherspark.com|access-date=26 March 2019|archive-date=6 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506122054/https://es.weatherspark.com/y/46004/Clima-promedio-en-Andorra-la-Vella-Andorra-durante-todo-el-a%C3%B1o|url-status=dead}} < /ref > \n \n < gallery class= \" center \"  mode= \" packed \" > \n File:Andorra Mountains.JPG|View of [[Ordino|Tristaina]] \n File:Pont d'Any\u00f3s.jpg|[[Gran Valira|Valira del Nord]] river \n File:Carretera de Grau Roig - Encamp - Andorre 1.jpeg|View of [[Grau Roig]] and [[Gran Valira|Valira d'Orient]] river \n File:Valls del Comapedrosa (la Massana) - 9.jpg|View of the [[Coma Pedrosa]] valleys \n File:Pas de la Case panorama.jpg|View of [[Pas de la Casa]] \n < /gallery > \n \n ==Economy== \n {{Main|Economy of Andorra}} \n [[File:Tree map export 2009 Andorra.jpeg|thumb|Exports in 2009]] \n [[File:Grandvalira ski resort, Andorra5.jpg|thumb|right|Scenery of the Andorran mountains at the Grand Valira ski resort, [[Soldeu]]]] \n Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP.
