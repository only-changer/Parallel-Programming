A scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an '''acoustician''' while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an [[Acoustical engineering|acoustical engineer]]. The application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and [[noise control]] industries. \n \n [[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world and [[speech]] is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture. Accordingly, the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human society\u2014music, medicine, architecture, industrial production, warfare and more. Likewise, animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or marking territories. Art, craft, science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole, as in many other fields of knowledge. [[Robert Bruce Lindsay]]'s  \" Wheel of Acoustics \"  is a well accepted overview of the various fields in acoustics. < ref > {{citation|title=What is acoustics?|url=https://acoustics.byu.edu/what-is|website=Acoustical Research Group|archive-url=|publisher=Brigham Young University|access-date=2021-04-16|archive-date=}} < /ref > \n \n == History == \n \n === Etymology === \n The word  \" acoustic \"  is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word \u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (''akoustikos''), meaning  \" of or for hearing, ready to hear \" < ref > Citation error.

He is reputed to have observed that when the lengths of vibrating strings are expressible as ratios of integers (e.g. 2 to 3, 3 to 4), the tones produced will be harmonious, and the smaller the integers the more harmonious the sounds.  For example, a string of a certain length would sound particularly harmonious with a string of twice the length (other factors being equal). In modern parlance, if a string sounds the note C when plucked, a string twice as long will sound a C an octave lower.  In one system of [[musical tuning]], the tones in between are then given by 16:9 for D, 8:5 for E, 3:2 for F, 4:3 for G, 6:5 for A, and 16:15 for B, in ascending order. < ref > C.

Mainly [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564\u20131642) but also [[Marin Mersenne]] (1588\u20131648), independently, discovered the complete [[Mersenne's laws|laws of vibrating strings]] (completing what Pythagoras and Pythagoreans had started 2000 years earlier).  Galileo wrote  \" Waves are produced by the [[vibration]]s of a sonorous body, which spread through the air, bringing to the tympanum of the [[ear]] a stimulus which the mind interprets as sound \" , a remarkable statement that points to the beginnings of physiological and psychological acoustics.  Experimental measurements of the [[speed of sound]] in air were carried out successfully between 1630 and 1680 by a number of investigators, prominently Mersenne.  Meanwhile, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] (1642\u20131727) derived the relationship for wave velocity in solids, a cornerstone of [[physical acoustics]] ([[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]], 1687). \n \n === Age of Enlightenment and onward === \n Substantial progress in acoustics, resting on firmer mathematical and physical concepts, was made during the eighteenth century by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707\u20131783), [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] (1736\u20131813), and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] (1717\u20131783). During this era, continuum physics, or field theory, began to receive a definite mathematical structure. The wave equation emerged in a number of contexts, including the propagation of sound in air. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Acoustics : an introduction to its physical principles and applications|last=Pierce, Allan D.|date=1989|publisher=Acoustical Society of America|isbn=0-88318-612-8|edition=1989|location=Woodbury, N.Y.|oclc=21197318}} < /ref > \n \n In the nineteenth century the major figures of mathematical acoustics were [[Helmholtz]] in Germany, who consolidated the field of physiological acoustics, and [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] in England, who combined the previous knowledge with his own copious contributions to the field in his monumental work ''The Theory of Sound'' (1877).  Also in the 19th century, Wheatstone, Ohm, and Henry developed the analogy between electricity and acoustics. \n \n The twentieth century saw a burgeoning of technological applications of the large body of scientific knowledge that was by then in place. The first such application was [[Wallace Clement Sabine|Sabine]]'s groundbreaking work in architectural acoustics, and many others followed. Underwater acoustics was used for detecting submarines in the first World War.  [[Sound recording]] and the telephone played important roles in a global transformation of society.  Sound measurement and analysis reached new levels of accuracy and sophistication through the use of electronics and computing.  The ultrasonic frequency range enabled wholly new kinds of application in medicine and industry.  New kinds of transducers (generators and receivers of acoustic energy) were invented and put to use. \n \n == Fundamental concepts of acoustics == \n \n {{multiple image \n  | align     = right \n  | direction = horizontal \n  | header    = [[Jay Pritzker Pavilion]] \n  | header_align = left/right/center \n  | header_background = \n  | footer    = At [[Jay Pritzker Pavilion]], a [[LARES]] system is combined with a zoned [[sound reinforcement system]], both suspended on an overhead steel trellis, to synthesize an indoor acoustic environment outdoors. \n  | footer_align = left/right/center \n  | footer_background = \n  | image1    = 20070919 Pritzker Pavilion from stage.JPG \n  | width1    = 178 \n  | image2    = 20070919 Pritzker Pavilion speakers.JPG \n  | width2    = 100 \n }} \n \n === Definition === \n Acoustics is defined by [[ANSI/ASA S1.1-2013]] as  \" (a) Science of [[sound]], including its production, transmission, and effects, including biological and psychological effects. (b) Those qualities of a room that, together, determine its character with respect to auditory effects. \" \n \n The study of acoustics revolves around the generation, propagation and reception of mechanical waves and vibrations. \n \n ::'''[[File:Cause-effect diagram for acoustics.svg|The fundamental acoustical process]]''' \n \n The steps shown in the above diagram can be found in any acoustical event or process. There are many kinds of cause, both natural and volitional. There are many kinds of transduction process that convert energy from some other form into sonic energy, producing a sound wave. There is one fundamental equation that describes sound wave propagation, the [[acoustic wave equation]], but the phenomena that emerge from it are varied and often complex. The wave carries energy throughout the propagating medium. Eventually this energy is transduced again into other forms, in ways that again may be natural and/or volitionally contrived. The final effect may be purely physical or it may reach far into the biological or volitional domains. The five basic steps are found equally well whether we are talking about an [[earthquake]], a submarine using sonar to locate its foe, or a band playing in a rock concert. \n \n The central stage in the acoustical process is wave propagation. This falls within the domain of physical acoustics. In [[fluid]]s, sound propagates primarily as a [[Longitudinal wave|pressure wave]]. In solids, mechanical waves can take many forms including [[longitudinal waves]], [[transverse waves]] and [[surface waves]]. \n \n Acoustics looks first at the pressure levels and frequencies in the sound wave and how the wave interacts with the environment. This interaction can be described as either a [[diffraction]], [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] or a [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] or a mix of the three. If several [[Transmission medium|media]] are present, a [[refraction]] can also occur. Transduction processes are also of special importance to acoustics. \n \n === Wave propagation: pressure levels === \n {{Main|Sound pressure}} \n \n [[Image:Oh No Girl Spectrogram 2.jpg|thumb|[[Spectrogram]] of a young girl saying  \" oh, no \" ]] \n In fluids such as air and water, sound waves propagate as disturbances in the ambient pressure level.  While this disturbance is usually small, it is still noticeable to the human ear.  The smallest sound that a person can hear, known as the [[Absolute threshold of hearing|threshold of hearing]], is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure.  The [[loudness]] of these disturbances is related to the [[sound pressure level]] (SPL) which is measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels. \n \n === Wave propagation: frequency === \n Physicists and acoustic engineers tend to discuss sound pressure levels in terms of frequencies, partly because this is how our [[ears]] interpret sound. What we experience as  \" higher pitched \"  or  \" lower pitched \"  sounds are pressure vibrations having a higher or lower number of cycles per second. In a common technique of acoustic measurement, acoustic signals are sampled in time, and then presented in more meaningful forms such as octave bands or time frequency plots. Both of these popular methods are used to analyze sound and better understand the acoustic phenomenon. \n \n The entire spectrum can be divided into three sections:  audio, ultrasonic, and infrasonic.  The audio range falls between 20 [[Hertz|Hz]] and 20,000 & nbsp;Hz.  This range is important because its frequencies can be detected by the human ear.  This range has a number of applications, including speech communication and music.  The ultrasonic range refers to the very high frequencies: 20,000 & nbsp;Hz and higher.  This range has shorter wavelengths which allow better resolution in imaging technologies.  Medical applications such as [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonography]] and elastography rely on the ultrasonic frequency range.  On the other end of the spectrum, the lowest frequencies are known as the infrasonic range.  These frequencies can be used to study geological phenomena such as earthquakes. \n \n Analytic instruments such as the [[spectrum analyzer]] facilitate visualization and measurement of acoustic signals and their properties.  The [[spectrogram]] produced by such an instrument is a graphical display of the time varying pressure level and frequency profiles which give a specific acoustic signal its defining character. \n \n === Transduction in acoustics === \n [[Image:3.5 Inch Speaker.jpg|thumb|An inexpensive low fidelity 3.5 & nbsp;inch '''driver''', typically found in small radios]] \n A [[transducer]] is a device for converting one form of energy into another.  In an electroacoustic context, this means converting sound energy into electrical energy (or vice versa). Electroacoustic transducers include [[loudspeaker]]s, [[microphone]]s, [[particle velocity]] sensors, [[hydrophone]]s and [[sonar]] projectors. These devices convert a sound wave to or from an electric signal. The most widely used transduction principles are [[electromagnetism]], [[electrostatics]] and [[piezoelectricity]]. \n \n The transducers in most common loudspeakers (e.g. [[woofer]]s and [[tweeter]]s), are electromagnetic  devices that generate waves using a suspended diaphragm driven by an electromagnetic [[voice coil]], sending off pressure waves. [[Electret microphone]]s and [[condenser microphone]]s employ electrostatics\u2014as the sound wave strikes the microphone's diaphragm, it moves and induces a voltage change. The ultrasonic systems used in medical ultrasonography employ piezoelectric transducers. These are made from special ceramics in which mechanical vibrations and electrical fields are interlinked through a property of the material itself. \n \n ==Acoustician== \n \n An acoustician is an expert in the science of sound. < ref > {{cite book|last=Schwarz|first=C|title=Chambers concise dictionary|year=1991}} < /ref > \n \n ===Education=== \n There are many types of acoustician, but they usually have a [[Bachelor's degree]] or higher qualification. Some possess a degree in acoustics, while others enter the discipline via studies in fields such as [[physics]] or [[engineering]]. Much work in acoustics requires a good grounding in [[Mathematics]] and [[science]]. Many acoustic scientists work in research and development. Some conduct basic research to advance our knowledge of the perception (e.g. [[hearing]], [[psychoacoustics]] or [[neurophysiology]]) of [[speech]], [[music]] and [[noise]]. Other acoustic scientists advance understanding of how sound is affected as it moves through environments, e.g. [[underwater acoustics]], architectural acoustics or [[structural acoustics]]. Other areas of work are listed under subdisciplines below. Acoustic scientists work in government, university and private industry laboratories. Many go on to work in [[Acoustical Engineering]].
