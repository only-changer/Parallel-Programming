This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for ''Europe'', as being from Akkadian {{transl|akk|er\u0113bu(m)}} 'to enter' or 'set' (of the sun). \n \n [[T.R. Reid]] supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from ''asu'', meaning 'east' in [[Assyria]]n (''ereb'' for ''Europe'' meaning 'west'). < ref name= \" reid \" / >  The ideas of ''Occidental'' (form [[Latin]] ''occidens'' 'setting') and ''Oriental'' (from Latin ''oriens'' for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with ''Western'' and ''Eastern''. < ref name= \" reid \" / >  Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and [[Eastern world|Eastern civilizations]] on the [[Eurasia]]n continent. < ref name= \" reid \" / >  [[Kazuo Ogura]] and [[Tenshin Okakura]] are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject. < ref name= \" reid \" / > \n \n ===Classical antiquity=== \n [[File:Roman Empire - Asia (125 AD).svg|thumb|The province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] highlighted (in red) within the Roman Empire.]] \n Latin Asia and Greek \u1f08\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 appear to be the same word.

As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek, it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from \u1f08\u03c3\u03af\u03b1, but ancient transitions, due to the lack of literary contexts, are difficult to catch in the act.

The gray area is the later [[Timurid Empire]].]] \n The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian [[steppe]]s. \n \n The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley]] and the [[Yellow River]] shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the [[wheel]]. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands. \n \n The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the [[steppe]]s. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]], who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the [[Tocharians]] resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of [[Siberia]], was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and [[tundra]]. These areas remained very sparsely populated. \n \n The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The [[Caucasus]] and [[Himalaya]] mountains and the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum]] and [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the [[nomad]]s who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies. \n \n The Islamic [[Caliphate]]'s defeats of the Byzantine and Persian empires led to West Asia and southern parts of Central Asia and western parts of South Asia under its control during [[Early Muslim conquests|its conquests]] of the 7th century. The [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion, [[Song dynasty]] reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people. < ref > Ping-ti Ho.  \" An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China \" , in ''\u00c9tudes Song'', Series 1, No 1, (1970). pp. 33\u201353. < /ref > \n \n The [[Black Death]], one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the [[Silk Road]]. < ref > {{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/blackdisease_01.shtml |title=History \u2013 Black Death |publisher=BBC |date=17 February 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605000815/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/blackdisease_01.shtml |archive-date=5 June 2012}} < /ref > \n \n The [[Russian Empire]] began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century.

Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan. \n \n A survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm [[Maplecroft]] identified 16 countries that are extremely [[Climate change vulnerability|vulnerable to climate change]].

[[Call center]]s and [[business process outsourcing]] (BPOs) are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled, English-speaking workers. The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers. Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing. \n \n Trade between Asian countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for Asia. Individual main routes have emerged from this. The main route leads from the Chinese coast south via Hanoi to Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur through the [[Strait of Malacca]] via the Sri Lankan Colombo to the southern tip of India via Mal\u00e9 to East Africa [[Mombasa]], from there to [[Djibouti]], then through the Red Sea over the [[Suez Canal]] into Mediterranean, there via Haifa, Istanbul and [[Athens]] to the upper Adriatic to the northern Italian hub of [[Trieste]] with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe or further to [[Barcelona]] and around Spain and France to the European northern ports. A far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via South Africa to Europe. A particularly significant part of the Asian goods traffic is carried out across the Pacific towards [[Los Angeles]] and [[Long Beach]]. In contrast to the sea routes, the Silk Road via the land route to Europe is on the one hand still under construction and on the other hand is much smaller in terms of scope.
