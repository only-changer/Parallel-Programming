His fragmented, bizarre narrative style influenced later science fiction writers, notably [[Philip K. Dick]]. He was one of the most popular and influential practitioners of science fiction in the mid-twentieth century, the genre's so-called [[Golden Age of Science Fiction|Golden Age]], and one of the most complex. < ref > \" Although [van Vogt] catered for the pulps, he intensified the emotional impact and complexity of the stories they would bear \" . {{cite book | editor= Clute, John | editor-link= John Clute | editor2= Nicholls, Peter | editor2-link= Peter Nicholls (writer) |title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |date= 1995 |publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]] |location= New York |page= 1268 |isbn= 978-0-312-13486-0}} < /ref >  The [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] named him their 14th [[SFWA Grand Master|Grand Master]] in 1995 (presented 1996). < ref name=SFWA/ > \n \n ==Early life== \n Alfred Vogt (both  \" Elton \"  and  \" van \"  were added much later) was born on April 26, 1912 on his grandparents' farm in Edenburg, Manitoba, a tiny (and now defunct) [[Russian Mennonite]] community east of [[Gretna, Manitoba]], Canada in the Mennonite [[West Reserve]].  He was the third of six children born to Heinrich  \" Henry \"  Vogt and Aganetha  \" Agnes \"  Vogt (n\u00e9e Buhr), both of whom were themselves born in Manitoba, but who grew up in heavily immigrant communities.  Until age four, van Vogt and his family spoke only [[Plautdietsch]] at home. < ref name=panshin > Panshin, Alexei [http://www.panshin.com/articles/vanvogt/vanvogt1.html  \" Man Beyond Man. The Early Stories of A. E. van Vogt \"  (page 1)]. Retrieved August 29, 2010. < /ref > \n \n For the first dozen or so years of his life, van Vogt's father, Henry Vogt, a lawyer, moved his family several times within western Canada, alighting successively in [[Neville, Saskatchewan]]; [[Morden, Manitoba]]; and finally [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba.  Alfred Vogt found these moves difficult, later remarking: \n \n {{quote|Childhood was a terrible period for me. I was like a ship without anchor being swept along through darkness in a storm. Again and again I sought shelter, only to be forced out of it by something new. < ref name=panshin/ > }} \n \n By the 1920s, living in Winnipeg, father Henry worked as an agent for a steamship company, but the stock market crash of 1929 proved financially disastrous, and the family could not afford to send Alfred to college.  During his teen years, Alfred worked as a farmhand and a truck driver, and by the age of 19, he was working in [[Ottawa]] for the Canadian census bureau.  He began his writing career with stories in the [[True Confessions (magazine)|true confession]] style of [[pulp magazines]] such as ''[[True Story (magazine)|True Story]]''.  Most of these stories were published anonymously, with the first-person narratives allegedly being written by people (often women) in extraordinary, emotional, and life-changing circumstances. \n \n After a year in Ottawa, he moved back to Winnipeg, where he sold newspaper advertising space and continued to write.  While continuing to pen melodramatic  \" true confessions \"  stories through 1937, he also began writing short radio dramas for local radio station CKY, as well as conducting interviews published in trade magazines.  He added the middle name  \" Elton \"  at some point in the mid-1930s, and at least one confessional story (1937's  \" To Be His Keeper \" ) was sold to the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', who misspelled his name  \" Alfred Alton Bogt \"  in the byline. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.icshi.net/sevagram/stories/keeper.php#top|title=To Be His Keeper by A. E. van Vogt \u2013 Sevagram|website=www.icshi.net}} < /ref >   Shortly thereafter, he added the  \" van \"  to his surname, and from that point forward he used the name  \" A. E. van Vogt \"  both personally and professionally. \n \n ==Career== \n By 1938, van Vogt decided to switch to writing science fiction, a genre he enjoyed reading. < ref > Elliot, Jeffery:  \" An Interview with A. E. Van Vogt \" , ''Science Fiction Review'' #23, 1977. Available online http://www.angelfire.com/art/megathink/vanvogt/vanvogt_interview.html Retrieved on August 29, 2010 < /ref >   He was inspired by the August 1938 issue of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]],'' which he picked up at a newsstand. [[John W. Campbell]]'s novelette  \" [[Who Goes There?]] \"  (later adapted into ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' and ''[[The Thing (1982)|The Thing]]'') inspired van Vogt to write  \" [[Vault of the Beast]] \" , which he submitted to that same magazine. Campbell, who edited ''Astounding'' (and had written the story under a pseudonym), sent van Vogt a rejection letter, but one which encouraged van Vogt to try again. Van Vogt sent another story, entitled  \" [[Black Destroyer]] \" , which was accepted. It featured a fierce, carnivorous [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] stalking the crew of a spaceship, and served as the inspiration for multiple science fiction movies, including ''[[Alien (movie)|Alien]]'' (1979).{{efn|name=movies}} A revised version of  \" Vault of the Beast \"  would be published in 1940. \n \n [[File:Fantasy book 1947 v1 n2.jpg|thumb|right|Van Vogt's  \" Ship of Darkness \"  was the cover story in the second issue of ''Fantasy Book'' in 1948.]] \n \n Also in 1939, still living in Winnipeg, van Vogt married [[Edna Mayne Hull]], a fellow Manitoban.  Hull, who had previously worked as a private secretary, would act as van Vogt's typist, and be credited with writing several SF stories of her own throughout the early 1940s. \n \n The outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939 caused a change in van Vogt's circumstances.  Ineligible for military service due to his poor eyesight, he accepted a clerking job with the Canadian Department of National Defence.  This necessitated a move back to [[Ottawa]], where he and his wife would stay for the next year and a half. \n \n Meanwhile, his writing career continued.   \" Discord in Scarlet \"  was van Vogt's second story to be published, also appearing as the cover story. < ref > [http://www.icshi.net/worlds/voyageof.htm  \" The Voyage of the Space Beagle \" ] (cover images for numerous editions and adaptations of  \" The Black Destroyer \"  and its series).

The novels ''[[The Book of Ptath]]'' and ''[[The Weapon Makers]]'' both appeared in magazines in serial form during this era; they were later published in book form after World War II.  As well, several (though not all) of the stories that were compiled to make up the novels ''[[The Weapon Shops of Isher]]'', ''[[The Mixed Men]]'' and ''[[The War Against the Rull]]'' were also published during this time. \n \n ===California and post-war writing (1944\u20131950)=== \n In November 1944, van Vogt and Hull moved to [[Hollywood]]; van Vogt would spend the rest of his life in California.  He had been using the name  \" A. E. van Vogt \"  in his public life for several years, and as part of the process of obtaining American citizenship in 1945 he finally and formally changed his legal name from Alfred Vogt to Alfred Elton van Vogt.  To his friends in the California science fiction community, he was known as  \" Van \" . \n \n ==Method and themes== \n Van Vogt systematized his writing method, using scenes of 800 words or so where a new complication was added or something resolved. Several of his stories hinge on temporal [[Riddle|conundra]], a favorite theme. He stated that he acquired many of his writing techniques from three books: ''Narrative Technique'' by Thomas Uzzell, ''The Only Two Ways to Write a Story'' by [[John Gallishaw]], and ''Twenty Problems of the Fiction Writer'' by Gallishaw. < ref name=panshin/ >   He also claimed many of his ideas came from dreams; throughout his writing life he arranged to be awakened every 90 & nbsp;minutes during his sleep period so he could write down his dreams. < ref name=platt > [[Charles Platt (science-fiction author)|Platt, Charles]], [http://www.icshi.net/worlds/Plattprofile.htm  \" A. E. van Vogt \u2013 A Profile \" ]. From ''Who Writes Science Fiction?'' (London: Savoy Books, 1980); ''Dream Makers: The Uncommon People Who Write Science Fiction'' (Berkeley Books, 1980). < /ref > \n \n Van Vogt was also always interested in the idea of all-encompassing systems of knowledge (akin to modern [[meta-systems]])\u2014the characters in his very first story used a system called  \" Nexialism \"  to analyze the alien's behavior. Around this time, he became particularly interested in the [[general semantics]] of [[Alfred Korzybski]]. \n \n He subsequently wrote a novel merging these overarching themes, ''[[The World of \u0100]]'', originally serialized in ''Astounding'' in 1945. \u0100 (often rendered as ''Null-A''), or [[non-Aristotelian logic]], refers to the capacity for, and practice of, using [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]], [[inductive reasoning]] (compare [[fuzzy logic]]), rather than reflexive, or conditioned, [[deductive reasoning]].  The novel recounts the adventures of an individual living in an apparent [[Utopia]], where those with superior brainpower make up the ruling class... though all is not as it seems.  A sequel, ''The Players of \u0100'' (later re-titled ''[[The Pawns of Null-A]]'') was serialized in 1948\u201349. \n \n At the same time, in his fiction, van Vogt was consistently sympathetic to [[absolute monarchy]] as a form of government. < ref name= \" DK \" > {{cite book|last=Knight|first=Damon|author-link=Damon Knight|date=1967|title=In Search of Wonder|url=https://archive.org/details/insearchofwonder0000knig|url-access=registration|location=Chicago|publisher=Advent}} < /ref >  This was the case, for instance, in the ''[[The Weapon Shops of Isher|Weapon Shop]]'' series, the ''[[The Mixed Men|Mixed Men]]'' series, and in single stories such as  \" Heir Apparent \"  (1945), whose protagonist was described as a  \" [[benevolent dictator]] \" .  These sympathies were the subject of much critical discussion during van Vogt's career, and afterwards. \n \n Van Vogt published  \" Enchanted Village \"  in the July 1950 issue of ''Other Worlds Science Stories''. It was reprinted in over 20 collections or anthologies, and appeared many times in translation. < ref > http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?56655 Retrieved 10 March 2017 < /ref > \n \n ===Dianetics and fix-ups (1950\u20131961)=== \n In 1950, van Vogt was briefly appointed as head of [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[Dianetics]] operation in California.  Van Vogt had first met Hubbard in 1945, and became interested in his [[Dianetics]] theories, which were published shortly thereafter.  Dianetics was the secular precursor to Hubbard's Church of [[Scientology]]; van Vogt would have no association with Scientology, as he did not approve of its mysticism. \n \n The California Dianetics operation went broke nine months later, but never went bankrupt, due to van Vogt's arrangements with creditors. Very shortly after that, van Vogt and his wife opened their own Dianetics center, partly financed by his writings, until he  \" signed off \"  around 1961.  In practical terms, what this meant was that from 1951 through 1961, van Vogt's focus was on Dianetics, and no new story ideas flowed from his typewriter. \n \n ===Fix-ups=== \n However, during the 1950s, van Vogt retrospectively patched together many of his previously published stories into novels, sometimes creating new interstitial material to help bridge gaps in the narrative.  Van Vogt referred to the resulting books as  \" [[fix-up]]s \" , a term that entered the vocabulary of science-fiction criticism. When the original stories were closely related this was often successful\u2014although some van Vogt fix-ups featured disparate stories thrown together that bore little relation to each other, generally making for a less coherent plot.  One of his best-known (and well-regarded) novels, ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'' (1950) was a fix-up of four short stories including  \" Discord in Scarlet \" ; it was published in at least five European languages by 1955. < ref name=isfdb/ > \n \n Although Van Vogt averaged a new book title every ten months from 1951 to 1961, none of them were new stories; they were all fix-ups, collections of previously published stories, expansions of previously published short stories to novel length, or republications of previous books under new titles\u2014all based on story material written and originally published between 1939 and 1950. Examples include ''[[The Weapon Shops of Isher]]'' (1951), ''[[The Mixed Men]]'' (1952), ''[[The War Against the Rull]]'' (1959), and the two  \" Clane \"  novels, ''[[Empire of the Atom]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Wizard of Linn]]'' (1962), which were inspired (like [[Isaac Asimov|Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series]]) by [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial history]]; specifically, as [[Damon Knight]] wrote, the plot of ''Empire of the Atom'' was  \" lifted almost bodily \"  from that of [[Robert Graves]]' ''[[I, Claudius]]''. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Knight |first1=Damon |author-link1=Damon Knight |title=[[In Search of Wonder]] |edition=2nd  |date=March 1967 |orig-year=First Edition 1956 |publisher=Advent  |isbn=0-911682-15-5 |oclc=489853415 |page=62 |chapter=Cosmic Jerrybuilder: A. E. Van Vogt  |lccn=67-4260 }} < /ref >  (Also, one non-fiction work, ''The Hypnotism Handbook'', appeared in 1956, though it had apparently been written much earlier.) \n \n After more than a decade of running their Dianetics center, Hull and van Vogt closed it in 1961.  Nevertheless, van Vogt maintained his association with the overall organization and was still president of the Californian Association of Dianetic Auditors into the 1980s. < ref name=platt/ > \n \n ==Return to writing and later career (1962\u20131986)== \n Though the constant re-packaging of his older work meant that he had never really been away from the book publishing world, van Vogt had not published any wholly new fiction for almost 12 years when he decided to return to writing in 1962.  He did not return immediately to science fiction, however, but instead wrote the only mainstream, non-sf novel of his career. \n   \n Van Vogt was profoundly affected by revelations of [[totalitarian]] [[police state]]s that emerged after [[World War II]]. Accordingly, he wrote a mainstream novel that he set in [[Communist China (modern)|Communist China]], ''The Violent Man'' (1962); he said that to research this book he had read 100 books about China. Into this book he incorporated his view of  \" the violent male type \" , which he described as a  \" man who had to be right \" , a man who  \" instantly attracts women \"  and who he said were the men who  \" run the world \" . < ref name= \" HLDrake \"  / >   Contemporary reviews were lukewarm at best, < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/aa-van-vogt/the-violent-man/|title=THE VIOLENT MAN by A.A. Van Vogt|via=www.kirkusreviews.com}} < /ref >  and van Vogt thereafter returned to science fiction. \n \n From 1963 through the mid-1980s, van Vogt once again published new material on a regular basis, though fix-ups and reworked material also appeared relatively often.  His later novels included fix-ups such as ''The Beast'' (also known as ''Moonbeast'') (1963), ''[[Rogue Ship]]'' (1965), ''[[Quest for the Future]]'' (1970) and ''[[Supermind (novel)|Supermind]]'' (1977).  He also wrote novels by expanding previously published short stories; works of this type include ''The Darkness on Diamondia'' (1972) and ''Future Glitter'' (also known as ''Tyranopolis''; 1973). \n \n Novels that were written simply as novels, and not serialized magazine pieces or fix-ups, were very rare in van Vogt's oeuvre, but began to appear regularly beginning in the 1970s.  Van Vogt's original novels included ''[[Children of Tomorrow]]'' (1970), ''The Battle of Forever'' (1971) and ''The Anarchistic Colossus'' (1977).  Over the years, many sequels to his classic works were promised, but only one appeared:  ''[[Null-A Three]]'' (1984; originally published in French). Several later books were originally published in Europe, and at least one novel only ever appeared in foreign language editions and was never published in its original English. \n \n ==Final years== \n When the 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' appeared, it was noted that the plot closely matched the plots of both ''[[Black Destroyer]]'' and ''Discord in Scarlet'', both published in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding magazine]]'' in 1939, and then later published in the 1950 book ''[[Voyage of the Space Beagle]]''. Van Vogt sued the production company for [[plagiarism]], and eventually collected an out-of-court settlement of $50,000 from [[20th Century Fox]].{{sfn|Ketterer|1992|p=47}}{{sfn|Decker|2016|p=31}}  \n \n In increasingly frail health, van Vogt published his final short story in 1986. \n \n ==Personal life== \n Van Vogt's first wife, Edna Mayne Hull, died in 1975.  Van Vogt married Lydia Bereginsky in 1979; they remained together until his death. \n \n ==Death== \n On January 26, 2000, A. E. van Vogt died in [[Los Angeles]] from [[Alzheimer's disease]].  He was survived by his second wife, the former Lydia Bereginsky. \n \n ==Critical reception== \n Critical opinion about the quality of van Vogt's work is sharply divided. An early and articulate critic was [[Damon Knight]]. In a 1945 < ref > Van Vogt, A E (1970).

E. van Vogt \" , Knight described van Vogt as  \" no giant; he is a pygmy who has learned to operate an overgrown typewriter \" . Knight described ''The World of Null-A'' as  \" one of the worst allegedly adult science fiction stories ever published \" . Concerning van Vogt's writing, Knight said: \n \n {{quote|In general van Vogt seems to me to fail consistently as a writer in these elementary ways: 1. His plots do not bear examination. 2. His choice of words and his sentence-structure are fumbling and insensitive. 3. He is unable either to visualize a scene or to make a character seem real.}} \n \n About ''[[Empire of the Atom]]'' Knight wrote: \n \n {{quote|If you can only throw your reasoning powers out of gear\u2014something many van Vogt fans find easy to do\u2014you'll enjoy this one.}} \n \n Knight also expressed misgivings about van Vogt's politics. He noted that van Vogt's stories almost invariably present [[absolute monarchy]] in a favorable light. In 1974, Knight retracted some of his criticism after finding out about Vogt's writing down his dreams as a part of his working methods: < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/3/notes3.htm|title=Notes, Reports, and Correspondence: Spring 1974|access-date=March 15, 2016}} < /ref > \n \n {{quote|This explains a good deal about the stories, and suggests that it is really useless to attack them by conventional standards.

Next to this, Doc Smith was an icy realist. There is ''no'' intersection with adult reality at any point, for all van Vogt was able to write was that small boy's sandbox game with an adult level of intensity. This is, I think, the secret of van Vogt's bizarre fascination, as awful as his actual writing might be, and why he appealed so strongly to Philip K. Dick, who managed to put more adult characters and emotions into equally crazy situations.
