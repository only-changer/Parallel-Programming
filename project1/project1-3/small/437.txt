Some authors preferred comparisons to cultures of Asia Minor or even [[Minoan Crete]]. The most obvious historical candidates are [[Lycia]] and [[Scythia]]  &  [[Sarmatia]] in line with the account by [[Herodotus]]. In his [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] (5th century BC) Herodotus claims that the ''Sauromatae'' (predecessors of the [[Sarmatians]]), who ruled the lands between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea, arose from a union of Scythians and Amazons. < ref name= \" CyrinoSafran2015 \" > {{cite book|author1=M.

The Lycians obviously followed [[Matrilineality|matrilineal rules]] of descent, virtue and status. They named themselves along their maternal family line and a child's status was determined by the mother's reputation. This remarkably high esteem of women and legal regulations based on maternal lines, still in effect in the 5th century BC in the Lycian regions that Herodotus had traveled to, lent him the idea that these people were descendants of the mythical Amazons.{{sfn|Herodotus, The Histories|p=1.173.1}} \n \n Modern historiography no longer relies exclusively on textual and artistic material, but also on the vast archaeological evidence of over a thousand nomad graves from steppe territories from the Black Sea all the way to Mongolia. Spectacular discoveries of battle-scarred female skeletons buried with their weapons (bows and arrows, quivers and spears) prove that women warriors were not merely figments of imagination, but the product of the Scythian/Sarmatian horse-centered lifestyle.

Herodotus also explains how it came to be, that some Amazons would eventually be living in [[Scythia]]. A Greek force, that after it had defeated the Amazons in battle at the Thermodon river, sailed home. The fleet included three ships, that were crowded with Amazon prisoners. Once out at sea the Amazon prisoners overwhelmed and killed the small crews of the prisoner ships and, despite not having even basic navigation skills, managed to escape and safely embark at the Scythian shore. As soon as the Amazons had caught enough horses, they easily asserted themselves in the steppe in between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea and, according to Herodotus, would eventually assimilate with the Scythians, whose descendants were the Sauromatae, the predecessors of the [[Sarmatians]].{{sfn|Herodotus, The Histories|p=4.110.1}} < ref name=admay/ > \n \n ===Amazon homeland=== \n \n [[Strabo]] (1st century BC) visits and confirms the original homeland of the Amazons on the plains by the Thermodon river. However, long gone and not seen again during his lifetime, the Amazons had allegedly retreated into the mountains. Strabo, however, added that other authors, among them [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]] claim that after abandoning Themiscyra, the Amazons had chosen to resettle beyond the borders of the [[Gargareans]], an all-male tribe native to the northern foothills of the [[Ceraunian Mountains]]. The Amazons and [[Gargareans]] had for many generations met in secrecy once a year during two months in spring, in order to produce children. These encounters would take place in accordance with ancient tribal customs and collective offers of sacrifices.

This is probably related to the ''[[sagaris]]'', an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also [[Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan]]).

By the sixth century BC, public and privately displayed artwork used the Amazon imagery for pediment reliefs, sarcophagi, mosaics, pottery, jewelry and even monumental sculptures, that adorned important buildings like the [[Parthenon]] in Athens.

Greek and Roman societies, however, utilized the Amazon mythology as a literary and artistic vehicle to unite against a commonly-held enemy. The metaphysical characteristics of Amazons were seen as personifications of both nature and religion. Roman authors like Virgil, Strabo, Pliny the Elder, Curtius, Plutarch, Arrian, and Pausanius advocated the greatness of the state, as Amazon myths served to discuss the creation of origin and identity for the Roman people. However, that changed over time. Amazons in Roman literature and art have many faces, such as the ''Trojan ally, the warrior goddess, the native Latin, the warmongering Celt, the proud Sarmatian, the hedonistic and passionate Thracian warrior queen, the subdued Asian city, and the worthy Roman foe''. < ref > {{cite web |url= https://www.wissenschaft.de/magazin/weitere-themen/auf-den-spuren-penthesileias/    |title= Die Amazonen zwischen Mythos und Realit\u00e4t - Auf den Spuren Penthesileias  |date= August 19, 2010 | publisher= Wissenschaft DE | author= Jochen Fornasier  | access-date= January 17, 2021}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url= https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027 & context=honorstheses  |title= The Amazon in Greek Art |date= March 22, 2012  | publisher= Portland State University | author=Annaliese Elaine Patten     | access-date= February 3, 2021}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |url= https://www.ancient.eu/article/353/roman-interpretations-of-the-amazons-through-liter/  |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190520062034/https://www.ancient.eu/article/353/roman-interpretations-of-the-amazons-through-liter/  |url-status= dead  |archive-date= May 20, 2019  |title= Roman Interpretations of the Amazons through Literature and Art |date= March 22, 2012  | publisher= Ancient EU | author=Erin W.

[[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] of England was associated with Amazon warrior qualities (''the foremost ancient examples of feminism'') during her reign and was indeed depicted as such. Though, as explained in ''Divinia Viagro'' by Winfried Schleiner, Celeste T. Wright has given a detailed account of the bad reputation Amazons had in the Renaissance. She notes that she has not found any Elizabethans comparing the Queen to an Amazon and suggests that they might have hesitated to do so because of the association of Amazons with enfranchisement of women, which was considered contemptible. < ref > {{cite journal |url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/4173965  |title=  \" Divina Virago \" : Queen Elizabeth as an Amazon |date= March 22, 2012  | publisher= Jstor | author=Winfried Schleiner    |journal= Studies in Philology |volume= 75 |issue= 2 |pages= 163\u2013180 |jstor= 4173965 | access-date= February 3, 2021}} < /ref > \n \n [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan Brueghel]] depicted the [[The Battle of the Amazons (Rubens)|Battle of the Amazons]] around 1598, a ''most dramatic baroque painting'', followed by a painting of the [[Rococo]] period by [[Johann Georg Platzer]], also titled ''Battle of the Amazons''. In 19th-century European [[Romanticism]] German artist [[Anselm Feuerbach]] occupied himself with the Amazons as well. His paintings ''engendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.'' < ref > {{cite web|title = German masters of the nineteenth century : paintings and drawings from the Federal Republic of Germany / The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York :: Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications|url = http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/71300|website = libmma.contentdm.oclc.org|access-date = 2015-09-30}} < /ref > \n \n ==Archaeology== \n [[File:Amazone Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2342.jpg|thumb|200px|Amazon in [[Scythia]]n attire, [[Attica|Attic]] vase, {{circa|420 BC}}, [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]], Munich]] \n Speculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological discoveries at [[kurgan]] burial sites in the steppes of southern Ukraine and Russia. The graves of numerous high-ranking [[Scythians|Scythian]] and [[Sarmatian]] warrior women, who might have participated in warfare, led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend has been inspired by the real world. ''About 20% of the warrior graves on the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and lower [[Volga river|Volga]] contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress...'' Armed women accounted for up to 25% of Sarmatian military burials.
