The dictionary definition for angst is a feeling of anxiety, apprehension, or insecurity. < ref name= \" Merriam-Webster \" > {{cite dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/angst |title=Angst |dictionary=Merriam-Webster |access-date=2018-12-12 }} < /ref > \n \n ==Etymology== \n The word ''angst'' was introduced into English from the [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word {{lang|da|angst}} and the [[German language|German]] word {{lang|de|Angst}}. It is attested since the 19th century in English translations of the works of [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]. < ref name= \" Merriam-Webster \" / > < ref > {{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/angst |title=Angst |dictionary=Dictionary.com }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=angst & searchmode=none |title=Angst |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary }} < /ref >  It is used in English to describe an intense feeling of apprehension, anxiety, or inner turmoil. \n \n In other languages (with words from the Latin {{lang|la|pavor}} for  \" fear \"  or  \" panic \" ), < ref > {{cite web |title=pavor, pavoris [m.] C |url=https://www.latin-is-simple.com/en/vocabulary/noun/13344/ |website=Latin Is Simple |access-date=1 February 2021}} < /ref >  the derived words differ in meaning; for example, as in the French {{lang|fr|anxi\u00e9t\u00e9}} and {{lang|fr|peur}}. The word ''angst'' has existed since the 8th century, from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European root]] ''{{PIE|*anghu-}}'',  \" restraint \"  from which [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|angust}} developed. < ref name= \" Collins \" > {{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/angst |title=Angst |publisher=The Free Dictionary }} < /ref >  It is pre-cognate with the Latin {{lang|la|angustia}},  \" tensity, tightness \"  and {{wikt-lang|la|angor}},  \" choking, clogging \" ; compare to the [[Ancient Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|\u1f04\u03b3\u03c7\u03c9}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|\u00e1nkh\u014d}})  \" strangle \" . \n \n == Existentialist angst == \n {{See also|Philosophy of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard#Dread or anxiety}} \n In [[Existentialism|Existentialist]] [[philosophy]], the term ''angst'' carries a specific conceptual meaning. The use of the term was first attributed to [[Denmark|Danish]] [[philosopher]] [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] (1813 & ndash;1855). In ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'' (also known as ''The Concept of Dread'', depending on the translation), Kierkegaard used the word ''Angest'' (in common Danish, ''angst'', meaning  \" dread \"  or  \" anxiety \" ) to describe a profound and deep-seated condition. Where non-human animals are guided solely by [[instinct]], said Kierkegaard, human beings enjoy a freedom of choice that we find both appealing and terrifying. < ref name=Collins / > < ref name=nyt1 > {{cite news|first=Gordon|last=Marino|title=The Danish Doctor of Dread|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/the-danish-doctor-of-dread/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|date=March 17, 2012|access-date=May 18, 2013}} < /ref >  It is the anxiety of understanding of being free when considering undefined possibilities of one's life and the immense responsibility of having the power of choice over them. < ref name=nyt1/ > < ref > {{cite book|last1=Backhouse|first1=Stephen|title=Kierkegaard: A Single Life|date=2016|publisher=HarperCollins Christian Publishing|isbn=9780310520894|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MLTxCgAAQBAJ & pg=PT176|access-date=17 July 2017|language=en}} < /ref >  Kierkegaard's concept of angst reappeared in the works of existentialist [[philosopher]]s who followed, such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and [[Martin Heidegger]], each of whom developed the idea further in individual ways. While Kierkegaard's angst referred mainly to ambiguous feelings about moral freedom within a [[religion|religious personal belief system]], later existentialists discussed conflicts of personal principles, cultural norms, and [[existential despair]]. \n \n == Music == \n Existential angst makes its appearance in classical [[musical composition]] in the early twentieth century as a result of both philosophical developments and as a reflection of the war-torn times. Notable composers whose works are often linked with the concept include [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]] (operas ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' and ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]''), [[Claude-Achille Debussy]] (opera ''[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (opera)|Pelleas et Melisande]]'', ballet ''[[Jeux]]'', other works), [[Jean Sibelius]] (especially the Fourth Symphony), [[Arnold Schoenberg]] ''([[A Survivor from Warsaw]]'', other works), [[Alban Berg]], [[Francis Poulenc]] (opera ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites]]''), [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] (opera ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', symphonies and chamber music), [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] (opera ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'', other works), and [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] (especially ''[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]''). \n   \n Angst began to be discussed in reference to popular music in the mid- to late 1950s amid widespread concerns over [[Cold War|international tensions]] and [[nuclear proliferation]]. [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s book ''[[Bomb Culture]]'' (1968) traced angst in popular culture to [[Hiroshima]]. Dread was expressed in works of [[folk rock]] such as [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[Masters of War]]'' (1963) and ''[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]''. The term often makes an appearance in reference to [[punk rock]], [[grunge]], [[nu metal]], and works of [[emo]] where expressions of [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], [[existential despair]], or [[nihilism]] predominate. \n \n == See also == \n {{div col}} \n *{{annotated link|Anger}} \n *{{annotated link|Byronic hero}} \n *{{annotated link|Emotion}} \n *{{annotated link|Existentialism}} \n *{{annotated link|Kafkaesque}} \n *{{annotated link|Emotion classification#Lists of emotions}} \n *{{annotated link|Death anxiety (psychology)|Fear of death}} \n *{{annotated link|Sehnsucht|''Sehnsucht''}} \n *{{annotated link|Social alienation|Alienation}} \n *{{annotated link|Sturm und Drang|''Sturm und Drang''}} \n *{{annotated link|Terror management theory}} \n *{{annotated link|Weltschmerz|''Weltschmerz''}} \n {{div col end}} \n \n ==References== \n < references / > \n \n ==External links== \n *{{wiktionary-inline}} \n \n {{Emotion-footer}} \n {{S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|state=autocollapse}} \n {{Existentialism}} \n \n [[Category:Anxiety]] \n [[Category:Emotions]] \n [[Category:Existentialist concepts]]"
