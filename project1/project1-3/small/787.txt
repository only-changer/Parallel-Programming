Founded in 1811, Astoria is the oldest city in the state of Oregon and was the first American settlement west of the [[Rocky Mountains]].{{sfn|Lescroart|2009|p=981}} The county is the northwest corner of [[Oregon]], and Astoria is located on the south shore of the [[Columbia River]], where the river flows into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The city is named for [[John Jacob Astor]], an investor and entrepreneur from New York City, whose [[American Fur Company]] founded [[Fort Astoria]] at the site and established a monopoly in the fur trade in the early nineteenth century. Astoria was incorporated by the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] on October 20, 1876. < ref name=incorp / > \n \n The city is served by the deepwater Port of Astoria. Transportation includes the [[Astoria Regional Airport]]. [[U.S. Route 30 in Oregon|U.S. Route 30]] and [[U.S. Route 101 in Oregon|U.S. Route 101]] are the main highways, and the {{convert|4.1|mi|adj=on}} [[Astoria\u2013Megler Bridge]] connects to neighboring [[Washington (state)|Washington]] across the river.
