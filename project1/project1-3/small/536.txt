According to [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]] and [[Plutarch]], in later life he was charged with [[impiety]] and went into exile in [[Lampsacus]]; the charges may have been political, owing to his association with [[Pericles]], if they were not fabricated by later ancient biographers. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Filonik|first=Jakub|date=2013|title=Athenian impiety trials: a reappraisal|journal=Dike|issue=16|pages=26\u201333|doi=10.13130/1128-8221/4290}} < /ref > \n \n Responding to the claims of [[Parmenides]] on the impossibility of change, Anaxagoras described the world as a mixture of primary imperishable ingredients, where material variation was never caused by an absolute presence of a particular ingredient, but rather by its relative preponderance over the other ingredients; in his words,  \" each one is... most manifestly those things of which there are the most in it \" . < ref name=Curd > {{cite book |author=Anaxagoras |editor1-last=Curd|editor1-first=Patricia|title=A Presocratics Reader|publisher=Hackett|isbn=978-1-60384-305-8|chapter=Anaxagoras of Clazomenae|quote=B12|date=2011-03-11}} < /ref >  He introduced the concept of ''[[Nous]]'' ([[Cosmos|Cosmic]] Mind) as an ordering force, which moved and separated out the original mixture, which was [[homogeneous]], or nearly so. \n \n He also gave a number of novel scientific accounts of natural phenomena.

The book contains this passage, explaining how Anaxagoras became influential: \n \n :[According to Anaxagoras] One of the largest things is a hot stone that we call the sun. When Anaxagoras was very young, he predicted that sooner or later a piece of the sun would break off and fall to earth. Twenty years ago, he was proved right. The whole world saw a fragment of the sun fall in a fiery arc through the sky, landing near [[Aegospotami]] in Thrace. When the fiery fragment cooled, it proved to be nothing more than a chunk of brown rock. Overnight Anaxagoras was famous. Today his book is read everywhere. You can buy a secondhand copy in the Agora for a drachma. < ref > Vidal, Gore, ''Creation: restored edition'', chapter 2, Vintage Books (2002) < /ref > \n \n [[William H. Gass]] begins his novel, ''The Tunnel'' (1995), with a quote from Anaxagoras:  \" The descent to hell is the same from every place. \" \n \n He is also mentioned in Seneca's Natural Questions (Book 4B, originally Book 3: On Clouds, Hail, Snow) It reads:  \" Why should I too allow myself the same liberty as Anaxagoras allowed himself? \" \n \n [[Dante Alighieri]] places Anaxagoras in the First Circle of Hell (Limbo) in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', Canto IV, line 137). \n \n Chapter 5 in Book II of [[De Docta Ignorantia]] (1440) by [[Nicholas of Cusa]] is dedicated to the truth of the sentence  \" Each thing is in each thing \"  which he attributes to Anaxagoras. \n \n ==Editions of the fragments== \n {{refbegin}} \n * Curd, Patricia (ed.), ''Anaxagoras of Clazomenae.
