There he died and was buried at the palace he had built. His successor, [[al-Mansur]] ({{Reign|754|775}}), remained in the city until the founding of [[Baghdad]] in 762.{{sfn|Streck|Duri|1960|p=485}}{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|p=66}} The Abbasids also dug the great Nahr Isa canal to the south of the city, which carried water and commerce east to Baghdad.{{sfn|Streck|Duri|1960|p=485}}{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|pp=66\u201367}} Thee Nahr al-Saqlawiyya or Nahr al-Qarma canal, which branches off from the Euphrates to the west of the city, is sometimes erroneously held to be the Nahr Isa, but it is more likely that it is to be identified with the pre-Islamic Nahr al-Rufayl.{{sfn|Streck|Duri|1960|p=485}} \n \n It continued to be a place of much importance throughout the Abbasid period.{{sfn|Peters|1911}} Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] ({{reign|786|809}}) stayed at the town in 799 and in 803.{{sfn|Streck|Duri|1960|p=485}} The town's prosperity was founded on agricultural activities, but also on trade between Iraq and Syria.{{sfn|Streck|Duri|1960|p=485}} The town was still prosperous in the early 9th century, but the [[Anarchy at Samarra|decline of Abbasid authority]] during the later 9th century exposed it to [[Bedouin]] attacks in 882 and 899. In 927, the [[Qarmatians]] under [[Abu Tahir al-Jannabi]] sacked the city, and the devastation was compounded by another Bedouin attack two years later.{{sfn|Streck|Duri|1960|p=485}} The town's decline accelerated after that: while the early 10th-century geographer [[Istakhri]] still calls the town modest but populous, with the ruins of the buildings of as-Saffah still visible, [[Ibn Hawqal]] and [[al-Maqdisi]], who wrote a generation later, attest to its decline, and the diminution of its population.{{sfn|Streck|Duri|1960|p=485}} \n \n The town was sacked again in 1262 by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] under [[Kerboka]].{{sfn|Streck|Duri|1960|p=485}} The [[Ilkhanids]] retained Anbar as an administrative centre, a role it retained until the first half of the 14th century; the Ilkhanid minister [[Shams al-Din Juvayni]] had a canal dug from the city to [[Najaf]], and the city was surrounded by a wall of sun-dried bricks.{{sfn|Streck|Duri|1960|p=485}} \n \n == Ecclesiastical history == \n Anbar used to host an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] community from the fifth century: the town was the seat of a bishopric of the [[Church of the East]].
