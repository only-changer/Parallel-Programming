The senior squad currently competes at [[Torneo de la URBA|Top 12]], the first division of the [[Uni\u00f3n de Rugby de Buenos Aires]] league system. \n \n The club has ties with former [[association football|football]] club [[Alumni Athletic Club|Alumni]] because both were established by [[Buenos Aires English High School]] students. < ref name=unido > [https://www.clarin.com/deportes/polideportivo/historia-alumni-club-respira-rugby-unido-primera-leyenda-futbol-argentino_0_8cB9DpGJl.html La historia de Alumni: un club que respira rugby y est\u00e1 unido a la primera leyenda del f\u00fatbol argentino] by Walter Rai\u00f1o on ''Clar\u00edn'', 26 Nov 2018 < /ref > \n \n ==History== \n ===Background=== \n {{Main|Alumni Athletic Club}} \n The first club with the name  \" Alumni \"  played [[association football]], having been found in 1898 by students of [[Buenos Aires English High School]] (BAEHS) along with director [[Alexander Watson Hutton]]. Originally under the name  \" English High School A.C. \" , the team would be later obliged by the [[Argentine Football Association|Association]] to change its name, therefore  \" Alumni \"  was chosen, following a proposal by Carlos Bowers, a former student of the school. \n \n Alumni was the most successful team during the first years of Argentine football, winning 10 of 14 [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|league championships]] contested. Alumni is still considered the first great football team in the country. < ref name=clarin > [http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/04/24/d-549894.htm  \" En el nombre del f\u00fatbol \" , ''[[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|Clar\u00edn]]'' newspaper, 2003-04-24] < /ref >  Alumni was reorganised in 1908,  \" in order to encourage people to practise all kind of sports, specially football \" . This was the last try to develop itself as a sports club rather than just a football team, such as Lomas, Belgrano and [[Quilmes Atl\u00e9tico Club|Quilmes]] had successfully done in the past, but the efforts were not enough. Alumni played its last game in [[1911 in Argentine football|1911]] and was definitely dissolved on April 24, 1913. \n \n ===Rebirth through rugby=== \n In 1951, two guards of the BAEHS, Daniel Ginhson (also a former player of [[Buenos Aires Football Club (1886)|Buenos Aires F.C.]]) and Guillermo Cubelli, supported by the school's alumni and fathers of the students, they decided to establish a club focused on rugby union exclusively. Former players still alive of [[Alumni Athletic Club|Alumni football club]] and descendants of other players already dead gave their permission to use the name  \" Alumni \" . < ref name=unido/ > \n \n On December 13, in a meeting presided by Carlos Bowers himself (who had proposed the name  \" Alumni \"  to the original football team 50 years before), < ref > [https://web.archive.org/web/20121108143046/http://www.asociacionalumni.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content & view=article & id=6 & Itemid=71  \" Los comienzos de Alumni \"  - club's official website] (Archive, 8 Nov 2012) < /ref >  the club was officially established under the name  \" Asociaci\u00f3n Juvenil Alumni \" , also adopting the same colors as its predecessor. < ref name=unido/ > \n \n The team achieved good results and in 1960 the club presented a team that won the third division of the [[Uni\u00f3n de Rugby de Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires league]], reaching the second division. Since then, Alumni has played at the highest level of Argentine rugby and its rivalry with [[Belgrano Athletic Club]] is one of the fiercest [[Local derby|local derbies]] in [[Buenos Aires]]. Alumni would later climb up to first division winning 5 titles: 4 consecutive between 1989 and 1992, and the other in 2001. \n \n In 2002, Alumni won its first [[Nacional de Clubes]] title, defeating [[Jockey Club de Rosario]] 23\u201321 in the final. \n \n ==Players== \n ===Current roster=== \n As of January 2018: \n {{div col|colwidth=22em}} \n * Federico Lucca \n * Gaspar Baldunciel \n * Guido Cambareri \n * I\u00f1aki Etchegaray \n * Bernardo Quaranta \n * Tobias Moyano \n * Mariano Romanini \n * Santiago Montagner \n * Tomas Passerotti \n * Lucas Frana \n * Luca Sabato \n * Franco Batezzatti \n * Franco Sabato \n * Rafael Desanto \n * Nito Provenzano \n * Tomas Bivort \n * Juan.P Ceraso \n * Santiago Alduncin \n * Juan.P Anderson \n * Lucas Magnasco \n * Joaquin Diaz Luzzi \n * Felipe Martignone \n * Tomas Corneille \n {{div col end}} \n \n ==Honours== \n *'''[[Nacional de Clubes]] (1)''': 2002 \n *'''[[Torneo de la URBA]] (6)''': 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 2001, 2018 \n \n ==See also== \n * [[Buenos Aires English High School]] \n * [[Alumni Athletic Club]] \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist}} \n \n ==External links== \n {{Commons category}} \n * {{Official website}} \n \n {{URBA Top 12}} \n {{Alumni Athletic Club}} \n \n {{DEFAULTSORT:Asociacion Alumni}} \n [[Category:Rugby clubs established in 1951]] \n [[Category:Rugby union clubs in Buenos Aires Province|A]] \n [[Category:1951 establishments in Argentina]]"
