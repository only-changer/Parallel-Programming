  "{{Politics of Angola}} \n Since the adoption of a new [[Constitution of Angola#2010 constitution|constitution in 2010]], the '''politics of Angola''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Angola]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the President, the [[Forms of government|government]] and parliament. < ref > {{cite web|title=Constituent Assembly approves Angolan Constitution|url=http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/politica/2010/0/3/Constituent-Assembly-approves-Angolan-Constitution,7c03e88b-4d2c-425f-bacd-caf923937062.html|website=Angola Press|access-date=4 July 2015}} < /ref > \n \n [[Angola]] changed from a [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Marxist]]-[[Leninist]] system ruled by the [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA), in place since independence in 1975, to a multiparty democracy based on a new constitution adopted in 1992.  That same year the first parliamentary and presidential elections were held. The MPLA won an absolute majority in the parliamentary elections. In the presidential elections, President [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] won the first round election with more than 49% of the vote to [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s 40%. A runoff election would have been necessary, but never took place. The renewal of civil war immediately after the elections, which were considered as fraudulent by UNITA, and the collapse of the [[Lusaka Protocol]], created a split situation. To a certain degree the new democratic institutions worked, notably the [[National Assembly of Angola|National Assembly]], with the active participation of UNITA's and the FNLA's elected MPs  - while Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos continued to exercise his functions without democratic legitimation. However the armed forces of the MPLA (now the official armed forces of the Angolan state) and of UNITA fought each other until the leader of UNITA, Jonas Savimbi, was killed in action in 2002. < ref > From 1998 to 2002, there existed even a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation which included ministers from both FNLA and UNITA. < /ref > \n \n From 2002 to 2010, the system as defined by the [[Constitution of Angola#1992 constitution|constitution of 1992]] functioned in a relatively normal way. The executive branch of the government was composed of the President, the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers, composed of all ministers and vice ministers, met regularly to discuss policy issues. Governors of the 18 provinces were appointed by and served at the pleasure of the president. < ref > {{cite web|title=Angola: Constitution of 1992|url=http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/angola-constitution-1992|website=Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa|access-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704183133/http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/angola-constitution-1992|archive-date=4 July 2015|df=dmy-all}} < /ref >  The Constitutional Law of 1992 established the broad outlines of government structure and the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system was based on Portuguese and customary law but was weak and fragmented. Courts operated in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities. A Supreme Court served as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review was never constituted despite statutory authorization. In practice,  power was more and more concentrated in the hands of the President who, supported by an ever-increasing staff, largely controlled parliament, government, and the judiciary. < ref > http://www.bertensmann-transformation-index.de/bti/laendergutachten/laendergutachten/oestliches-und-suedliches-afrika/angola{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} < /ref > \n \n The 26-year-long civil war has ravaged the country's political and social institutions. The UN estimates of 1.8 million [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs), while generally the accepted figure for war-affected people is 4 million. Daily conditions of life throughout the country and specifically [[Luanda]] (population approximately 6 million) mirror the collapse of administrative infrastructure as well as many social institutions. The ongoing grave economic situation largely prevents any government support for social institutions. Hospitals are without medicines or basic equipment, schools are without books, and public employees often lack the basic supplies for their day-to-day work. \n \n ==Executive branch== \n The 2010 constitution grants the President almost absolute power. Elections for the National assembly are to take place every five years, and the President is automatically the leader of the winning party or coalition. It is for the President to appoint (and dismiss) all of the following: \n * The members of the government (state ministers, ministers, state secretaries and vice-ministers); \n * The members of the Constitutional Court; \n * The members of the Supreme Court; \n * The members of the Court of Auditors; \n * The members of the Military Supreme Court; \n * The Governor and Vice-Governors of the Nacional Angolan Bank; \n * The General-Attorney, the Vice-General-Attorneys and their deputies (as well as the military homologous); \n * The Governors of the provinces; \n * The members of the Republic Council; \n * The members of the National Security Council; \n * The members of the Superior Magistrates Councils; \n * The General Chief of the Armed Forces and his deputy; \n * All other command posts in the military; \n * The Police General Commander, and the 2nd in command; \n * All other command posts in the police; \n * The chiefs and directors of the intelligence and security organs. \n The President is also provided a variety of powers, like defining the policy of the country. Even though it's not up to him/her to make laws (only to promulgate them and make edicts), the President is the leader of the winning party. \n The only  \" relevant \"  post that is not directly appointed by the President is the Vice-President, which is the second in the winning party. < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.angolaembassy.org.il/documents/AngolaConstitution05.02.2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328113805/http://www.angolaembassy.org.il/documents/AngolaConstitution05.02.2010.pdf |archive-date=28 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }} < /ref > \n \n Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos stepped down as President of Angola after 38 years in 2017, being peacefully succeeded by [[Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o]], Santos' chosen successor. < ref > https://www.dw.com/en/who-is-angolas-new-president-joao-lourenco/a-40218458 < /ref > \n \n ==Legislative branch== \n The [[National Assembly of Angola|National Assembly]] (''Assembleia Nacional'') has 223 members, elected for a four-year term, 130 members by [[proportional representation]], 90 members in provincial districts, and 3 members to represent Angolans abroad. The general elections in 1997 were rescheduled for 5 September 2008. The ruling party MPLA won 82% (191 seats in the National Assembly) and the main opposition party won only 10% (16 seats).
