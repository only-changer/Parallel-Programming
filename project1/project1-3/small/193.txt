However, he was not effective against the janissaries who made him sultan. [[\u00c7orlulu Ali Pasha]], who Ahmed brought to the Grand Vizier, tried to help him in administrative matters, made new arrangements for the treasury and Sultan.  He supported Ahmed in his fight with his rivals. \n \n ==Early life and education== \n Sultan Ahmed was born on 30 December 1673. His father was Sultan [[Mehmed IV]], and his mother was [[G\u00fclnu\u015f Sultan]], originally named Evmenia. < ref > {{cite book |author= Baker, Anthony E |title=The Bosphorus |publisher=Redhouse Press |year=1993 |page=146 |isbn=975-413-062-0 |quote= The Valide Sultan was born Evmania Voria, daughter of a Greek priest in a village near Rethymnon on Crete.

During the same ceremony their sisters [[Hatice Sultan (daughter of Mehmed IV)|Hatice Sultan]] and Fatma Sultan were married to Musahip Mustafa Pasha and [[Kara Mustafa Pasha]] respectively.{{sfn|Ulu\u00e7ay|2011|p=110}} The celebrations lasted 20 days.{{sfn|Sakao\u011flu|2015|p=286}} \n \n He grew up in the [[Edirne Palace]]. His schooling began during one of the sporadic visits of the court to Istanbul, following a courtly ceremony called ''bad-i basmala'', which took place on 9 August 1679 in the Istavroz Palace. He was brought up in the imperial harem in Edirne with a traditional princely education, studying the Qur\u2019an, the hadiths (traditions of Prophet Muhammad), and the fundamentals of Islamic sciences, history, poetry and music under the supervision of private tutors.{{sfn|Keskiner|2012|p=47}} One of his tutors was chief mufti [[Feyzullah Efendi]]. < ref > {{cite book|first=Jane|last=Hathaway|title=The Chief Eunuch of the Ottoman Harem: From African Slave to Power-Broker|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=August 30, 2018|pages=133|isbn=978-1-107-10829-5}} < /ref > \n \n Ahmed was apparently curious and intellectual in nature, spending most of his time reading and practising calligraphy. The poems that he wrote manifest his profound knowledge of poetry, history, Islamic theology and philosophy. He was also interested in calligraphy, which he had studied with the leading court calligraphers, primarily with Haf\u0131z \n Osman Efendi (died 1698), who influenced his art immensely, and, therefore, practiced it because of the influence of his elder brother, the future Sultan [[Mustafa II]], who also became a notable calligrapher.{{sfn|Keskiner|2012|p=47}} \n \n During his princehood in Edirne, Ahmed made friends \n with a bright officer-scribe, [[Nev\u015fehirli Damat Ibrahim Pasha|Ibrahim]], from the city of [[Nev\u015fehir]], who was to become one of the outstanding Grand Viziers of his future reign. From 1687, following the deposition of his father, he lived in isolation for sixteen years in the palaces of Edirne and Istanbul. During this period he dedicated  \n himself to calligraphy and intellectual activities.{{sfn|Keskiner|2012|p=47-8}}{{sfn|Sakao\u011flu|2015|p=296}} \n \n == Reign == \n [[File:Een ambassadeur op audi\u00ebntie bij sultan Ahmed III Rijksmuseum SK-A-4080.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|Ahmed III in the Imperial Darbar of Topkapi Palace.]] \n \n ===Accession=== \n {{Main|Edirne event}} \n The Edirne event which held from 19 August to 23 August happened in Edirne, Mustafa was deposed and his brother Ahmed succeeded to the throne on 22 August 1703 and announced his withdrawal of the throne. The first Friday salute was held in Bayezid Mosque. < ref > Sakao\u011flu, Necdet (2015) ''Bu m\u00fclk\u00fcn sultanlar\u0131'' < /ref >  Istanbul, which has been out of control for a long time, was not a peaceful and safe environment.  As the confusions, arrests and executions continued, theft and robbery incidents were common.  {{sfn|Sakao\u011flu|2015|p=297}} \n \n F\u0131nd\u0131kl\u0131l\u0131 Mehmed A\u011fa welcomed the new sultan at the Harem gate on the Hasoda side, entered the arm, brought him to the Cardigan-i Saadet Department and placed them on the throne, and were among the first to pay him. {{sfn|T\u00fcrkal|2013|p=31}} \n \n As part of the fief system renovation programme implemented, he had the land law reorganized in 1705. Due to his support of these new laws, Ahmed was given the title 'law-giver', a title given to three early sultans, [[Bayezid II]] (r.1481-1512), [[Selim I]] (r.1512-1520) and [[Suleyman the Magnificent]] (r.1520-1566). In the first three years of his reign, Ahmed appointed four Grand Viziers, one after the other. However, the government only gained stability after the appointment of [[\u00c7orlulu Ali Pasha]] in May 1706.{{sfn|Keskiner|2012|p=56}} \n \n ===Russo-Turkish War of 1710\u201311=== \n {{Main|Pruth River Campaign}} \n Ahmed III cultivated good relations with France, doubtless in view of [[Imperial Russia|Russia]]'s menacing attitude. He afforded refuge in Ottoman territory to [[Charles XII of Sweden]] (1682\u20131718) after the Swedish defeat at the hands of [[Peter I of Russia]] (1672\u20131725) in the [[Battle of Poltava]] of 1709.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In 1710 Charles XII convinced Sultan Ahmed III to declare war against Russia, and the Ottoman forces under [[Baltac\u0131 Mehmet Pasha]] won a major victory at the [[Pruth River Campaign|Battle of Prut]]. In the aftermath, Russia returned [[Azov]] back to the Ottomans, agreed to demolish the fortress of [[Taganrog]] and others in the area, and to stop interfering in the affairs of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. \n \n Forced against his will into war with Russia, Ahmed III came nearer than any Ottoman sovereign before or since to breaking the power of his northern rival, whose armies his [[grand vizier]] [[Nev\u015fehirli Damat \u0130brahim Pasha]] succeeded in completely surrounding at the Pruth River Campaign in 1711. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  The subsequent Ottoman victories against Russia enabled the Ottoman Empire to advance to Moscow, had the Sultan wished. However, this was halted as a report reached [[Istanbul]] that the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] were invading the Ottoman Empire, causing a period of panic, turning the Sultan's attention away from Russia. \n \n ===Wars with Venice and Austria=== \n [[File:Jean-Baptiste van Mour 006.jpg|thumb|Sultan Ahmed III receives French ambassador Vicomte d'Andrezel at [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]].]] \n [[File:Marquis de Bonnac being received by Sultan Ahmed III.jpg|thumb|French ambassador [[Marquis de Bonnac]] being received by Sultan Ahmed III.]] \n [[File:Ahmet III 1720.jpg|thumb|Sultan Ahmed III at a reception, painted in 1720]] \n On 9 December 1714, war was declared on Venice, and an army under [[Silahdar Damat Ali Pasha]]'s command, {{sfn|Keskiner|2012|p=56}} the Ottomans managed to recover the whole Morea (Peloponnese) from Venice through coordinated operations of the army and navy.{{sfn|\u00c1goston|Masters|2009|p=25}} \n \n This success alarmed Austria and in April 1716, Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] provoked the Porte into a declaration of war. The unsuccessful battle, also  \n commanded by Silahdar Ali Pasha, ended with the treaty of Passarovitz, signed on 21 July 1718, according to which Belgrade, Banat, and little Wallachia were ceded to Austria. This failure was a real disappointment for Ahmed and after the bad conditions imposed by this treaty, Istanbul's economy suffered from increased inflation and all of its attendant evils.{{sfn|Keskiner|2012|p=57}} \n \n Ibrahim Pasha who was the second leading figure of the empire after Ahmed had joined the Morea campaign in 1715, and was appointed as the city of Nish's minister of finance the following year. This post helped him realize the downturn of the state's finances and, due to his insight of this sensitive financial situation he avoided war as much as possible during his vizierate. Ibrahim Pasha's policy of peace suited Ahmed as well since he had no wish to lead any military campaigns, in addition to the fact that his interest in art and culture made him reluctant to leave his Istanbul.{{sfn|Keskiner|2012|p=57}} \n \n ===Character of Ahmed's rule=== \n While shooting competitions were held in Okmeydan\u0131 with the idea of increasing the morale of the soldiers and the people, a new warship was launched in Tersane-i Amir.  He tried three grand viziers at short intervals.  Instead of Hasan Pasha, he appointed Kalaylikoz Ahmed Pasha on 24 September 1704, and Baltac\u0131 Mehmed Pasha on 25 December 1704. {{sfn|Sakao\u011flu|2015|p=297}} It was a great pleasure that the ambassadors of Iran and Austria, who came from 1706 to 1707.  In 1707, the conspiracy led by Ey\u00fcpl\u00fc Ali A\u011fa was unearthed to bring the sultan off the throne.  Necks were cut in front of the Bab-I-H\u00fcmayun . Ahmed III left the finances of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in a flourishing condition, which had remarkably been obtained without excessive taxation or extortion procedures. He was a cultivated [[Patronage|patron]] of literature and art, and it was in his time that the first [[printing press]] authorized to use the Arabic or Turkish languages was set up in Istanbul, operated by [[Ibrahim Muteferrika]] (while the printing press had been introduced to Constantinople in 1480, all works published before 1729 were in Greek, Armenian, or Hebrew). \n \n [[File:Levni 002 detail.jpg|thumb|A [[Portrait miniature|miniature]] of Sultan Ahmed III by [[Abdulcelil Levni|Levni]]]] \n It was in this reign that an important change in the government of the [[Danubian Principalities]] was introduced: previously, the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] had appointed [[Hospodar]]s, usually native [[Moldavia]]n and [[Wallachia]]n [[boyar]]s, to administer those provinces; after the [[Pruth River Campaign|Russian campaign]] of 1711, during which [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] found an ally in [[Moldavia]] [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], the Porte began overtly deputizing [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] [[Greeks]] in that region, and extended the system to [[Wallachia]] after [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Stefan Cantacuzino]] established links with [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Eugene of Savoy]]. The Phanariotes constituted a kind of ''[[Dhimmi]]'' nobility, which supplied the Porte with functionaries in many important departments of the state. \n \n ===Relations with the Mughal Empire=== \n \n ====Jahandar Shah==== \n In the year 1712, the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Jahandar Shah]], the grandson of [[Aurangzeb]] sent gifts to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] Ahmed III and referred to himself as the Ottoman Sultan's devoted admirer. < ref name= \" google \" > {{cite book|title=Mughal-Ottoman relations: a study of political  &  diplomatic relations between Mughal India and the Ottoman Empire, 1556-1748|author =Farooqi, N.R.|date=1989|publisher=Idarah-i Adabiyat-i Delli|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uB1uAAAAMAAJ}} < /ref > \n \n ====Farrukhsiyar==== \n The [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Farrukhsiyar]] a grandson of [[Aurangzeb]], is also known to have sent a letter to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] but this time it was received by the [[Grand Vizier]] [[Nev\u015fehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha]] providing a graphic description of the efforts of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] commander [[Sayyid Brothers|Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha]] against the [[Rajput]] and [[Maratha]] rebellion. < ref > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uB1uAAAAMAAJ & q=Farrukhsiyar |title=Mughal-Ottoman relations: a study of political  &  diplomatic relations ... - Naimur Rahman Farooqi |access-date=2012-04-29|year=1989 |last1=Farooqi |first1=Naimur Rahman }} < /ref > \n \n ===Deposition=== \n {{Main|Patrona Halil}} \n Sultan Ahmed III had become unpopular by reason of the excessive pomp and costly luxury in which he and his principal officers indulged; on 20 September 1730, a mutinous riot of seventeen [[Janissaries]], led by the [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[Patrona Halil]], was aided by the citizens as well as the military until it swelled into an insurrection in front of which the Sultan was forced to give up the throne. \n \n Ahmed voluntarily led his nephew [[Mahmud I]] (1730\u201354) to the seat of sovereignty and paid allegiance to him as Sultan of the Empire. He then retired to the [[Kafes]] previously occupied by Mahmud and died at [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]] after six years of confinement. \n \n ==Architecture== \n Ahmed III built water claps, fountain and park waterfalls. Ahmed, who built three libraries, one inside the Topkap\u0131 Palace, and one of the famous lines of his period.  Ahmed was a master in the writings on plates.  Some plates and inscriptions have survived.  The \u201cBasmala\u201d at the Topkapi Palace apartment door with its plates in the  \n \u00dcsk\u00fcdar Yeni Mosque are among them.{{sfn|Sakao\u011flu|2015|p=307}} \n \n Topkap\u0131 Palace and its buildings have been the subject of many researches and publications.  Among these researches, many different scope studies are also noticed together with postgraduate theses.  Consequently, they provide rich information about the palace, which provides a long list of highly qualified scientific articles and books, guides and brochures promoting the palace and museum.  However, Topkapi Palace and its units still have aspects to be explored and details to be discussed.  Among them Ahmed III library can also be counted. {{sfn|Uysal|2019|p=333}} \n \n A library was built by Ahmed in 1724\u201325 to the right of the porch in front of the tomb.  The structure, which has stone-brick alternate meshed walls, is square-shaped and covered with a flattened dome with an octagonal rim, which is provided with pendants.  There are original pen works left in the pendants and dome of the library. < ref name= \" Cami \" > {{cite web|title=YEN\u0130CAM\u0130 K\u00dcLL\u0130YES\u0130 \u0130stanbul'da XVI. y\u00fczy\u0131l\u0131n sonlar\u0131nda in\u015fas\u0131na ba\u015flanan ve XVII. y\u00fczy\u0131l\u0131n ikinci yar\u0131s\u0131nda tamamlanan k\u00fclliye.|url= https://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/yenicami-kulliyesi|website=\u0130slam Ansiklopedisi|access-date=11 April 2020}} < /ref > \n \n ===Disasters=== \n \n In 1714, an Egyptian galleon standing near the G\u00fcmr\u00fck (Emin\u00f6n\u00fc) Pier caught fire and burned, and two hundred people died.{{sfn|Sakao\u011flu|2015|p=299}} \n \n ====Fire of 1718==== \n While [[Nev\u015fehirli Damat Ibrahim Pasha]] continued his preparations for return to Istanbul, a fire broke out in Istanbul.

The most meaningful element that reflects the cultural aspect or weight of these works until today is the Topkap\u0131 Palace Enderun Library, which was built that year.
