He is perhaps better known for inventing the [[Catadioptric system|catadioptric]] (reflective/refractive) [[Fresnel lens]] and for pioneering the use of  \" stepped \"  lenses to extend the visibility of [[lighthouse]]s, saving countless lives at sea. The simpler [[Dioptrics|dioptric]] (purely refractive) stepped lens, first proposed by [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Count Buffon]]{{hsp}}{{r|chisholm-1911-lighthouse}} and independently reinvented by Fresnel, is used in screen [[magnifying glass|magnifiers]] and in condenser lenses for [[overhead projector]]s. \n \n By expressing [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]]'s principle of secondary waves and [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]]'s principle of [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] in quantitative terms, and supposing that simple colors consist of [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] waves, Fresnel gave the first satisfactory explanation of [[diffraction]] by straight edges, including the first satisfactory wave-based explanation of rectilinear propagation. < ref > Darrigol, 2012, p. & nbsp;205. < /ref >  Part of his argument was a proof that the addition of sinusoidal functions of the same frequency but different [[phase (waves)|phases]] is analogous to the addition of forces with different directions. By further supposing that light waves are purely [[transverse wave|transverse]], Fresnel explained the nature of [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], the mechanism of chromatic polarization, and the [[transmission coefficient|transmission]] and [[reflection coefficient]]s at the interface between two transparent [[isotropy|isotropic]] media. Then, by generalizing the direction-speed-polarization relation for [[calcite]], he accounted for the directions and polarizations of the refracted rays in [[birefringence|doubly-refractive]] crystals of the ''biaxial'' class (those for which Huygens's secondary [[wavefront]]s are not [[axial symmetry|axisymmetric]]). The period between the first publication of his pure-transverse-wave hypothesis, and the submission of his first correct solution to the biaxial problem, was less than a year. \n \n Later, he coined the terms ''[[linear polarization]]'', ''[[circular polarization]]'', and ''[[elliptical polarization]]'', explained how [[optical rotation]] could be understood as a difference in propagation speeds for the two directions of circular polarization, and (by allowing the reflection coefficient to be [[complex number|complex]]) accounted for the change in polarization due to [[total internal reflection]], as exploited in the [[Fresnel rhomb]]. Defenders of the established corpuscular theory could not match his quantitative explanations of so many phenomena on so few assumptions. \n \n Fresnel had a lifelong battle with [[tuberculosis]], to which he succumbed at the age of 39.  Although he did not become a public celebrity in his lifetime, he lived just long enough to receive due recognition from his peers, including (on his deathbed) the [[Rumford Medal]] of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]], and his name is ubiquitous in the modern terminology of optics and waves. After the wave theory of light was subsumed by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] theory in the 1860s, some attention was diverted from the magnitude of Fresnel's contribution. In the period between Fresnel's unification of physical optics and Maxwell's wider unification, a contemporary authority, [[Humphrey Lloyd (physicist)|Humphrey Lloyd]], described Fresnel's transverse-wave theory as  \" the noblest fabric which has ever adorned the domain of physical science, Newton's system of the universe alone excepted. \" {{hsp}}{{r|lloyd-1841}} \n \n == Early life == \n \n [[File:Augustin Fresnel buste Broglie.jpg|thumb|Monument to Augustin Fresnel on the facade of his birthplace at 2 & nbsp;Rue Augustin Fresnel, [[Broglie, Eure|Broglie]] (facing Rue Jean Fran\u00e7ois M\u00e9rim\u00e9e),{{r|martan-2014}} inaugurated on 14 September 1884.{{r|bibmed|academie}} The inscription, when translated, says: < br > \" Augustin Fresnel, engineer of Bridges and Roads, member of the Academy of Sciences, creator of lenticular lighthouses, was born in this house on 10 May 1788.

He became the Permanent Secretary of the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] and (until 1814) a professor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, < ref > Levitt, 2009, p. & nbsp;49. < /ref >  and was the initial point of contact between Augustin and the leading optical physicists of the day {{xref|(see [[#R\u00eaveries|below]])}}. \n \n === Education === \n \n The Fresnel brothers were initially home-schooled by their mother. The sickly Augustin was considered the slow one, not inclined to memorization; < ref > Levitt, 2013, pp. & nbsp;24\u20135; Buchwald, 1989, p. & nbsp;111. < /ref >  but the popular story that he hardly began to read until the age of eight is disputed. < ref > That age was given by Arago in his elegy (Arago, 1857, p. & nbsp;402) and widely propagated (''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 1911; Buchwald, 1989, p. & nbsp;111; Levitt, 2013, p. & nbsp;24; etc.). But the reprint of the elegy at the end of Fresnel's collected works bears a footnote, presumably by L\u00e9onor Fresnel, saying that  \" eight \"  should be  \" five or six \" , and regretting  \" the haste with which we had to collect the notes that were belatedly requested for the biographical part of this speech \"  (Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;3, p. & nbsp;477n). Silliman (1967, p. & nbsp;9n) accepts the correction. < /ref >  At the age of nine or ten he was undistinguished except for his ability to turn tree-branches into toy bows and guns that worked far too well, earning himself the title ''l'homme de g\u00e9nie'' (the man of genius) from his accomplices, and a united crackdown from their elders. < ref > Levitt, 2013, p. & nbsp;25; Arago, 1857, p. & nbsp;402; Boutry, 1948, pp. & nbsp;590\u201391. < /ref > \n \n In 1801, Augustin was sent to the ''\u00c9cole Centrale'' at [[Caen]], as company for Louis. But Augustin lifted his performance: in late 1804 he was accepted into the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, being placed 17th in the entrance examination. < ref > Levitt, 2013, pp. & nbsp;25\u20136; Silliman, 1967, pp. & nbsp;9\u201311. < /ref > {{r|chisholm-1911-fresnel}} As the detailed records of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique begin in 1808, we know little of Augustin's time there, except that he made few if any friends and \u2013 in spite of continuing poor health \u2013 excelled in drawing and geometry: < ref > Boutry, 1948, p. & nbsp;592. < /ref >  in his first year he took a prize for his solution to a geometry problem posed by [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]]. < ref > Silliman, 1967, p. & nbsp;14; Arago, 1857, p. & nbsp;403. Fresnel's solution was printed in the ''Correspondance sur l'\u00c9cole polytechnique'', No. & nbsp;4 (June\u2013July 1805), [https://books.google.com/books?id=IbU-AAAAcAAJ & pg=PA78 pp. & nbsp;78\u201380], and reprinted in Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;2, pp. & nbsp;681\u20134. Boutry (1948, p. & nbsp;591) takes this story as referring to the entrance examination. < /ref >  Graduating in 1806, he then enrolled at the [[\u00c9cole des ponts ParisTech|\u00c9cole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es]] (National School of Bridges and Roads, also known as  \" ENPC \"  or  \" \u00c9cole des Ponts \" ), from which he graduated in 1809, entering the service of the [[Corps of Bridges, Waters and Forests|Corps des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es]] as an ''ing\u00e9nieur ordinaire aspirant'' (ordinary engineer in training). Directly or indirectly, he was to remain in the employment of the  \" Corps des Ponts \"  for the rest of his life. < ref > Levitt, 2013, pp. & nbsp;26\u20137; Silliman, 2008, p. & nbsp;166; Boutry, 1948, pp. & nbsp;592,{{tsp}}601. < /ref > \n \n === Religious formation === \n \n Augustin Fresnel's parents were [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] of the [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] sect, characterized by an extreme [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] view of [[original sin]]. Religion took first place in the boys' home-schooling. In & nbsp;1802, Mme & nbsp;Fresnel reportedly said: \n {{quote|I pray God to give my son the grace to employ the great talents, which he has received, for his own benefit, and for the God of all.

He placed virtue above science and genius. Yet in his last days he needed  \" strength of soul, \"  not against death alone, but against  \" the interruption of discoveries\u2026 of which he hoped to derive useful applications. \" {{hsp}} < ref > Kneller, 1911, pp. & nbsp;148\u20139n; cf. & nbsp;Arago, 1857, p. & nbsp;470. < /ref > \n \n Jansenism is considered [[heresy|heretical]] by the Roman Catholic Church {{xref|(see [[List of Christian heresies]])}}, and may be part of the explanation why Fresnel, in spite of his scientific achievements and his royalist credentials, never gained a permanent academic teaching post; < ref > Grattan-Guinness, 1990, pp. & nbsp;914\u201315. < /ref >  his only teaching appointment was at the [[Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e de Luxembourg|Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e]] in the winter of 1819\u201320.{{r|brock-1909}} < ref > Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;1, p. & nbsp;xcvii. < /ref >  Be that as it may, the brief article on Fresnel in the old ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' does not mention his Jansenism, but describes him as  \" a deeply religious man and remarkable for his keen sense of duty. \" {{hsp}}{{r|brock-1909}} \n \n == Engineering assignments == \n \n Fresnel was initially posted to the western d\u00e9partement of [[Vend\u00e9e]]. There, in 1811, he anticipated what became known as the [[Solvay process]] for producing [[sodium carbonate|soda & nbsp;ash]], except that recycling of the [[ammonia]] was not considered.{{r|reilly-1951}} That difference may explain why leading chemists, who learned of his discovery through his uncle L\u00e9onor, eventually thought it uneconomic. < ref > Cf.{{tsp}} Silliman, 1967, pp. & nbsp;28\u201333; Levitt, 2013, p. & nbsp;29; Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;113\u20134. & nbsp; The surviving correspondence on soda ash extends from August 1811 to April 1812; see Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;2, pp. & nbsp;810\u201317. < /ref > \n \n [[File:028_album_dauphin\u00e9,_Nyons,_Drome,_by_AD_cropped.jpg|thumb|left| < div style= \" text-align: center; \" > Nyons, France, XIXth century, drawn by Alexandre Debelle (1805\u20131897)  < /div > ]] \n \n About 1812, Fresnel was sent to [[Nyons]], in the southern d\u00e9partement of [[Dr\u00f4me]], to assist with the imperial highway that was to connect Spain and Italy. < ref name=silliman-p166 / >  It is from Nyons that we have the first evidence of his interest in optics.

The [[wave theory of light|wave theory]], as developed by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in his ''[[Treatise on Light]]'' (1690), explained rectilinear propagation on the assumption that each point crossed by a traveling wavefront becomes the source of a secondary wavefront. Given the initial position of a traveling wavefront, any later position (according to Huygens) was the common [[tangent]] surface ([[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]]) of the secondary wavefronts emitted from the earlier position. < ref > Huygens, 1690, tr. & nbsp;Thompson, pp. & nbsp;20\u201321. < /ref >  As the extent of the common tangent was limited by the extent of the initial wavefront, the repeated application of Huygens's construction to a plane wavefront of limited extent (in a uniform medium) gave a straight, parallel beam. While this construction indeed predicted rectilinear propagation, it was difficult to reconcile with the common observation that wavefronts on the surface of water can bend around obstructions, and with the similar behavior of [[sound]] waves \u2013 causing Newton to maintain, to the end of his life, that if light consisted of waves it would  \" bend and spread every way \"  into the shadows. < ref > Newton, 1730, p. & nbsp;362. < /ref > \n \n Huygens's theory neatly explained the law of '''[[specular reflection|ordinary reflection]]''' and the law of '''[[Snell's law|ordinary refraction]]''' ( \" Snell's law \" ), provided that the secondary waves traveled slower in denser media (those of higher [[refractive index]]). < ref > Huygens, 1690, tr. & nbsp;Thompson, pp. & nbsp;22\u201338. < /ref >  The corpuscular theory, with the hypothesis that the corpuscles were subject to forces acting perpendicular to surfaces, explained the same laws equally well, < ref > Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;93\u20134,{{tsp}}103. < /ref >  albeit with the implication that light traveled ''faster'' in denser media; that implication was wrong, but could not be directly disproven with the technology of Newton's time or even Fresnel's time {{xref|(see [[Fizeau\u2013Foucault apparatus]])}}. \n \n Similarly inconclusive was '''[[aberration of light|stellar aberration]]'''\u2014that is, the apparent change in the position of a star due to the velocity of the earth across the line of sight (not to be confused with [[stellar parallax]], which is due to the ''displacement'' of the earth across the line of sight). Identified by [[James Bradley]] in 1728, stellar aberration was widely taken as confirmation of the corpuscular theory. But it was equally compatible with the wave theory, as [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] noted in 1746 \u2013 tacitly assuming that the [[luminiferous aether|aether]] (the supposed wave-bearing medium) near the earth was not disturbed by the motion of the earth. < ref > Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;129\u201330,{{tsp}}258. < /ref > \n \n The outstanding strength of Huygens's theory was his explanation of the '''[[birefringence]]''' (double refraction) of  \" [[Iceland spar|Iceland crystal]] \"  (transparent [[calcite]]), on the assumption that the secondary waves are spherical for the ordinary refraction (which satisfies Snell's law) and [[spheroid]]al for the ''extraordinary'' refraction (which does not). < ref > Huygens, 1690, tr. & nbsp;Thompson, pp. & nbsp;52\u2013105. < /ref >  In general, Huygens's common-tangent construction implies that rays are ''paths of least time'' between successive positions of the wavefront, in accordance with [[Fermat's principle]].{{r|deWitte-1959}} < ref > Young, 1855, pp. & nbsp;225\u20136,{{tsp}}229. < /ref >  In the special case of [[isotropy|isotropic]] media, the secondary wavefronts must be spherical, and Huygens's construction then implies that the rays are perpendicular to the wavefront; indeed, the law of ''ordinary'' refraction can be separately derived from that premise, as [[Ignace-Gaston Pardies]] did before Huygens. < ref > Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;62\u20134. < /ref > \n \n [[File:Ggb in soap bubble 3.JPG|thumb|left|Altered colors of skylight reflected in a soap bubble, due to ''[[thin-film interference]]'' (formerly called  \" thin-plate \"  interference)]] \n \n Although Newton rejected the wave theory, he noticed its potential to explain colors, including the colors of  \" [[thin-film interference|'''thin plates''']] \"  (e.g.,  \" [[Newton's rings]] \" , and the colors of skylight reflected in soap bubbles), on the assumption that light consists of ''periodic'' waves, with the lowest [[frequency|frequencies]] (longest [[wavelength]]s) at the red end of the spectrum, and the highest frequencies (shortest wavelengths) at the violet end.

Newton, who called diffraction  \" inflexion \" , supposed that rays of light passing close to obstacles were bent ( \" inflected \" ); but his explanation was only qualitative. < ref > Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;101\u20132; Newton, 1730, Book & nbsp;{{serif|III}}, Part & nbsp;{{serif|I}}. < /ref >  Huygens's common-tangent construction, without modifications, could not accommodate diffraction at all. Two such modifications were proposed by Young in the same 1801 Bakerian Lecture: first, that the secondary waves near the edge of an obstacle could diverge into the shadow, but only weakly, due to limited reinforcement from other secondary waves;{{r|young-1801|p=25\u20137}} and second, that diffraction by an edge was caused by interference between two rays: one reflected off the edge, and the other inflected while passing near the edge. The latter ray would be undeviated if sufficiently far from the edge, but Young did not elaborate on that case.{{r|young-1801|p=42\u20134}} These were the earliest suggestions that the degree of diffraction depends on wavelength. < ref > Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;177\u20139. < /ref >  Later, in the 1803 Bakerian Lecture, Young ceased to regard inflection as a separate phenomenon, < ref > Young, 1855, p. & nbsp;188. < /ref >  and produced evidence that diffraction fringes ''inside'' the shadow of a narrow obstacle were due to interference: when the light from one side was blocked, the internal fringes disappeared. < ref > Young, 1855, pp. & nbsp;179\u201381. < /ref >  But Young was alone in such efforts until Fresnel entered the field. < ref > Darrigol, 2012, p. & nbsp;187. < /ref > \n \n Huygens, in his investigation of double refraction, noticed something that he could not explain: when light passes through two similarly oriented calcite crystals at normal incidence, the ordinary ray emerging from the first crystal suffers only the ordinary refraction in the second, while the extraordinary ray emerging from the first suffers only the extraordinary refraction in the second; but when the second crystal is rotated 90\u00b0 about the incident rays, the roles are interchanged, so that the ordinary ray emerging from the first crystal suffers only the extraordinary refraction in the second, and vice versa. < ref > Huygens, 1690, tr. & nbsp;Thompson, pp. & nbsp;92\u20134. For simplicity, the above text describes a special case; Huygens's description has greater generality. < /ref >  This discovery gave Newton another reason to reject the wave theory: rays of light evidently had  \" sides \" . < ref > Newton, 1730, pp. & nbsp;358\u201361. < /ref >  Corpuscles could have sides{{hsp}} < ref > Newton, 1730, pp. & nbsp;373\u20134. < /ref >  (or ''poles'', as they would later be called); but waves of light could not, < ref > Newton, 1730, p. & nbsp;363. < /ref >  because (so it seemed) any such waves would need to be [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] (with vibrations in the direction of propagation). Newton offered an alternative  \" Rule \"  for the extraordinary refraction, < ref > Newton, 1730, p. & nbsp;356. < /ref >  which rode on his authority through the 18th century, although he made  \" no known attempt to deduce it from any principles of optics, corpuscular or otherwise. \" {{hsp}}{{r|buchwald-1980|p=327}} \n \n [[File:Etienne-Louis Malus.jpg|thumb|left| < div style= \" text-align: center; \" > \u00c9tienne-Louis Malus (1775\u20131812) < /div > ]] \n \n In 1808 the extraordinary refraction of calcite was investigated experimentally, with unprecedented accuracy, by [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Malus]], and found to be consistent with Huygens's spheroid construction, not Newton's  \" Rule \" .{{r|buchwald-1980}} Malus, encouraged by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]],{{r|kipnis-2003|p=1146}} then sought to explain this law in corpuscular terms: from the known relation between the incident and refracted ray directions, Malus derived the corpuscular velocity (as a function of direction) that would satisfy [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]]'s  \" least action \"  principle. But, as Young pointed out, the existence of such a velocity law was guaranteed by Huygens's spheroid, because Huygens's construction leads to Fermat's principle, which becomes Maupertuis's principle if the ray speed is replaced by the reciprocal of the particle speed! The corpuscularists had not found a ''force'' law that would yield the alleged velocity law, except by a circular argument in which a force acting at the ''surface'' of the crystal inexplicably depended on the direction of the (possibly subsequent) velocity ''within'' the crystal. Worse, it was doubtful that any such force would satisfy the conditions of Maupertuis's principle. < ref > Frankel (1974) and Young (1855, pp. & nbsp;225\u20138) debunk Laplace's claim to have established the existence of such a force. Fresnel (1827, tr. & nbsp;Hobson, pp. & nbsp;239\u201341) more comprehensively addresses the mechanical difficulties of this claim. Admittedly, the particular statement that he attributes to Laplace is not found in the relevant passage from Laplace's writings (appended to Fresnel's memoir by the translator), which is similar to the passage previously demolished by Young; however, an equivalent statement ''is'' found in the works of Malus (''M\u00e9moires de Physique et de Chimie, de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Arcueil'', vol. & nbsp;2, 1809, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nl87AAAAcAAJ & pg=PA266 p. & nbsp;266], quoted in translation by Silliman, 1967, p. & nbsp;131). < /ref >  In contrast, Young proceeded to show that  \" a & nbsp;medium more easily compressible in one direction than in any direction perpendicular to it, as if it consisted of an infinite number of parallel plates connected by a substance somewhat less elastic \"  admits spheroidal longitudinal wavefronts, as Huygens supposed. < ref > Young, 1855, pp. & nbsp;228\u201332; cf. & nbsp;Whewell, 1857, p. & nbsp;329. < /ref > \n \n [[File:Calcite and polarizing filter.gif|thumb|300px|Printed label seen through a doubly-refracting calcite crystal and a modern polarizing filter (rotated to show the different polarizations of the two images)]] \n \n But Malus, in the midst of his experiments on double refraction, noticed something else: when a ray of light is reflected off a non-metallic surface at the appropriate angle, it behaves like ''one'' of the two rays emerging from a calcite crystal. < ref > Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;191\u20132; Silliman, 1967, pp. & nbsp;125\u20137. < /ref >  It was Malus who coined the term '''[[polarizer|polarization]]''' to describe this behavior, although the polarizing angle became known as '''[[Brewster's angle]]''' after its dependence on the refractive index was determined experimentally by [[David Brewster]] in 1815.{{r|brewster-1815b}} Malus also introduced the term ''[[plane of polarization]]''. In the case of polarization by reflection, his  \" plane of polarization \"  was the plane of the incident and reflected rays; in modern terms, this is the plane ''normal'' to the ''electric'' vibration. In & nbsp;1809, Malus further discovered that the intensity of light passing through ''two'' polarizers is proportional to the squared cosine of the angle between their planes of polarization ('''[[Malus's law]]'''), < ref > Darrigol, 2012, p. & nbsp;192; Silliman, 1967, p. & nbsp;128. < /ref >  whether the polarizers work by reflection or double refraction, and that ''all'' birefringent crystals produce both extraordinary refraction and polarization. < ref > Young, 1855, pp. & nbsp;249\u201350. < /ref >  As the corpuscularists started trying to explain these things in terms of polar  \" molecules \"  of light, the wave-theorists had ''no working hypothesis'' on the nature of polarization, prompting Young to remark that Malus's observations  \" present greater difficulties to the advocates of the undulatory theory than any other facts with which we are acquainted. \" {{hsp}} < ref > Young, 1855, p. & nbsp;233. < /ref > \n \n Malus died in February 1812, at the age of 36, shortly after receiving the [[Rumford Medal]] for his work on polarization. \n \n In August 1811, [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago]] reported that if a thin plate of [[mica]] was viewed against a white polarized backlight through a calcite crystal, the two images of the mica were of [[complementary colors]] (the overlap having the same color as the background). The light emerging from the mica was  \" ''de''polarized \"  in the sense that there was no orientation of the calcite that made one image disappear; yet it was not ordinary ( \" ''un''polarized \" ) light, for which the two images would be of the same color. Rotating the calcite around the line of sight changed the colors, though they remained complementary. Rotating the mica changed the ''saturation'' (not the hue) of the colors. This phenomenon became known as '''chromatic polarization'''. Replacing the mica with a much thicker plate of [[quartz]], with its faces perpendicular to the optic axis (the axis of Huygens's spheroid or Malus's velocity function), produced a similar effect, except that rotating the quartz made no difference. Arago tried to explain his observations in ''corpuscular'' terms. < ref > Levitt, 2009, p. & nbsp;37; Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;193\u20134,{{tsp}}290. < /ref > \n \n [[File:Arago Francois portrait.jpg|thumb|left| < div style= \" text-align: center; \" > Fran\u00e7ois Arago (1786\u20131853) < /div > ]] \n \n In 1812, as Arago pursued further qualitative experiments and other commitments, [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] reworked the same ground using a [[gypsum]] lamina in place of the mica, and found empirical formulae for the intensities of the ordinary and extraordinary images.

In fact the overlap between Arago's work and Biot's was minimal, Arago's being only qualitative and wider in scope (attempting to include polarization by reflection). But the dispute triggered a notorious falling-out between the two men. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;79\u201388; Levitt, 2009, pp. & nbsp;33\u201354. < /ref > {{r|buchwald-1989b}} < !-- Frankel, 1976, p. & nbsp;156; Darrigol, 2012, p. & nbsp;194; Buchwald, 2013, p. & nbsp;450. -- > \n \n Later that year, Biot tried to explain the observations as an oscillation of the alignment of the  \" affected \"  corpuscles at a frequency proportional to that of Newton's  \" fits \" , due to forces depending on the alignment. This theory became known as ''mobile polarization''. To reconcile his results with a sinusoidal oscillation, Biot had to suppose that the corpuscles emerged with one of two permitted orientations, namely the extremes of the oscillation, with probabilities depending on the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the oscillation. < ref > Frankel, 1976, pp. & nbsp;149\u201350; Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;99\u2013103; Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;195\u20136. < /ref >  Corpuscular optics was becoming expensive on assumptions. But in 1813, Biot reported that the case of quartz was simpler: the observable phenomenon (now called '''[[optical rotation]]''' or ''optical activity'' or sometimes ''rotary polarization'') was a gradual rotation of the polarization direction with distance, and could be explained by a corresponding rotation (''not'' oscillation) of the corpuscles. < ref > Frankel, 1976, pp. & nbsp;151\u20132; Darrigol, 2012, p. & nbsp;196. < /ref > \n \n Early in 1814, reviewing Biot's work on chromatic polarization, Young noted that the periodicity of the color as a function of the plate thickness \u2013 including the factor by which the period exceeded that for a reflective thin plate, and even the effect of obliquity of the plate (but not the role of polarization)\u2014could be explained by the wave theory in terms of the different propagation times of the ordinary and extraordinary waves through the plate. < ref > Young, 1855, pp. & nbsp;269\u201372. < /ref >  But Young was then the only public defender of the wave theory. < ref name=frankel-p176 > Frankel, 1976, p. & nbsp;176; cf. & nbsp;Silliman, 1967, pp. & nbsp;142\u20133. < /ref > \n \n In summary, in the spring of 1814, as Fresnel tried in vain to guess what polarization was, the corpuscularists thought that they knew, while the wave-theorists (if we may use the plural) literally had no idea. Both theories claimed to explain rectilinear propagation, but the wave explanation was overwhelmingly regarded as unconvincing. The corpuscular theory could not rigorously link double refraction to surface forces; the wave theory could not yet link it to polarization. The corpuscular theory was weak on thin plates and silent on gratings; < ref group=Note > Newton (1730) observed feathers acting as reflection gratings and as a transmission gratings, but classified the former case under thin plates (p. & nbsp;252), and the latter, more vaguely, under inflection (p. & nbsp;322). In retrospect, the latter experiment (p. & nbsp;322, end of Obs. & nbsp;2) is dangerous to eyesight and should not be repeated as written. < /ref >  the wave theory was strong on both, but under-appreciated. Concerning diffraction, the corpuscular theory did not yield quantitative predictions, while the wave theory had begun to do so by considering diffraction as a manifestation of interference, but had only considered two rays at a time. Only the corpuscular theory gave even a vague insight into Brewster's angle, Malus's law, or optical rotation. Concerning chromatic polarization, the wave theory explained the periodicity far better than the corpuscular theory, but had nothing to say about the role of polarization; and its explanation of the periodicity was largely ignored. < ref > Frankel, 1976, p. & nbsp;155. < /ref >  And Arago had founded the study of chromatic polarization, only to lose the lead, controversially, to Biot. Such were the circumstances in which Arago first heard of Fresnel's interest in optics. \n \n === R\u00eaveries === \n [[File:L\u00e9onor M\u00e9rim\u00e9e.jpg|thumb|[[Bas-relief]] of Fresnel's uncle L\u00e9onor M\u00e9rim\u00e9e (1757\u20131836), on the same wall as the Fresnel monument in Broglie{{r|martan-2014}}]] \n \n Fresnel's letters from later in 1814 reveal his interest in the wave theory, including his awareness that it explained the constancy of the speed of light and was at least compatible with stellar aberration.

To explain the diffraction pattern, Fresnel constructed the internal fringes by considering the intersections of circular wavefronts emitted from the two edges of the obstruction, and the external fringes by considering the intersections between direct waves and waves reflected off the nearer edge. For the external fringes, to obtain tolerable agreement with observation, he had to suppose that the reflected wave was [[Phase reversal|inverted]]; and he noted that the predicted paths of the fringes were hyperbolic. In the part of the memoir that most clearly surpassed Young, Fresnel explained the ordinary laws of reflection and refraction in terms of interference, noting that if two parallel rays were reflected or refracted at other than the prescribed angle, they would no longer have the same [[phase (waves)|phase]] in a common perpendicular plane, and every vibration would be cancelled by a nearby vibration. He noted that his explanation was valid provided that the surface irregularities were much smaller than the wavelength. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;119,{{tsp}}131\u20132; Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;199\u2013201; Kipnis, 1991, pp. & nbsp;175\u20136. < /ref > \n \n On 10 November, Fresnel sent a supplementary note dealing with Newton's rings and with gratings, < ref > Darrigol, 2012, p. & nbsp;201. < /ref >  including, for the first time, ''transmission'' gratings \u2013 although in that case the interfering rays were still assumed to be  \" inflected \" , and the experimental verification was inadequate because it used only two threads. < ref > Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;1, pp. & nbsp;48\u20139; Kipnis, 1991, pp. & nbsp;176\u20138. < /ref > \n \n As Fresnel was not a member of the institute, the fate of his memoir depended heavily on the report of a single member.

To explain this, he divided the incident wavefront at the obstacle into what we now call ''[[Fresnel zone]]s'', such that the secondary waves from each zone were spread over half a cycle when they arrived at the observation point. The zones on one side of the obstacle largely canceled out in pairs, except the first zone, which was represented by an  \" efficacious ray \" . This approach worked for the internal fringes, but the superposition of the efficacious ray and the direct ray did ''not'' work for the ''external'' fringes. < ref > Silliman, 1967, pp. & nbsp;177\u20139; Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;201\u20133. < /ref > \n \n The contribution from the  \" efficacious ray \"  was thought to be only ''partly'' canceled, for reasons involving the dynamics of the medium: where the wavefront was continuous, symmetry forbade oblique vibrations; but near the obstacle that truncated the wavefront, the asymmetry allowed some sideways vibration towards the geometric shadow. This argument showed that Fresnel had not (yet) fully accepted Huygens's principle, which would have permitted oblique radiation from all portions of the front. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;134\u20135,{{tsp}}144\u20135; Silliman, 1967, pp. & nbsp;176\u20137. < /ref > \n \n In the same supplement, Fresnel described his well-known double mirror, comprising two flat mirrors joined at an angle of slightly less than 180\u00b0, with which he produced a two-slit interference pattern from two virtual images of the same slit. A conventional double-slit experiment required a preliminary ''single'' slit to ensure that the light falling on the double slit was ''[[coherence (physics)|coherent]]'' (synchronized). In Fresnel's version, the preliminary single slit was retained, and the double slit was replaced by the double mirror \u2013 which bore no physical resemblance to the double slit and yet performed the same function. This result (which had been announced by Arago in the March issue of the ''Annales'') made it hard to believe that the two-slit pattern had anything to do with corpuscles being deflected as they passed near the edges of the slits. < ref > Silliman, 1967, pp. & nbsp;173\u20135; Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;137\u20138; Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;201\u20132; Boutry, 1948, p. & nbsp;597; Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;1, pp. & nbsp;123\u20138 (Arago's announcement). < /ref > \n \n But 1816 was the  \" [[Year Without a Summer]] \" : crops failed; hungry farming families lined the streets of Rennes; the central government organized  \" charity workhouses \"  for the needy; and in October, Fresnel was sent back to Ille-et-Vilaine to supervise charity workers in addition to his regular road crew. < ref > Levitt, 2013, p. & nbsp;43; Boutry, 1948, p. & nbsp;599. < /ref >  According to Arago, \n {{quote|with Fresnel conscientiousness was always the foremost part of his character, and he constantly performed his duties as an engineer with the most rigorous scrupulousness.

He restated Huygens's principle in combination with the [[superposition principle]], saying that the vibration at each point on a wavefront is the sum of the vibrations that would be sent to it at that moment by all the elements of the wavefront in any of its previous positions, all elements acting separately {{xref|(see [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]])}}. For a wavefront partly obstructed in a previous position, the summation was to be carried out over the unobstructed portion. In directions other than the normal to the primary wavefront, the secondary waves were weakened due to obliquity, but weakened much more by destructive interference, so that the effect of obliquity alone could be ignored. < ref > Cf.

For completeness, he repeated his solution to  \" the problem of interference \" , whereby sinusoidal functions are added like vectors. He acknowledged the directionality of the secondary sources and the variation in their distances from the observation point, chiefly to explain why these things make negligible difference in the context, provided of course that the secondary sources do not radiate in the retrograde direction. Then, applying his theory of interference to the secondary waves, he expressed the intensity of light diffracted by a single straight edge (half-plane) in terms of integrals which involved the dimensions of the problem, but which could be converted to the normalized forms above. With reference to the integrals, he explained the calculation of the maxima and minima of the intensity (external fringes), and noted that the calculated intensity falls very rapidly as one moves into the geometric shadow. < ref > Crew, 1900, pp. & nbsp;101\u20138 (vector-like representation), 109 (no retrograde radiation), 110\u201311 (directionality and distance), 118\u201322 (derivation of integrals), 124\u20135 (maxima  &  minima), 129\u201331 (geometric shadow). < /ref >  The last result, as Olivier Darrigol says,  \" amounts to a proof of the rectilinear propagation of light in the wave theory, indeed the first proof that a modern physicist would still accept. \" {{hsp}} < ref > Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;204\u20135. < /ref > \n \n For the experimental testing of his calculations, Fresnel used red light with a wavelength of 638{{nbsp}}nm, which he deduced from the diffraction pattern in the simple case in which light incident on a single slit was focused by a cylindrical lens.

For the slit and the strip, he could not use the previously computed table of maxima and minima; for each combination of dimensions, the intensity had to be expressed in terms of sums or differences of Fresnel integrals and calculated from the table of integrals, and the extrema had to be calculated anew. < ref > Crew, 1900, pp. & nbsp;127\u20138 (wavelength), 129\u201331 (half-plane), 132\u20135 (extrema, slit); Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;1, pp. & nbsp;350\u201355 (narrow strip). < /ref >  The agreement between calculation and measurement was better than 1.5% in almost every case. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;179\u201382. < /ref > \n \n Near the end of the memoir, Fresnel summed up the difference between Huygens's use of secondary waves and his own: whereas Huygens says there is light only where the secondary waves exactly agree, Fresnel says there is complete darkness only where the secondary waves exactly cancel out. < ref > Crew, 1900, p. & nbsp;144. < /ref > \n \n [[File:Simeon Poisson.jpg|thumb|left| < div style= \" text-align: center; \" > Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson (1781\u20131840) < /div > ]] \n \n The judging committee comprised Laplace, Biot, and [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson|Poisson]] (all corpuscularists), [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac|Gay-Lussac]] (uncommitted), and Arago, who eventually wrote the committee's report. < ref > Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;1, p. & nbsp;xlii; Worrall, 1989, p. & nbsp;136; Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;171,{{nbsp}}183; Levitt, 2013, pp. & nbsp;45\u20136. < /ref >  Although entries in the competition were supposed to be anonymous to the judges, Fresnel's must have been recognizable by the content. < ref > Levitt, 2013, p. & nbsp;46. < /ref >  There was only one other entry, of which neither the manuscript nor any record of the author has survived. < ref > Frankel, 1976, p. & nbsp;162.

While the corpuscular theory was obviously an emission theory, the converse did not follow: in principle, one could be an emissionist without being a corpuscularist. This was convenient because, beyond the ordinary laws of reflection and refraction, emissionists never managed to make testable quantitative predictions from a theory of forces acting on corpuscles of light. But they ''did'' make quantitative predictions from the premises that rays were countable objects, which were conserved in their interactions with matter (except absorbent media), and which had particular orientations with respect to their directions of propagation. According to this framework, polarization and the related phenomena of double refraction and partial reflection involved altering the orientations of the rays and/or selecting them according to orientation, and the state of polarization of a beam (a & nbsp;bundle of rays) was a question of how many rays were in what orientations: in a fully polarized beam, the orientations were all the same. This approach, which [[Jed Buchwald]] has called ''selectionism'', was pioneered by Malus and diligently pursued by Biot. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;50\u201351,{{tsp}}63\u20135,{{tsp}}103\u20134; 2013, pp. & nbsp;448\u20139. < /ref > {{r|buchwald-1989b|p=110\u201313}} \n \n Fresnel, in contrast, decided to introduce polarization into interference experiments. \n \n ==== Interference of polarized light, chromatic polarization (1816\u201321) ==== \n \n In July or August 1816, Fresnel discovered that when a birefringent crystal produced two images of a single slit, he could ''not'' obtain the usual two-slit interference pattern, even if he compensated for the different propagation times. A more general experiment, suggested by Arago, found that if the two beams of a double-slit device were separately polarized, the interference pattern appeared and disappeared as the polarization of one beam was rotated, giving full interference for parallel polarizations, but no interference for perpendicular polarizations {{xref|(see [[Fresnel\u2013Arago laws]])}}. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;203,{{px2}}205; Darrigol, 2012, p. & nbsp;206; Silliman, 1967, pp. & nbsp;203\u20135. < /ref >  These experiments, among others, were eventually reported in a brief memoir published in 1819 and later translated into English. < ref > Arago  &  Fresnel, 1819. < /ref > \n \n In a memoir drafted on 30 August 1816 and revised on 6 October, Fresnel reported an experiment in which he placed two matching thin laminae in a double-slit apparatus \u2013 one over each slit, with their optic axes perpendicular \u2013 and obtained two interference patterns offset in opposite directions, with perpendicular polarizations. This, in combination with the previous findings, meant that each lamina split the incident light into perpendicularly polarized components with different velocities \u2013 just like a normal (thick) birefringent crystal, and contrary to Biot's  \" mobile polarization \"  hypothesis. < ref > Darrigol, 2012, p. & nbsp;207; Frankel, 1976, pp. & nbsp;163\u20134,{{tsp}}182. < /ref > \n \n Accordingly, in the same memoir, Fresnel offered his first attempt at a wave theory of chromatic polarization. When polarized light passed through a crystal lamina, it was split into ordinary and extraordinary waves (with intensities described by Malus's law), and these were perpendicularly polarized and therefore did not interfere, so that no colors were produced (yet). But if they then passed through an ''analyzer'' (second polarizer), their polarizations were brought into alignment (with intensities again modified according to Malus's law), and they would interfere. < ref > Darrigol, 2012, p. & nbsp;206. < /ref >  This explanation, by itself, predicts that if the analyzer is rotated 90\u00b0, the ordinary and extraordinary waves simply switch roles, so that if the analyzer takes the form of a calcite crystal, the two images of the lamina should be of the same hue (this issue is revisited below). But in fact, as Arago and Biot had found, they are of complementary colors. To correct the prediction, Fresnel proposed a phase-inversion rule whereby ''one'' of the constituent waves of ''one'' of the two images suffered an additional 180\u00b0 phase shift on its way through the lamina. This inversion was a weakness in the theory relative to Biot's, as Fresnel acknowledged, < ref > Frankel, 1976, p. & nbsp;164. < /ref >  although the rule specified which of the two images had the inverted wave. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, p. & nbsp;386. < /ref >  Moreover, Fresnel could deal only with special cases, because he had not yet solved the problem of superposing sinusoidal functions with arbitrary phase differences due to propagation at different velocities through the lamina. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;216,{{px2}}384. < /ref > \n \n He solved that problem in a  \" supplement \"  signed on 15 January 1818{{hsp}}{{r|fresnel-1818jan}} (mentioned above). In the same document, he accommodated Malus's law by proposing an underlying law: that if polarized light is incident on a birefringent crystal with its optic axis at an angle ''\u03b8'' to the  \" plane of polarization \" , the ordinary and extraordinary vibrations (as functions of time) are scaled by the factors cos{{tsp}}''\u03b8'' and sin{{tsp}}''\u03b8'', respectively. Although modern readers easily interpret these factors in terms of perpendicular components of a ''transverse'' oscillation, Fresnel did not (yet) explain them that way. Hence he still needed the phase-inversion rule. He applied all these principles to a case of chromatic polarization not covered by Biot's formulae, involving ''two'' successive laminae with axes separated by 45\u00b0, and obtained predictions that disagreed with Biot's experiments (except in special cases) but agreed with his own. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;333\u20136; Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;207\u20138. (Darrigol gives the date as 1817, but the page numbers in his footnote 95 fit his reference  \" 1818b \" , not  \" 1817 \" .) < /ref > \n \n Fresnel applied the same principles to the standard case of chromatic polarization, in which ''one'' birefringent lamina was sliced parallel to its axis and placed between a polarizer and an analyzer. If the analyzer took the form of a thick calcite crystal with its axis in the plane of polarization, Fresnel predicted that the intensities of the ordinary and extraordinary images of the lamina were respectively proportional to \n \n :: < math > I_o = \\cos^2i\\,\\cos^2(i{-}s) + \\sin^2i\\,\\sin^2(i{-}s) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sin 2i\\,\\sin 2(i{-}s)\\cos\\phi\\,, < /math > \n \n :: < math > I_e = \\cos^2i\\,\\sin^2(i{-}s) + \\sin^2i\\,\\cos^2(i{-}s) - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sin 2i\\,\\sin 2(i{-}s)\\cos\\phi\\,, < /math > \n \n where  < math > i < /math >  is the angle from the initial plane of polarization to the optic axis of the lamina,{{tsp}}  < math > s < /math >  is the angle from the initial plane of polarization to the plane of polarization of the final ordinary image, and  < math > \\phi < /math >  is the phase lag of the extraordinary wave relative to the ordinary wave due to the difference in propagation times through the lamina. The terms in  < math > \\phi < /math >  are the frequency-dependent terms and explain why the lamina must be ''thin'' in order to produce discernible colors: if the lamina is too thick,  < math > \\cos\\phi < /math >  will pass through too many cycles as the frequency varies through the visible range, and the eye (which divides the visible spectrum into only [[cone cell|three bands]]) will not be able to resolve the cycles. \n \n From these equations it is easily verified that  < math > \\,I_o+I_e=1\\, < /math >  for all  < math > \\phi, < /math >  so that the colors are complementary. Without the phase-inversion rule, there would be a ''plus'' sign in front of the last term in the second equation, so that the  < math > \\phi < /math > -dependent term would be the same in both equations, implying (incorrectly) that the colors were of the same hue. \n \n These equations were included in an undated note that Fresnel gave to Biot, < ref > Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;1, pp. & nbsp;533\u20137. On the provenance of the note, see p. & nbsp;523. In the above text, ''\u03c6'' is an abbreviation for Fresnel's {{nowrap|2''\u03c0''(''e''{{hsp}}\u2212{{hsp}}''o'')}}, where ''e'' and ''o'' are the numbers of cycles taken by the extraordinary and ordinary waves to travel through the lamina. < /ref >  to which Biot added a few lines of his own. If we substitute \n \n :: < math > U=\\cos^2\\tfrac{\\phi}{2} < /math >   & nbsp;and & nbsp;  < math > A=\\sin^2\\tfrac{\\phi}{2}\\,, < /math > \n \n then Fresnel's formulae can be rewritten as \n \n :: < math >  \\!I_o = U\\cos^2 s + A\\cos^2(2i-s)\\,, < /math > \n :: < math >    I_e = U\\sin^2 s + A\\sin^2(2i-s)\\,, < /math > \n \n which are none other than Biot's empirical formulae of 1812, < ref > Buchwald, 1989, p. & nbsp;97; Frankel, 1976, p.\u200a148. < /ref >  except that Biot interpreted  < math > U < /math >  and  < math > A < /math >  as the  \" unaffected \"  and  \" affected \"  selections of the rays incident on the lamina. If Biot's substitutions were accurate, they would imply that his experimental results were more fully explained by Fresnel's theory than by his own. \n \n Arago delayed reporting on Fresnel's works on chromatic polarization until June 1821, when he used them in a broad attack on Biot's theory. In his written response, Biot protested that Arago's attack went beyond the proper scope of a report on the nominated works of Fresnel. But Biot also claimed that the substitutions for  < math > U < /math >  and  < math > A, < /math >  and therefore Fresnel's expressions for  < math > I_o < /math >  and  < math > I_e, < /math >  were empirically wrong because when Fresnel's intensities of spectral colors were mixed according to Newton's rules, the squared cosine and sine functions varied too smoothly to account for the observed sequence of colors. That claim drew a written reply from Fresnel, < ref > Fresnel, 1821b. < /ref >  who disputed whether the colors changed as abruptly as Biot claimed, < ref > Fresnel, 1821b, \u00a73. < /ref >  and whether the human eye could judge color with sufficient objectivity for the purpose. On the latter question, Fresnel pointed out that different observers may give different names to the same color. Furthermore, he said, a single observer can only compare colors side by side; and even if they are judged to be the same, the identity is of sensation, not necessarily of composition. < ref > Fresnel, 1821b, \u00a71  &  footnotes. < /ref >  Fresnel's oldest and strongest point \u2013 that thin crystals were subject to the same laws as thick ones and did not need or allow a separate theory \u2013 Biot left unanswered. & nbsp; Arago and Fresnel were seen to have won the debate. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;237\u201351; Frankel, 1976, pp. & nbsp;165\u20138; Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;208\u20139. < /ref > \n \n Moreover, by this time Fresnel had a new, simpler explanation of his equations on chromatic polarization. \n \n ==== Breakthrough: Pure transverse waves (1821) ==== \n \n [[File:Andre-marie-ampere2.jpg|thumb| < div style= \" text-align: center; \" > Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re (1775\u20131836) < /div > ]] \n \n In the draft memoir of 30 August 1816, Fresnel mentioned two hypotheses \u2013 one of which he attributed to Amp\u00e8re \u2013 by which the non-interference of orthogonally-polarized beams could be explained if polarized light waves were ''partly'' [[transverse wave|transverse]]. But Fresnel could not develop either of these ideas into a comprehensive theory. As early as September 1816, according to his later account, < ref > Fresnel, 1821a, \u00a710. < /ref >  he realized that the non-interference of orthogonally-polarized beams, together with the phase-inversion rule in chromatic polarization, would be most easily explained if the waves were ''purely'' transverse, and Amp\u00e8re  \" had the same thought \"  on the phase-inversion rule. But that would raise a new difficulty: as natural light seemed to be ''un''polarized and its waves were therefore presumed to be longitudinal, one would need to explain how the longitudinal component of vibration disappeared on polarization, and why it did not reappear when polarized light was reflected or refracted obliquely by a glass plate. < ref > Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;1, p. & nbsp;394n; Fresnel, 1821a, \u00a710; Silliman, 1967, pp. & nbsp;209\u201310; Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;205\u20136,{{tsp}}208,{{tsp}}212,{{tsp}}218\u20139. < /ref > \n \n Independently, on 12 January 1817, Young wrote to Arago (in & nbsp;English) noting that a transverse vibration would constitute a polarization, and that if two longitudinal waves crossed at a significant angle, they could not cancel without leaving a residual transverse vibration. < ref > Young, 1855, p. & nbsp;383. < /ref >  Young repeated this idea in an article published in a supplement to the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' in February 1818, in which he added that Malus's law would be explained if polarization consisted in a transverse motion.{{r|young-1818|p=333\u20135}} \n \n Thus Fresnel, by his own testimony, may not have been the first person to suspect that light waves could have a transverse ''component'', or that ''polarized'' waves were exclusively transverse. And it was Young, not Fresnel, who first ''published'' the idea that polarization depends on the orientation of a transverse vibration. But these incomplete theories had not reconciled the nature of polarization with the apparent existence of ''unpolarized'' light; that achievement was to be Fresnel's alone. \n \n In a note that Buchwald dates in the summer of 1818, Fresnel entertained the idea that unpolarized waves could have vibrations of the same energy and obliquity, with their orientations distributed uniformly about the wave-normal, and that the degree of polarization was the degree of ''non''-uniformity in the distribution. Two pages later he noted, apparently for the first time in writing, that his phase-inversion rule and the non-interference of orthogonally-polarized beams would be easily explained if the vibrations of fully polarized waves were  \" perpendicular to the normal to the wave \" \u2014that is, purely transverse. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;225\u20136; Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;1, pp. & nbsp;526\u20137,{{tsp}}529. < /ref > \n \n But if he could account for ''lack'' of polarization by averaging out the transverse component, he did not also need to assume a longitudinal component. It was enough to suppose that light waves are ''purely'' transverse, hence ''always'' polarized in the sense of having a particular transverse orientation, and that the  \" unpolarized \"  state of natural or  \" direct \"  light is due to rapid and random variations in that orientation, in which case two ''coherent'' portions of  \" unpolarized \"  light will still interfere because their orientations will be synchronized. \n \n It is not known exactly when Fresnel made this last step, because there is no relevant documentation from 1820 or early 1821{{hsp}} < ref > Buchwald, 1989, p. & nbsp;226. < /ref >  (perhaps because he was too busy working on lighthouse-lens prototypes; see [[#Lighthouses and the Fresnel lens|below]]). But he first ''published'' the idea in a paper on  \" ''Calcul des teintes\u2026'' \"  ( \" calculation of the tints\u2026 \" ), serialized in Arago's ''Annales'' for May, June, and July 1821. < ref > Fresnel, 1821a. < /ref >  In the first installment, Fresnel described  \" direct \"  (unpolarized) light as  \" the rapid succession of systems of waves polarized in all directions \" , < ref > Buchwald, 1989, p. & nbsp;227; Fresnel, 1821a, \u00a71. < /ref >  and gave what is essentially the modern explanation of chromatic polarization, albeit in terms of the analogy between polarization and the resolution of forces in a plane, mentioning transverse waves only in a footnote. The introduction of transverse waves into the main argument was delayed to the second installment, in which he revealed the suspicion that he and Amp\u00e8re had harbored since 1816, and the difficulty it raised. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, p. & nbsp;212; Fresnel, 1821a, \u00a710. < /ref >  He continued: \n {{quote|It has only been for a few months that in meditating more attentively on this subject, I have realized that it was very probable that the oscillatory movements of light waves were executed solely along the plane of these waves, ''for direct light as well as for polarized light''. < ref > Fresnel, 1821a, \u00a710; emphasis added. < /ref > < ref group=Note > In the same installment, Fresnel acknowledged a letter from Young to Arago, dated 29 April 1818 (and lost before 1866), in which Young suggested that light waves could be analogous to waves on stretched strings. But Fresnel was dissatisfied with the analogy because it suggested both transverse and longitudinal modes of propagation and was hard to reconcile with a fluid medium (Silliman, 1967, pp. & nbsp;214\u20135; Fresnel, 1821a, \u00a713). < /ref > }} \n According to this new view, he wrote,  \" the act of polarization consists not in creating these transverse movements, but in decomposing them into two fixed perpendicular directions and in separating the two components \" . < ref > Fresnel, 1821a, \u00a713;{{tsp}} cf. & nbsp;Buchwald, 1989, p. & nbsp;228. < /ref > \n \n While selectionists could insist on interpreting Fresnel's diffraction integrals in terms of discrete, countable rays, they could not do the same with his theory of polarization. For a selectionist, the state of polarization of a beam concerned the distribution of orientations over the ''population'' of rays, and that distribution was presumed to be static. For Fresnel, the state of polarization of a beam concerned the variation of a displacement over ''time''. That displacement might be constrained but was ''not'' static, and rays were geometric constructions, ''not'' countable objects. The conceptual gap between the wave theory and selectionism had become unbridgeable. < ref > Cf. Buchwald, 1989, p. & nbsp;230. < /ref > \n \n The other difficulty posed by pure transverse waves, of course, was the apparent implication that the aether was an elastic ''solid'', except that, unlike other elastic solids, it was incapable of transmitting longitudinal waves. < ref group=Note > Fresnel, in an effort to show that transverse waves were not absurd, suggested that the aether was a fluid comprising a lattice of molecules, adjacent layers of which would resist a sliding displacement up to a certain point, beyond which they would gravitate towards a new equilibrium. Such a medium, he thought, would behave as a solid for sufficiently small deformations, but as a perfect liquid for larger deformations. Concerning the lack of longitudinal waves, he further suggested that the layers offered incomparably greater resistance to a change of spacing than to a sliding motion (Silliman, 1967, pp. & nbsp;216\u20138; Fresnel, 1821a, \u00a7\u00a7 & nbsp;11\u201312; cf. & nbsp;Fresnel, 1827, tr. & nbsp;Hobson, pp. & nbsp;258\u201362). < /ref >  The wave theory was cheap on assumptions, but its latest assumption was expensive on credulity. < ref > \" This hypothesis of Mr.{{nnbsp}}Fresnel is at least very ingenious, and may lead us to some satisfactory computations: but it is attended by one circumstance which is perfectly ''appalling'' in its consequences.

For reflection and refraction at the surface between two isotropic media of different indices, Fresnel decomposed the transverse vibrations into two perpendicular components, now known as the ''s'' and ''p'' components, which are parallel to the ''surface'' and the ''plane'' of incidence, respectively; in other words, the ''s'' and ''p'' components are respectively ''square'' and ''parallel'' to the plane of incidence. < ref group=Note > The ''s'' originally comes from the German ''senkrecht'', meaning perpendicular (to the plane of incidence). < /ref >  For the ''s'' component, Fresnel supposed that the interaction between the two media was analogous to an [[elastic collision]], and obtained a formula for what we now call the ''[[reflectivity]]'': the ratio of the reflected intensity to the incident intensity. The predicted reflectivity was non-zero at all angles. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;388\u201390; Fresnel, 1821a, \u00a718. < /ref > \n \n The third installment (July 1821) was a short  \" postscript \"  in which Fresnel announced that he had found, by a  \" mechanical solution \" , a formula for the reflectivity of the ''p'' component, which predicted that ''the reflectivity was zero at the Brewster angle''. So polarization by reflection had been accounted for \u2013 but with the proviso that the direction of vibration in Fresnel's model was ''perpendicular'' to the plane of polarization as defined by Malus. (On the ensuing controversy, see ''[[Plane of polarization]]''.) The technology of the time did not allow the ''s'' and ''p'' reflectivities to be measured accurately enough to test Fresnel's formulae at arbitrary angles of incidence. But the formulae could be rewritten in terms of what we now call the ''[[reflection coefficient]]'': the signed ratio of the reflected amplitude to the incident amplitude. Then, if the plane of polarization of the incident ray was at 45\u00b0 to the plane of incidence, the tangent of the corresponding angle for the reflected ray was obtainable from the ''ratio'' of the two reflection coefficients, and this angle could be measured. Fresnel had measured it for a range of angles of incidence, for glass and water, and the agreement between the calculated and measured angles was better than 1.5\u00b0 in all cases. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;390\u201391; Fresnel, 1821a, \u00a7\u00a7 & nbsp;20\u201322. < /ref > \n \n Fresnel gave details of the  \" mechanical solution \"  in a memoir read to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences on 7 January 1823.{{r|fresnel-1823a}} Conservation of energy was combined with continuity of the ''tangential'' vibration at the interface. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;391\u20133; Whittaker, 1910, pp. & nbsp;133\u20135. < /ref >  The resulting formulae for the reflection coefficients and reflectivities became known as the ''[[Fresnel equations]]''.

It would be considered left-handed/anti-clockwise circularly polarized if defined from the point of view of the receiver. If the rotating vector is resolved into horizontal and vertical components (not shown), these are a quarter-cycle out of phase with each other.]] \n \n In a memoir dated 9 December 1822,{{r|fresnel-1822z}} Fresnel coined the terms ''[[linear polarization]]'' (French: ''polarisation rectiligne'') for the simple case in which the perpendicular components of vibration are in phase or 180\u00b0 out of phase, ''[[circular polarization]]'' for the case in which they are of equal magnitude and a quarter-cycle (\u00b190\u00b0) out of phase, and ''[[elliptical polarization]]'' for other cases in which the two components have a fixed amplitude ratio and a fixed phase difference. He then explained how [[optical rotation]] could be understood as a species of birefringence. Linearly-polarized light could be resolved into two circularly-polarized components rotating in opposite directions. If these components propagated at slightly different speeds, the phase difference between them \u2013 and therefore the direction of their linearly-polarized resultant \u2013 would vary continuously with distance. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;230\u201332,{{tsp}}442. < /ref > \n \n These concepts called for a redefinition of the distinction between polarized and unpolarized light. Before Fresnel, it was thought that polarization could vary in direction, and in degree (e.g., due to variation in the angle of reflection off a transparent body), and that it could be a function of color (chromatic polarization), but not that it could vary in ''kind''. Hence it was thought that the degree of polarization was the degree to which the light could be suppressed by an analyzer with the appropriate orientation. Light that had been converted from linear to elliptical or circular polarization (e.g., by passage through a crystal lamina, or by total internal reflection) was described as partly or fully  \" depolarized \"  because of its behavior in an analyzer. ''After'' Fresnel, the defining feature of polarized light was that the perpendicular components of vibration had a fixed ratio of amplitudes and a fixed difference in phase. By that definition, elliptically or circularly polarized light is ''fully'' polarized although it cannot be fully suppressed by an analyzer alone. < ref > Cf. Buchwald, 1989, p. & nbsp;232. < /ref >  The conceptual gap between the wave theory and selectionism had widened again. \n \n ==== Total internal reflection (1817\u201323) ==== \n \n [[File:Fresnel rhomb linear to elliptical.svg|thumb|305px|Cross-section of a Fresnel rhomb (blue) with graphs showing the ''p'' component of vibration (''parallel'' to the ''plane'' of incidence) on the vertical axis, vs. the ''s'' component (''square'' to the plane of incidence and parallel to the ''surface'') on the horizontal axis. If the incoming light is ''linearly'' polarized, the two components are in phase (top & nbsp;graph). After one reflection at the appropriate angle, the ''p'' component is advanced by 1/8 of a cycle relative to the ''s'' component (middle & nbsp;graph). After two such reflections, the phase difference is 1/4 of a cycle (bottom & nbsp;graph), so that the polarization is ''elliptical'' with axes in the ''s'' & nbsp;and & nbsp;''p'' directions. If the ''s'' & nbsp;and & nbsp;''p'' components were initially of equal magnitude, the initial polarization (top & nbsp;graph) would be at 45\u00b0 to the plane of incidence, and the final polarization (bottom & nbsp;graph) would be ''circular''.]] \n \n By 1817 it had been discovered by Brewster,{{r|brewster-1817}} but not adequately reported, < ref > Lloyd, 1834, p. & nbsp;368. < /ref > {{r|young-1818|p=324}} that plane-polarized light was partly depolarized by total internal reflection if initially polarized at an acute angle to the plane of incidence. Fresnel rediscovered this effect and investigated it by including total internal reflection in a chromatic-polarization experiment. With the aid of his ''first'' theory of chromatic polarization, he found that the apparently depolarized light was a mixture of components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, and that the total reflection introduced a phase difference between them. < ref > Darrigol, 2012, p. & nbsp;207. < /ref >  Choosing an appropriate angle of incidence (not yet exactly specified) gave a phase difference of 1/8 of a cycle (45\u00b0). Two such reflections from the  \" parallel faces \"  of  \" two coupled [[prism]]s \"  gave a phase difference of 1/4 of a cycle (90\u00b0). These findings were contained in a memoir submitted to the Acad\u00e9mie on 10 November 1817 and read a fortnight later. An undated marginal note indicates that the two coupled prisms were later replaced by a single  \" parallelepiped in glass \" \u2014now known as a ''[[Fresnel rhomb]]''.{{r|fresnel-1817}} \n \n This was the memoir whose  \" supplement \" ,{{r|fresnel-1818jan}} dated January 1818, contained the method of superposing sinusoidal functions and the restatement of Malus's law in terms of amplitudes. In the same supplement, Fresnel reported his discovery that optical rotation could be emulated by passing the polarized light through a Fresnel rhomb (still in the form of  \" coupled prisms \" ), followed by an ordinary birefringent lamina sliced parallel to its axis, with the axis at 45\u00b0 to the plane of reflection of the Fresnel rhomb, followed by a second Fresnel rhomb at 90\u00b0 to the first. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;223,{{px2}}336; on the latter page, a  \" prism \"  means a Fresnel rhomb or equivalent. A footnote in the 1817 memoir (Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;1, p. & nbsp;460, note & nbsp;2) described the emulator more briefly, and not in a self-contained manner. < /ref >  In a further memoir read on 30 March, < ref > Fresnel, 1818a, especially pp. & nbsp;47\u20139. < /ref >  Fresnel reported that if polarized light was fully  \" depolarized \"  by a Fresnel rhomb \u2013 now described as a parallelepiped \u2013 its properties were not further modified by a subsequent passage through an optically rotating medium or device. \n \n The connection between optical rotation and birefringence was further explained in 1822, in the memoir on elliptical and circular polarization.{{r|fresnel-1822z}} This was followed by the memoir on reflection, read in January 1823, in which Fresnel quantified the phase shifts in total internal reflection, and thence calculated the precise angle at which a Fresnel rhomb should be cut in order to convert linear polarization to circular polarization. For a refractive index of 1.51, there were two solutions: about 48.6\u00b0 and 54.6\u00b0.{{r|fresnel-1823a|p=760}} \n \n === Double refraction === \n \n ==== Background: Uniaxial and biaxial crystals; Biot's laws ==== \n \n When light passes through a slice of calcite cut perpendicular to its optic axis, the difference between the propagation times of the ordinary and extraordinary waves has a second-order dependence on the angle of incidence. If the slice is observed in a highly convergent cone of light, that dependence becomes significant, so that a chromatic-polarization experiment will show a pattern of concentric rings. But most minerals, when observed in this manner, show a more complicated pattern of rings involving two foci and a [[lemniscate]] curve, as if they had ''two'' optic axes. < ref > Jenkins  &  White, 1976, pp. & nbsp;576\u20139 (\u00a7{{hsp}}27.9, esp. Fig. & nbsp;27M). < /ref > {{r|derochette-2004}} The two classes of minerals naturally become known as ''uniaxal'' and ''biaxal''\u2014or, in later literature, ''uniaxial'' and ''biaxial''. \n \n In 1813, Brewster observed the simple concentric pattern in  \" [[beryl]], [[emerald]], [[ruby]]  & c. \"  The same pattern was later observed in calcite by [[William Hyde Wollaston|Wollaston]], Biot, and [[Thomas Johann Seebeck|Seebeck]]. & nbsp; Biot, assuming that the concentric pattern was the general case, tried to calculate the colors with his theory of chromatic polarization, and succeeded better for some minerals than for others. In & nbsp;1818, Brewster belatedly explained why: seven of the twelve minerals employed by Biot had the lemniscate pattern, which Brewster had observed as early as 1812; and the minerals with the more complicated rings also had a more complicated law of refraction. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;254\u20135,{{tsp}}402. < /ref > \n \n In a uniform crystal, according to Huygens's theory, the secondary wavefront that expands from the origin in unit time is the ''ray-velocity surface''\u2014that is, the surface whose  \" distance \"  from the origin in any direction is the ray velocity in that direction. In calcite, this surface is two-sheeted, consisting of a sphere (for the ordinary wave) and an oblate spheroid (for the extraordinary wave) touching each other at opposite points of a common axis\u2014touching at the north and south poles, if we may use a geographic analogy. But according to Malus's ''corpuscular'' theory of double refraction, the ray velocity was proportional to the reciprocal of that given by Huygens's theory, in which case the velocity law was of the form \n \n :: < math > v_o^{2\\!}-v_e^2 = k\\sin^2\\theta \\,, < /math > \n \n where  < math > v_o < /math >  and  < math > v_e < /math >  were the ordinary and extraordinary ray velocities ''according to the corpuscular theory'', and  < math > \\theta < /math >  was the angle between the ray and the optic axis. < ref > Cf. Buchwald, 1989, p. & nbsp;269. < /ref >  By Malus's definition, the plane of polarization of a ray was the plane of the ray and the optic axis if the ray was ordinary, or the perpendicular plane (containing the ray) if the ray was extraordinary. In Fresnel's model, the direction of vibration was normal to the plane of polarization. Hence, for the sphere (the ordinary wave), the vibration was along the lines of latitude (continuing the geographic analogy); and for the spheroid (the extraordinary wave), the vibration was along the lines of longitude. \n \n On 29 March 1819, < ref > Grattan-Guinness, 1990, p. & nbsp;885. < /ref >  Biot presented a memoir in which he proposed simple generalizations of Malus's rules for a crystal with ''two'' axes, and reported that both generalizations seemed to be confirmed by experiment. For the velocity law, the squared sine was replaced by the ''product'' of the sines of the angles from the ray to the two axes (''Biot's sine law''). And for the polarization of the ordinary ray, the plane of the ray and the axis was replaced by the plane bisecting the [[dihedral angle]] between the two planes each of which contained the ray and one axis (''Biot's dihedral law''). < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;269,{{px2}}418. < !-- On p.269, in connection with the dihedral law, Buchwald cites Biot's  \" Pr\u00e9cis \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire... \" , which is listed in the bibliography as Biot 1817.

In such cases this article prefers the generic word  \" submitted \" , to avoid the impression that the paper had a formal reading. < /ref >  on 19 November 1821, < ref > Printed in Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;2, pp. & nbsp;261\u2013308. < /ref >  Fresnel reported two experiments on [[topaz]] showing that ''neither refraction'' was ordinary in the sense of satisfying Snell's law; that is, neither ray was the product of spherical secondary waves. < ref > Silliman, 1967, pp. & nbsp;243\u20136 (first experiment); Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;261\u20137 (both experiments). The first experiment was briefly reported earlier in Fresnel, 1821c. < /ref > \n \n The same memoir contained Fresnel's first attempt at the biaxial velocity law. For calcite, if we interchange the equatorial and polar radii of Huygens's oblate spheroid while preserving the polar direction, we obtain a ''prolate'' spheroid touching the sphere at the equator. A & nbsp;plane through the center/origin cuts this prolate spheroid in an ellipse whose major and minor semi-axes give the magnitudes of the extraordinary and ordinary ray velocities in the direction normal to the plane, and (said Fresnel) the directions of their respective vibrations. The direction of the optic axis is the normal to the plane for which the ellipse of intersection reduces to a ''circle''. So, for the biaxial case, Fresnel simply replaced the prolate spheroid with a triaxial [[ellipsoid]], which he called the  \" ellipsoid of elasticity \" , to be sectioned by a plane in the same way. In general there would be ''two'' planes passing through the center of the ellipsoid and cutting it in a circle, and the normals to these planes would give ''two'' optic axes. From the geometry, Fresnel deduced Biot's sine law (with the ray velocities replaced by their reciprocals). < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;268\u201372. < /ref > \n \n The  \" ellipsoid of elasticity \"  indeed gave the correct ray velocities, although the initial experimental verification was only approximate. But it did not give the correct directions of vibration, for the biaxial case or even for the uniaxial case, because the vibrations in Fresnel's model were tangential to the wavefront, which is ''not'' generally normal to the ray (for an extraordinary ray). This mistake was corrected in an  \" extract \"  that Fresnel read to the Acad\u00e9mie a week later, on 26 November. Starting with Huygens's spheroid, Fresnel obtained the 4th-degree  \" surface of elasticity \"  which, when sectioned by a plane as above, would yield the ''wave-normal velocities'' for a wavefront in that plane, together with their vibration directions. For the biaxial case, he generalized the surface to allow three unequal principal dimensions. But he retained the former  \" ellipsoid of elasticity \"  as an approximation, from which he deduced Biot's dihedral law. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;274\u20139. < /ref > \n \n Fresnel's initial derivation of the  \" surface of elasticity \"  had been purely geometric, and not deductively rigorous. His first attempt at a ''mechanical'' derivation, contained in a  \" supplement \"  dated 13 January 1822, assumed that (i) & nbsp;there were three mutually perpendicular directions in which a displacement produced a reaction in the same direction, (ii) & nbsp;the reaction was otherwise a linear function of the displacement, and (iii) & nbsp;the radius of the surface in any direction was the square root of the component, ''in that direction'', of the reaction to a unit displacement in that direction. The last assumption recognized the requirement that if a wave was to maintain a fixed direction of propagation and a fixed direction of vibration, the reaction must not be outside the plane of those two directions. < ref > Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;279\u201380. < /ref > \n \n In the same supplement, Fresnel considered how he might find, for the biaxial case, the secondary wavefront that expands from the origin in unit time \u2013 that is, the surface that reduces to Huygens's sphere and spheroid in the uniaxial case. He noted that this  \" wave surface \"  (''surface de l'onde'') < ref > Literally  \" surface of the wave \"  \u2014 as in Hobson's translation of Fresnel 1827. < /ref >  is tangential to all possible plane wavefronts that could have crossed the origin one unit of time ago, and he listed the mathematical conditions that it must satisfy.

Brewster himself immediately and correctly attributed this phenomenon to stress-induced birefringence{{hsp}}{{r|brewster-1815a|brewster-1816}} \u2014 now known as ''[[photoelasticity]]''. \n \n In a memoir read in September 1822, Fresnel announced that he had verified Brewster's diagnosis more directly, by compressing a combination of glass prisms so severely that one could actually see a double image through it. In his experiment, Fresnel lined up seven [[Porro prism|45\u00b0-90\u00b0-45\u00b0 & nbsp;prisms]], short side to short side, with their 90\u00b0 & nbsp;angles pointing in alternating directions. Two half-prisms were added at the ends to make the whole assembly rectangular. The prisms were separated by thin films of [[turpentine]] (''[[Pistacia terebinthus|t\u00e9r\u00e9benthine]]'') to suppress internal reflections, allowing a clear line of sight along the row. When the four prisms with similar orientations were compressed in a [[vise]] across the line of sight, an object viewed through the assembly produced two images with perpendicular polarizations, with an apparent spacing of 1.5{{nbsp}}mm at one metre.{{r|fresnel-1822s}} < ref > Whewell, 1857, pp. & nbsp;355\u20136. < /ref > \n \n At the end of that memoir, Fresnel predicted that one could use an analogous arrangement of prisms, without compression, to verify that optical rotation is a form of birefringence. If the prisms were cut from monocrystalline quartz with their optic axes aligned along the row, and with alternating directions of optical rotation, an object seen by looking along the common optic axis would give two images, which would seem unpolarized if viewed through an analyzer alone; but if viewed through a Fresnel rhomb, they would be polarized at \u00b145\u00b0 to the plane of reflection (because they would initially be circularly polarized in opposite directions). In the memoir of December 1822, in which he introduced the term ''circular polarization'', he reported that he had confirmed this prediction. To obtain a visible separation of the images, he needed only one 14\u00b0-152\u00b0-14\u00b0 prism and two half-prisms; he merely remarked in passing that one could increase the separation by increasing the number of prisms. < ref > Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;1, pp. & nbsp;737\u20139. & nbsp; Cf. & nbsp;Whewell, 1857, p. & nbsp;356\u20138; Jenkins  &  White, 1976, pp. & nbsp;589\u201390. < /ref > \n \n === Reception === \n \n For the supplement to Riffault's translation of [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomson]]'s ''System of Chemistry'', Fresnel was chosen to contribute the article on light.

Starting from assumed equations of motion of a fluid medium, he noted that they did not give the correct results for partial reflection and double refraction \u2013 as if that were Fresnel's problem rather than his own \u2013 and that the predicted waves, even if they were initially transverse, became more longitudinal as they propagated. In reply Fresnel noted, ''inter alia'', that the equations in which Poisson put so much faith did not even predict [[viscosity]]. The implication was clear: given that the behavior of light had not been satisfactorily explained except by transverse waves, it was not the responsibility of the wave-theorists to abandon transverse waves in deference to pre-conceived notions about the aether; rather, it was the responsibility of the aether modelers to produce a model that accommodated transverse waves. < ref > Frankel, 1976, pp. & nbsp;170\u201371; cf. & nbsp;Fresnel, 1827, tr. & nbsp;Hobson, pp. & nbsp;243\u20134,{{tsp}}262. < /ref >  According to Robert H. & nbsp;Silliman, Poisson eventually accepted the wave theory shortly before his death in 1840. < ref > Silliman, 1967, pp. & nbsp;284\u20135, citing Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;1, p. & nbsp;lxxxix, note & nbsp;2. & nbsp; Frankel (1976, p. & nbsp;173) agrees.

Fresnel suggested instead that there was a ''microscopic'' current circulating around each particle of the magnet. In his first note, he argued that microscopic currents, unlike macroscopic currents, would explain why a hollow cylindrical magnet does not lose its magnetism when cut longitudinally. In his second note, dated 5 July 1821, he further argued that a macroscopic current had the counterfactual implication that a permanent magnet should be hot, whereas microscopic currents circulating around the molecules might avoid the heating mechanism.{{r|assis-chaib-2015|p=101\u20134}} He was not to know that the fundamental units of permanent magnetism are even smaller than molecules {{xref|(see [[Electron magnetic moment]])}}.

The manuscript was received by the publisher's agent in Paris in early September 1824, and promptly forwarded to London. But the journal failed before Fresnel's contribution could be published. Fresnel tried unsuccessfully to recover the manuscript.

In & nbsp;1818, Fresnel showed that this result could be explained by the wave theory, < ref > Cf. Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;258\u201360. < /ref >  on the hypothesis that if an object with refractive index  < math > n < /math >  moved at velocity  < math > v < /math >  relative to the external aether (taken as stationary), then the velocity of light inside the object gained the additional component  < math > \\,v(1-1/n^2) < /math > . He supported that hypothesis by supposing that if the density of the external aether was taken as unity, the density of the internal aether was  < math > n^2 < /math > , of which the excess, namely  < math > \\,n^2{-}1\\, < /math > , was dragged along at velocity  < math > v < /math > , whence the ''average'' velocity of the internal aether was  < math > \\,v(1-1/n^2) < /math > . The factor in parentheses, which Fresnel originally expressed in terms of wavelengths, < ref > Fresnel, 1818c. < /ref >  became known as the ''Fresnel drag coefficient''. {{xref|(See [[Aether drag hypothesis]].)}} \n \n In his analysis of double refraction, Fresnel supposed that the different refractive indices in different directions within the ''same medium'' were due to a directional variation in elasticity, not density (because the concept of mass per unit volume is not directional). But in his treatment of partial reflection, he supposed that the different refractive indices of ''different media'' were due to different aether densities, not different elasticities. < ref > Darrigol, 2012, p. & nbsp;212; Fresnel, 1821a, \u00a7\u00a7 & nbsp;14,{{tsp}}18. < /ref >  The latter decision, although puzzling in the context of double refraction, was consistent with the earlier treatment of aether drag. \n \n In 1846, [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Gabriel Stokes]] pointed out that there was no need to divide the aether inside a moving object into two portions; all of it could be considered as moving at a common velocity. Then, if the aether was conserved while its density changed in proportion to  < math > n^2 < /math > , the resulting velocity of the aether inside the object was equal to Fresnel's additional velocity component. < ref > Whittaker, 1910, p. & nbsp;117. < /ref > {{r|stokes-1846}} \n \n === Dispersion === \n \n The analogy between light waves and transverse waves in elastic solids does not predict ''[[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]'' \u2014 that is, the frequency-dependence of the speed of propagation, which enables [[dispersive prism|prisms]] to produce spectra and causes lenses to suffer from [[chromatic aberration]]. Fresnel, in ''De la Lumi\u00e8re'' and in the second supplement to his first memoir on double refraction, suggested that dispersion could be accounted for if the particles of the medium exerted forces on each other over distances that were significant fractions of a wavelength. < ref > Darrigol, 2012, p. & nbsp;246; Buchwald, 1989, pp. & nbsp;307\u20138;{{tsp}} Fresnel, 1822a, tr. & nbsp;Young, in ''Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature, and Art'',{{tsp}} Jan.\u2013{{hsp}}Jun.{{tsp}}1828, at pp. & nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SbJMAAAAYAAJ & pg=PA213 213\u201315]. & nbsp; Whittaker, 1910, p. & nbsp;132; Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;2, p. & nbsp;438. < /ref >  Later, more than once, Fresnel referred to the demonstration of this result as being contained in a note appended to his  \" second memoir \"  on double refraction. < ref > Fresnel, 1827, tr. & nbsp;Hobson, pp. & nbsp;277n,{{px2}}331n; Lloyd, 1834, p. & nbsp;316. < /ref >  But no such note appeared in print, and the relevant manuscripts found after his death showed only that, around 1824, he was comparing refractive indices (measured by Fraunhofer) with a theoretical formula, the meaning of which was not fully explained. < ref > Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol. & nbsp;1, p. & nbsp;xcvi. < /ref > \n \n In the 1830s, Fresnel's suggestion was taken up by Cauchy, [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Powell]], and [[Philip Kelland|Kelland]], and it was indeed found to be tolerably consistent with the variation of refractive indices with wavelength over the [[visible spectrum]], for a variety of transparent media {{xref|(see [[Cauchy's equation]])}}. < ref > Whittaker, 1910, pp. & nbsp;182\u20133; Whewell, 1857, pp. & nbsp;365\u20137; Darrigol, 2012, pp. & nbsp;246\u20139. < /ref >  These investigations were enough to show that the wave theory was at least ''compatible'' with dispersion. However, if the model of dispersion was to be accurate over a wider range of frequencies, it needed to be modified so as to take account of resonances within the medium {{xref|(see [[Sellmeier equation]])}}. < ref > Darrigol, 2012, p. & nbsp;252. < /ref > \n \n === Conical refraction === \n \n The analytical complexity of Fresnel's derivation of the ray-velocity surface was an implicit challenge to find a shorter path to the result.

As Hamilton noted, these properties respectively imply that (i) & nbsp;a & nbsp;narrow beam propagating inside the crystal in the direction of the single ray velocity will, on exiting the crystal through a flat surface, break into a hollow cone (''external conical refraction''), and (ii) & nbsp;a & nbsp;narrow beam striking a flat surface of the crystal in the appropriate direction (corresponding to that of the single internal wave-normal velocity) will, on entering the crystal, break into a hollow cone (''internal conical refraction''). < ref > Lloyd, 1834, p. & nbsp;389. < /ref > {{r|hamilton-1832}} \n \n Thus a new pair of phenomena, ''qualitatively'' different from anything previously observed or suspected, had been predicted by mathematics as consequences of Fresnel's theory. The prompt experimental confirmation of those predictions by [[Humphrey Lloyd (physicist)|Humphrey Lloyd]]{{hsp}}{{r|lloyd-1833}} brought Hamilton a prize that had never come to Fresnel: immediate fame.{{r|lunney-weaire-2006|oHara-1982}} \n \n == Legacy == \n \n [[File:Cordouan6.jpg|thumb|The lantern room of the [[Cordouan Lighthouse]], in which the first Fresnel lens entered service in 1823. The current fixed catadioptric  \" beehive \"  lens replaced Fresnel's original rotating lens in 1854.{{r|pharedeC}}]] \n \n Within a century of Fresnel's initial stepped-lens proposal, more than 10,000 lights with Fresnel lenses were protecting lives and property around the world. < ref > Levitt, 2013, p. & nbsp;19. < /ref >  Concerning the other benefits, the science historian Theresa H.

Whereas [[Albert Einstein]] described Maxwell's work as  \" the most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of Newton, \" {{hsp}}{{r|jamesCMF}} commentators of the era between Fresnel and Maxwell made similarly strong statements about Fresnel: \n * MacCullagh, as early as 1830, wrote that Fresnel's mechanical theory of double refraction  \" would do honour to the sagacity of Newton \" .{{r|macCullagh-1830|p=78}} \n < !-- These dot-points are spaced because they include blockquotes. -- > \n * Lloyd, in his ''Report on the progress and present state of physical optics'' (1834) for the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]], surveyed previous knowledge of double refraction and declared: < blockquote > The theory of Fresnel to which I now proceed,\u2014 and which not only embraces all the known phenomena, but has even outstripped observation, and predicted consequences which were afterwards fully verified,\u2014 will, I am persuaded, be regarded as the finest generalization in physical science which has been made since the discovery of universal gravitation. < ref > Lloyd, 1834, p. & nbsp;382. < /ref > < /blockquote > In 1841 Lloyd published his ''Lectures on the Wave-theory of Light'', in which he described Fresnel's transverse-wave theory as  \" the noblest fabric which has ever adorned the domain of physical science, Newton's system of the universe alone excepted. \" {{hsp}}{{r|lloyd-1841}} \n < !-- These dot-points are spaced because they include blockquotes. -- > \n * [[William Whewell]], in all three editions of his ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' (1837, 1847, and 1857), at the end of Book & nbsp;{{serif|IX}}, compared the histories of physical astronomy and physical optics and concluded: < blockquote > It would, perhaps, be too fanciful to attempt to establish a parallelism between the prominent persons who figure in these two histories. If we were to do this, we must consider [[Christiaan Huygens|Huyghens]] and [[Robert Hooke|Hooke]] as standing in the place of [[Copernicus]], since, like him, they announced the true theory, but left it to a future age to give it development and mechanical confirmation; [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Malus|Malus]] and [[David Brewster|Brewster]], grouping them together, correspond to [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], laborious in accumulating observations, inventive and happy in discovering laws of phenomena; and Young and Fresnel combined, make up the Newton of optical science. < ref > Whewell, 1857, pp. & nbsp;370\u201371. < /ref > < /blockquote > \n \n What Whewell called the  \" true theory \"  has since undergone two major revisions. The first, by Maxwell, specified the physical fields whose variations constitute the waves of light. Without the benefit of this knowledge, Fresnel managed to construct the world's first coherent theory of light, showing in retrospect that his methods are applicable to multiple types of waves. The second revision, initiated by Einstein's explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]], supposed that the energy of light waves was divided into [[quantum|quanta]], which were eventually identified with particles called [[photon]]s. But photons did not exactly correspond to Newton's corpuscles; for example, Newton's explanation of ordinary refraction required the corpuscles to travel faster in media of higher refractive index, which photons do not. Neither did photons displace waves; rather, they led to the paradox of [[wave\u2013particle duality]]. Moreover, the phenomena studied by Fresnel, which included nearly all the optical phenomena known at his time, are still most easily explained in terms of the ''wave'' nature of light. So it was that, as late as 1927, the astronomer [[E. M. Antoniadi|Eug\u00e8ne Michel Antoniadi]] declared Fresnel to be  \" the dominant figure in optics. \" {{nnbsp}}{{r|antoniadi-1927}} \n \n == See also == \n {{Portal|Biography|France|History of science|Engineering|Physics}} \n {{columns-list|colwidth=15em| \n * [[Birefringence]] \n * [[Catadioptric system]] \n * [[Circular polarization]] \n * [[Fresnel diffraction]] \n * [[Elliptical polarization]] \n * [[Fresnel (unit of frequency)]] \n * [[Fresnel\u2013Arago laws]] \n * [[Fresnel equations]] \n * [[Fresnel imager]] \n * [[Fresnel integral]] \n * [[Fresnel lantern]] \n * [[Fresnel lens]] \n * [[Fresnel number]] \n * [[Fresnel rhomb]] \n * [[Fresnel zone]] \n * [[Fresnel zone antenna]] \n * [[Wave surface|Fresnel's wave surface]] \n * Fresnel [[zone plate]] \n * [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]] \n * [[Linear polarization]] \n * [[Optical rotation]] \n * [[Phasor]] \n * [[Physical optics]] \n * [[Arago spot|Poisson's{{hsp}}/Arago's spot]] \n * [[polarization (waves)|Polarization]] \n * [[Ridged mirror]] \n }} \n \n ==Explanatory notes== \n {{reflist|group=Note}} \n \n == References == \n === Citations === \n {{Reflist|refs= \n \n < ref name=academie > Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, [http://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/dossiers/Fresnel/Fresnel_oeuvre.htm  \" Augustin Fresnel \" ], accessed 21 August 2017; [https://web.archive.org/web/20170215201835/http://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/dossiers/Fresnel/Fresnel_oeuvre.htm archived] 15 February 2017. < /ref > \n \n < ref name=academie-hist > Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, [http://www.academie-sciences.fr/en/Histoire-de-l-Academie-des-sciences/history-of-the-french-academie-des-sciences.html  \" History of the French Acad\u00e9mie des sciences \" ], accessed 8 December 2017; [https://web.archive.org/web/20170813034716/http://www.academie-sciences.fr/en/Histoire-de-l-Academie-des-sciences/history-of-the-french-academie-des-sciences.html archived] 13 August 2017. < /ref > \n \n < ref name=academie-pv6 > Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, ''Proces-verbaux des s\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie tenues depuis la fondation de l'Institut jusqu'au mois d'ao\u00fbt 1835'', [https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3299b vol. & nbsp;{{serif|VI}}] (for & nbsp;1816\u201319), Hendaye, Basses Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es: Imprimerie de l'Observatoire d'Abbadia, 1915. < /ref > \n \n < ref name=airy-1834 > G.B.

For a more comprehensive list, see  \" External links \"  below. \n \n The most detailed secondary source on Fresnel in English is apparently Buchwald 1989 {{nowrap|(24{{hsp}}+{{hsp}}474 pp.)}}\u2014in which Fresnel, although not named in the title, is clearly the central character. \n \n On lighthouse lenses, this article heavily cites Levitt 2013, Elton 2009, and Thomas Tag at the U.S. Lighthouse Society (see  \" External links \"  below). All three authors deal not only with Fresnel's contributions but also with later innovations that are not mentioned here (see ''[[Fresnel lens#History|Fresnel & nbsp;lens: History]]''). \n \n By comparison with the volume and impact of his scientific and technical writings, biographical information on Fresnel is remarkably scarce. There is no book-length critical biography of him, and anyone who proposes to write one must confront the fact that the letters published in his ''Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes''\u2014contrary to the title\u2014are heavily redacted. In the words of Robert H. Silliman (1967, p. & nbsp;6n):  \" By an unhappy judgment of the editors, dictated in part, one suspects, by political expediency, the letters appear in fragmentary form, preserving almost nothing beyond the technical discussions of Fresnel and his correspondents. \"  It is not clear from the secondary sources whether the manuscripts of those letters are still extant (cf. & nbsp;Grattan-Guinness, 1990, p.{{nnbsp}}854n). \n \n == External links == \n *{{Commons category-inline}} \n {{Wikiquote}} \n * [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4766520 List of English translations of works by Augustin Fresnel] at [[Zenodo]]. \n * [https://uslhs.org/ United States Lighthouse Society], especially  \" [https://uslhs.org/history/fresnel-lenses Fresnel Lenses] \" . \n * {{OL author|2296238A}}. \n * {{cite web|mode=cs2|title=Episode 3 \u2013 Augustin Fresnel|date=23 January 2019|publisher=\u00c9cole polytechnique|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDaQhpYYo50}}. \n \n {{Authority control}} \n \n {{DEFAULTSORT:Fresnel, Augustin-Jean}} \n [[Category:1788 births]] \n [[Category:1827 deaths]] \n [[Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis]] \n [[Category:19th-century physicists]] \n [[Category:Burials at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] \n [[Category:Corps des ponts]] \n [[Category:\u00c9cole des Ponts ParisTech alumni]] \n [[Category:\u00c9cole Polytechnique alumni]] \n [[Category:Foreign Members of the Royal Society]] \n [[Category:French civil engineers]] \n [[Category:French humanitarians]] \n [[Category:French physicists]] \n [[Category:French Roman Catholics]] \n [[Category:History of physics]] \n [[Category:Tuberculosis deaths in France]] \n [[Category:Jansenists]] \n [[Category:Light]] \n [[Category:Lighthouses]] \n [[Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences]] \n [[Category:Optical physicists]] \n [[Category:People from Eure]] \n [[Category:Physical optics]]"
