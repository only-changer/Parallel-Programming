Various short-lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed. The [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ethnologique de Paris]], the first to use the term ''[[ethnology]]'', was formed in 1839. Its members were primarily anti-slavery activists. When slavery was abolished in France in 1848, the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9'' was abandoned. \n \n Meanwhile, the Ethnological Society of New York, currently the [[American Ethnological Society]], was founded on its model in 1842, as well as the [[Ethnological Society of London]] in 1843, a break-away group of the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]]. < ref name=Schiller131 > {{harvnb|Schiller|1979|pp=130\u2013132}} < /ref >  These anthropologists of the times were liberal, anti-slavery, and pro-[[Human rights|human-rights activists.]] They maintained international connections. \n \n Anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century. Theorists in such diverse fields as [[Comparative anatomy|anatomy]], [[Comparative method (linguistics)|linguistics]], and [[ethnology]], making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then. < ref > {{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=221}} < /ref >  For them, the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect. Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in [[agronomy]] and in the wild. \n \n Darwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s. There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences. [[Paul Broca]] in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de biologie]] to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the [[Society of Anthropology of Paris|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Anthropologie de Paris]], meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859. < ref name=Fletcher > {{cite book | first=Robert | last=Fletcher | chapter=Paul Broca and the French School of Anthropology | title=The Saturday Lectures, Delivered in the Lecture-room of the U.

He wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech. He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called [[Broca's area]] after him. His interest was mainly in [[Biological anthropology]], but a German philosopher specializing in psychology, [[Theodor Waitz]], took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled ''Die Anthropologie der Naturv\u00f6lker'', 1859\u20131864. The title was soon translated as  \" The Anthropology of Primitive Peoples \" . The last two volumes were published posthumously. \n \n Waitz defined anthropology as  \" the science of the nature of man \" . Following Broca's lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from  \" the animals nearest to him \" . He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation. < ref > {{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=5}} < /ref >  The history of civilization, as well as ethnology, are to be brought into the comparison.

In 1863 the explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]] and the speech therapist [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] broke away from the [[Ethnological Society of London]] to form the [[Anthropological Society of London]], which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the French ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9'' were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, ''The Anthropological Review'', Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard. < ref name=hunt > {{harvnb|Hunt|1863|loc=Introductory Address}} < /ref > {{refn|group=n|Hunt's choice of theorists does not exclude the numerous other theorists that were beginning to publish a large volume of anthropological studies. < ref name=hunt/ > }} Among the first associates were the young [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], inventor of [[cultural anthropology]], and his brother [[Alfred Tylor]], a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist. \n \n Similar organizations in other countries followed: The Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the [[American Anthropological Association]] in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionist. One notable exception was the [[Berliner Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte|Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory]] (1869) founded by [[Rudolph Virchow]], known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin's conclusions lacked empirical foundation. \n \n During the last three decades of the 19th century, a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association. The major theorists belonged to these organizations. They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning. By 1898, 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology. None of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology. < ref > {{cite journal |  title=Extent of Instruction in Anthropology in Europe and the United States | first=George Grant | last=Maccurdy | journal=Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science | volume=10 | issue=260 | year=1899 | pages=382\u2013390 | url={{Google books|PA385|plainurl=yes}}| bibcode=1899Sci....10..910M | doi=10.1126/science.10.260.910 | pmid=17837336 }} < /ref > \n \n ===20th and 21st centuries=== \n This meager statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world's higher educational institutions, many thousands in number.

Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies. Archaeologists examine material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices. Ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups, who are presumed to have lived in similar ways. < ref > Robbins, R.H.  &  Larkin, S.N.

Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including [[sociolinguistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], [[semiotics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[narrative]] analysis. < ref > Salzmann, Zden\u011bk.

Boulder, CO: Westview Press. < /ref > \n \n == Key topics by field: sociocultural == \n \n ===Art, media, music, dance and film=== \n {{Anthropology of art}} \n \n ==== Art ==== \n {{main|Anthropology of art}} \n \n One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or 'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts. < ref > Layton, Robert. (1981) ''The Anthropology of Art''. < /ref >  To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. Boas' ''Primitive Art'', [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]]' ''The Way of the Masks'' (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'. \n \n ==== Media ==== \n {{main|Media anthropology}} \n [[File:Punu mask Gabon.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Punu tribe mask, Gabon, Central Africa]] \n Media anthropology (also known as the anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media. Other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movement]]s, or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]], and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Spitulnik, Deborah |title=Anthropology and Mass Media|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=22|page=293|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.22.100193.001453|url=http://www.philbu.net/media-anthropology/Spitulnik_MediaAnthro.pdf|year=1993}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|author=Abu-Lughod, Lila|year=1997|title=The Interpretation of Cultures after Television|journal=Representations|volume=59|issue=59|pages=109\u2013133|url=https://direitosehumanos.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/a-interpretac3a7c3a3o-das-culturas-depois-da-televisc3a3o.pdf|jstor=2928817|doi=10.1525/rep.1997.59.1.99p0026o|access-date=2 November 2016|archive-date=4 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104050457/https://direitosehumanos.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/a-interpretac3a7c3a3o-das-culturas-depois-da-televisc3a3o.pdf|url-status=live}} < /ref > \n \n ==== Music ==== \n {{main|Ethnomusicology}} \n [[Ethnomusicology]] is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music (broadly defined), that emphasize its cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire. \n \n [[Ethnomusicology]] can be used in a wide variety of fields, such as teaching, politics, cultural anthropology etc.\u00a0 While the origins of ethnomusicology date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, it was formally introduced as \u201cethnomusicology\u201d by Dutch scholar [[Jaap Kunst]] around 1950. Later, the influence of study in this area spawned the creation of the periodical ''[[Ethnomusicology (academic journal)|Ethnomusicology]]'' and the [[Society for Ethnomusicology|Society of Ethnomusicology]]. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Ethnomusicology|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/ethnomusicology|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-05-09|archive-date=18 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918122551/https://www.britannica.com/science/ethnomusicology|url-status=live}} < /ref > \n \n ==== Visual ==== \n {{main|Visual anthropology}} \n Visual anthropology is concerned, in part, with the study and production of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, [[new media]]. While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with [[ethnographic film]], visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and [[reception theory|reception]] of [[anthropology of media|mass media]]. Visual representations from all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings, and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology. \n \n === Economic, political economic, applied and development === \n {{Economic anthropology}} \n \n ==== Economic ==== \n {{main|Economic anthropology}} \n Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of anthropology, [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]], and his French compatriot, [[Marcel Mauss]], on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]]) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast. < ref > {{cite book|last=Hann|first=Chris|title=Economic Anthropology|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=55\u201371|author2=Hart, Keith |isbn=978-0-7456-4482-0}} < /ref >  Economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the [[global financial system]] from an anthropological perspective. \n \n ====Political economy==== \n {{main|Political economy in anthropology}} \n Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[historical materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the  \" pre-capitalist \"  societies that were subject to evolutionary  \" tribal \"  stereotypes. Sahlin's work on hunter-gatherers as the  \" original affluent society \"  did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist [[world-system]]. < ref name= \" Roseberry 1988 161\u201385 \" > {{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161\u2013185|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}} < /ref >  More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world. \n \n ==== Applied ==== \n {{main|Applied anthropology}} \n Applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. It is a  \" complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy \" . < ref > {{cite book|last=Kedia, Satish|first=and Willigen J. Van|title=Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application|isbn=978-0-275-97841-9|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn|pages=16, 150}} < /ref >  More simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. It is closely related to [[development anthropology]] (distinct from the more critical [[anthropology of development]]). \n \n ====Development==== \n {{main|anthropology of development}} \n Anthropology of development tends to view development from a ''critical'' perspective. The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short, why does so much planned development fail? \n \n ===Kinship, feminism, gender and sexuality=== \n {{Anthropology of kinship}} \n \n ==== Kinship ==== \n {{main|Kinship}} \n ''Kinship'' can refer both to ''the study of'' the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to ''the patterns of social relationships'' themselves. Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as  \" [[kinship|descent]] \" ,  \" [[descent group]]s \" ,  \" [[lineage (anthropology)|lineages]] \" ,  \" [[affinity (law)|affines]] \" ,  \" [[cognatic kinship|cognates]] \" , and even  \" [[fictive kinship]] \" . Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (one's social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage. Within kinship you have two different families. People have their biological families and it is the people they share DNA with. This is called consanguineal relations or  \" blood ties \" [http://content.inflibnet.ac.in/data-server/eacharya-documents/5717528c8ae36ce69422587d_INFIEP_304/66/ET/304-66-ET-V1-S1__file1.pdf ]. People can also have a chosen family [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/being-unlonely/201906/finding-connection-through-chosen-family Finding Connection Through  \" Chosen Family \" ] in which they chose who they want to be a part of their family. In some cases people are closer with their chosen family more than with their biological families. < ref > {{Cite book|last=Pountney, Laura|title=Introducing anthropology|others=Maric, Tomislav|date=5 October 2015|isbn=978-0-7456-9977-6|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=909318382}} < /ref > \n \n ==== Feminist ==== \n {{main|Feminist anthropology}} \n Feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ([[archaeology|archeological]], [[biological anthropology|biological]], [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge. Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white feminists of Europe, America, and elsewhere. From the perspective of the [[Western world]], historically such 'peripheral' perspectives have been ignored, observed only from an outsider perspective, and regarded as less-valid or less-important than knowledge from the Western world. Exploring and addressing that double bias against women from marginalized racial or ethnic groups is of particular interest in [[intersectional]] feminist anthropology. \n \n Feminist anthropologists have claimed{{who|date=March 2021}} that their research helps to correct these systematic biases in mainstream [[feminist theory]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[archaeology]], and anthropology. Feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of [[gender]] across societies. Gender constructs are of particular interest when studying [[sexism]]. \n \n The first [[African-American]] female [[anthropologist]] and [[Caribbeanist]] is said to be [[Vera Mae Green]] who studied ethnic and family relations in the [[Caribbean]] as well as the United States, and thereby tried to improve the way black life, experiences, and culture were studied. < ref > {{Cite journal | doi=10.1525/aa.1982.84.3.02a00080|title = Vera Mae Green, 1928\u20131982| journal=American Anthropologist| volume=84| issue=3| pages=633\u2013635|date = September 1982|last1 = Cole|first1 = Johnnetta B.| doi-access=free}} < /ref > \n \n Feminist anthropology is inclusive of the anthropology of birth < ref > {{Cite web | url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/2940.html | title=Springer Reference \u2013 Meteor | access-date=16 April 2013 | archive-date=25 March 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325014943/http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/2940.html | url-status=live }} < /ref >  as a specialization, which is the anthropological study of [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] within cultures and societies. \n \n ===Medical, nutritional, psychological, cognitive and transpersonal=== \n {{Medical anthropology}} \n \n ==== Medical ==== \n {{main|Medical anthropology}} \n \n Medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies  \" human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation \" . < ref name=McElroy1996 > {{Cite book |year=1996 |author=McElroy, A |chapter=Medical Anthropology |editor1=D.

Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole. It focuses on the following six basic fields: < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Dave|date=24 October 2016|title=Anthropology's Contribution to Public Health Policy Development|journal=McGill Journal of Medicine|volume=13|issue=1|page=76|issn=1201-026X|pmc=3277334|pmid=22363184}} < /ref > \n \n {{Quote| \n * the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care \n * the patient-physician relationship \n * the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments \n * the interaction of social, environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole \n * the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations ( \" critical ethnopsychiatry \" : Beneduce 2004, 2007) \n * the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western settings \n }} \n \n Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as ''cultural psychiatry'' and ''transcultural psychiatry'' or ''ethnopsychiatry''. \n \n ==== Nutritional ==== \n {{main|Nutritional anthropology}} \n \n Nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between [[economic systems]], [[nutrition|nutritional status]] and [[food security]], and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people. \n \n ==== Psychological ==== \n {{main|Psychological anthropology}} \n Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of [[cultural anthropology|cultural]] and [[psychology|mental processes]]. This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans' development and [[enculturation]] within a particular cultural group & nbsp;\u2013  with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories & nbsp;\u2013  shape processes of human [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[perception]], [[motivation]], and [[mental health]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=LeVine, R.

As with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and [[transpersonal experience]]. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues \u2013  for instance, the roles of [[Mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[Literature|texts]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Schroll, M.

Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more  \" complex \"  social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. Firstly, anthropologists continued to study [[political organization]] and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Secondly, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz' comparative work on  \" Negara \" , the Balinese state, is an early, famous example. \n \n ====Legal==== \n {{main|Legal anthropology}} \n Legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in  \" the cross-cultural study of social ordering \" . < ref > {{cite book | author = Greenhouse, Carol J. | title = Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town |isbn=978-0-8014-1971-3| location = Ithaca | publisher = Cornell UP | year = 1986 | page = 28}} < /ref >  Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation.

The sub-group was very closely related to [[science and technology studies|STS]] and the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]]. < ref > Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie (2001).  \" Cyborg Anthropology \" . in ''Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-92092-2}}. < /ref >  [[Donna Haraway]]'s 1985 ''[[Cyborg Manifesto]]'' could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term. Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings. \n \n ==== Digital ==== \n {{main|Digital anthropology}} \n Digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology, and extends to various areas where anthropology and [[technology]] intersect.

Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]], combining the [[Human development (biology)|human development]] with socioeconomic factors. Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as [[archaeology]], [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], [[primatology]], and [[genetics]].

American Anthropological Association (8 December 2009) < /ref > \n \n ==Post\u2013World War II developments== \n Before [[WWII]] British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology. \n \n ===Basic trends=== \n There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more [[Holism|holistic]] account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical. < ref name= \" Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79 \" / >  The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia. \n \n In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological. < ref > Rosaldo, Renato (1993).

Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]], of particular use in archaeology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as [[Olduwan]] or [[Mousterian]] or [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to [[culture regions]] as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences.
