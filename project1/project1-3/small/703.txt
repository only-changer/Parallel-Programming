Please do NOT list every known archipelago here.  This is the introductory lead to the general topic and should be kept brief and representative. \n     It is not the place for an exhaustive list of details.  Please resist the temptation to itemise the complete inventory of archipelagos. \n     You'll see that the  \" see also \"  section appropriately references an article  \" List of archipelagos by number of islands \" .  That, not here, is the place to maintain the inventory. \n -- > \n The [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian Archipelago]], the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], the [[Lakshadweep]] Islands, the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], the [[Japanese Archipelago]], the [[List of islands of the Philippines|Philippine Archipelago]], the [[Maldives]], the [[Balearic Isles]], [[the Bahamas]], the [[Aegean Islands]], the [[Hawaiian Islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[Malta]], the [[Azores]], the [[Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Arctic Archipelago]], the [[British Isles]],  the islands of the [[Archipelago Sea]], and [[Shetland]] are all examples of well-known archipelagos. They are sometimes defined by political boundaries. The Gulf archipelago off the north-eastern Pacific coast forms part of a larger archipelago that geographically includes Washington state's [[San Juan Islands]]. While the Gulf archipelago and San Juan Islands are geographically related, they are not technically included in the same archipelago due to manmade geopolitical borders. < ref > {{Cite web|last=US Department of Commerce|first=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|title=What is an archipelago?|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/archipelago.html|access-date=2020-07-07|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US}} < /ref > \n \n ==Etymology== \n The word ''archipelago'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] \u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9-(''arkhi-'',  \" chief \" ) and \u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (''p\u00e9lagos'',  \" sea \" ) through the Italian ''arcipelago''. In [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]],  \" Archipelago \"  (from [[medieval Greek]] [[Linguistic reconstruction|*]]\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 and [[medieval Latin|Latin]] {{Lang|la-x-medieval|archipelagus}}) was the proper name for the [[Aegean Sea]]. Later, usage shifted to refer to the [[Aegean Islands]] (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). \n \n ==Geographic types== \n Archipelagos may be found isolated in large amounts of water or neighbouring a large land mass. For example, [[Scotland]] has more than 700 & nbsp;islands surrounding its mainland which form an archipelago. \n \n Archipelagos are often volcanic, forming along island arcs generated by subduction zones or hotspots, but may also be the result of [[erosion]], [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]], and [[land elevation]]. Depending on their geological origin, islands forming archipelagos can be referred to as ''oceanic islands'', ''continental fragments'', and ''continental islands''. < ref > Whittaker R. J.  &  Fern\u00e1ndez-Palacios J. M. (2007) ''Island Biogeography: Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation''. New York, Oxford University Press < /ref > \n \n ===Oceanic islands=== \n Oceanic islands are mainly of volcanic origin, and widely separated from any adjacent continent. The [[Hawaiian Islands]] and [[Easter Island]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[\u00cele Amsterdam]] in the south [[Indian Ocean]] are examples. \n \n ===Continental fragments=== \n Continental fragments correspond to land masses that have separated from a continental mass due to [[tectonic]] displacement. The [[Farallon Islands]] off the coast of [[California]] are an example. \n \n ===Continental archipelagos=== \n [[File:\u041e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430_\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0437_\u0422\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0443._Saaret._By_Victor_Belousov._-_panoramio.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Archipelago Sea]] with many islands in southwestern Finland.]] \n Sets of islands formed close to the coast of a continent are considered continental archipelagos when they form part of the same continental shelf, when those islands are above-water extensions of the shelf. The islands of the [[Inside Passage]] off the coast of [[British Columbia]] and the [[Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] are examples. \n \n ===Artificial archipelagos=== \n Artificial archipelagos have been created in various countries for different purposes. [[Palm Islands]] and the [[World Islands]] off Dubai were or are being created for leisure and tourism purposes. < ref > {{cite web | last=McFadden | first=Christopher | title=7+ Amazing Facts About Dubai's Palm Islands | website=Interesting Engineering | date=22 December 2019 | url=https://interestingengineering.com/7-curious-facts-about-dubais-palm-islands | access-date=8 July 2020}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | last=Wainwright | first=Oliver | title=Not the end of The World: the return of Dubai's ultimate folly | website=The Guardian| date=13 February 2018 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/feb/13/not-end-the-world-return-dubai-ultimate-folly | access-date=8 July 2020}} < /ref >  [[Marker Wadden]] in the Netherlands is being built as a conservation area for birds and other wildlife. < ref > {{cite web | last=Boffey | first=Daniel | title=Marker Wadden, the manmade Dutch archipelago where wild birds reign supreme | website=The Guardian| date=27 April 2019 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/27/marker-wadden-islands-netherlands-manmade-archipelago-wild-birds-eco-haven | access-date=8 July 2020}} < /ref > \n \n ==Further examples== \n The largest archipelagic state in the world by area, and by population, is [[Indonesia]]. < ref > {{cite book |title=Indonesia |work=The World Factbook |date=4 December 2008 |url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/indonesia/ |access-date=7 December 2008 |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] of the [[United States]] |location=[[Washington, DC]] }} < /ref > \n < !-- It isn't clear if this 'factoid' should be in this article, or in the [[Indonesia]] article instead. -- > \n \n == See also == \n {{Portal|Geography|Islands}} \n * [[Island arc]] \n * [[List of landforms]] \n * [[List of archipelagos by number of islands]] \n * [[List of archipelagos]] \n * [[Archipelagic state]] \n * [[List of islands]] \n \n == References == \n {{Reflist}} \n \n == External links == \n {{Wiktionary}} \n {{Commons category|Archipelagoes}} \n * {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Archipelago}} \n * [https://web.archive.org/web/20090130062925/http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/featured/island-archipelagos/3612 30 Most Incredible Island Archipelagos] \n \n {{coastal geography}} \n {{Authority control}} \n \n [[Category:Archipelagoes| ]] < !--please leave the empty space as standard-- > \n [[Category:Coastal and oceanic landforms]] \n [[Category:Oceanographical terminology]]"
