He ruled the [[Principality of Halych]] from 1188 until 1189/1190, and again between 1208/1209 and 1210. He was the younger son of [[B\u00e9la III of Hungary]], who entrusted him with the administration of the newly conquered Principality of Halych in 1188. Andrew's rule was unpopular, and the [[boyar]]s (or noblemen) expelled him. B\u00e9la III willed property and money to Andrew, obliging him to lead a [[crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. Instead, Andrew forced his elder brother, King [[Emeric of Hungary]], to cede [[Kingdom of Croatia (1102\u20131526)|Croatia]] and [[Dalmatia]] as an appanage to him in 1197. The following year, Andrew occupied [[Zachlumia|Hum]]. \n \n Despite the fact that Andrew did not stop conspiring against Emeric, the dying king made Andrew guardian of his son, [[Ladislaus III of Hungary|Ladislaus III]], in 1204. After the premature death of Ladislaus, Andrew ascended the throne in 1205. According to historian L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kontler,  \" [i]t was amidst the socio-political turmoil during [Andrew's] reign that the relations, arrangements, institutional framework and social categories that arose under Stephen I, started to disintegrate in the higher echelons of society \"  in Hungary.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=75}} Andrew introduced a new grants policy, the so-called  \" new institutions \" , giving away money and royal estates to his partisans despite the loss of royal revenues. He was the first Hungarian monarch to adopt the title of  \" King of Halych and [[Prince of Vladimir-in-Volhynia|Lodomeria]] \" . He waged at least a dozen wars to seize the two [[Rus' principalities]], but the local [[boyar]]s and neighboring princes prevented him from conquering the principalities. He participated in the [[Fifth Crusade]] to the Holy Land in 1217\u20131218, but the crusade was a failure. \n \n When the ''[[servientes regis]]'', or  \" royal servants \" , rose up, Andrew was forced to issue the [[Golden Bull of 1222]], confirming their privileges. This led to the rise of the [[nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary]]. His ''[[Diploma Andreanum]]'' of 1224 listed the liberties of the [[Transylvanian Saxon]] community. The employment of [[Jews in Hungary|Jews]] and [[B\u00f6sz\u00f6rm\u00e9ny|Muslims]] to administer the royal revenues led him into conflict with the [[Holy See]] and the Hungarian [[prelate]]s. Andrew pledged to respect the privileges of the clergymen and to dismiss his non-Christian officials in 1233, but he never fulfilled the latter promise. \n \n Andrew's first wife, [[Gertrude of Merania]], was murdered in 1213 because her blatant favoritism towards her German kinsmen and courtiers stirred up discontent among the native lords. The veneration of their daughter, [[Elizabeth of Hungary]], was confirmed by the Holy See during Andrew's lifetime. After Andrew's death, his sons, [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|B\u00e9la]] and [[Coloman of Galicia-Lodomeria|Coloman]], accused his third wife, [[Beatrice d'Este, Queen of Hungary|Beatrice d'Este]], of adultery and never considered her son, [[Stephen the Posthumous|Stephen]], to be a legitimate son of Andrew. \n \n ==Early life== \n \n ===Childhood and youth ({{circa}} 1177\u20131197)=== \n \n Andrew was the second son of King [[B\u00e9la III of Hungary|B\u00e9la III]] and B\u00e9la's first wife, [[Agnes of Antioch]].{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|Makk|1996|p=229, Appendix 4}} The year of Andrew's birth is not known, but modern historians agree that he was born around 1177.{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|Makk|1996|p=229, Appendix 4}}{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|1994|p=43}}{{sfn|Alm\u00e1si|2012|p=86}} Andrew was first mentioned in connection to his father's invasion of the [[Principality of Halych]] in 1188.{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|Makk|1996|p=229}} That year, B\u00e9la III invaded Halych upon the request of its former prince, [[Vladimir II Yaroslavich]], who had been expelled by his subjects.{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|Makk|1996|p=229}}{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|p=191}} B\u00e9la forced the new prince, [[Roman Mstislavich]], to flee.
