  "{{short description|Ancient Greek concept}} \n {{about||the geologic time|Geologic time scale|other uses}} \n {{Use British (Oxford) English|date=August 2016}}{{More citations needed|date=June 2009}} \n The word '''aeon''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|i\u02d0|\u0252|n}}, also spelled '''eon''' ([[American English|in American English]]), originally meant  \" life \" ,  \" vital force \"  or  \" being \" ,  \" generation \"  or  \" a period of time \" , though it tended to be translated as  \" age \"  in the sense of   \" ages \" ,  \" forever \" ,  \" timeless \"  or  \" for [[eternity]] \" . It is a [[Latin]] transliteration from the [[koine Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u1f41 [[wikt:\u03b1\u1f30\u03ce\u03bd|\u03b1\u1f30\u03ce\u03bd]]}} (''ho aion''), from the archaic {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f30\u03dd\u03ce\u03bd}}  (''aiwon''). In [[Homer]] it typically refers to life or lifespan. Its latest meaning is more or less similar to the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]'' and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''[[olam (disambiguation)|olam]]''. A [[cognate]] [[Latin language|Latin]]  word ''aevum'' or ''aeuum'' (cf. {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f30\u03dd\u03ce\u03bd}}) for  \" age \"  is present in words such as ''longevity'' and ''mediaeval''. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.pballew.net/arithm16.html|title=Math words page 16|access-date=2006-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618055137/http://pballew.net/arithm16.html|archive-date=2010-06-18|url-status=dead}} < /ref > \n \n Although the term aeon may be used in reference to a period of a billion years (especially in [[geology]], [[cosmology]] and [[astronomy]]), its more common usage is for any long, indefinite period.  Aeon can also refer to the four aeons on the [[geologic time scale]] that make up the Earth's history, the [[Hadean]], [[Archean]], [[Proterozoic]], and the current aeon, [[Phanerozoic]]. \n \n ==Astronomy and cosmology== \n In astronomy an aeon is defined as a billion years (10 < sup > 9 < /sup >  years, abbreviated AE). < ref name=Keel > {{cite book |title=Astrophysical Concepts |edition=2nd |author=Martin Harweit |isbn=3-540-96683-8 |year=1991 |publisher=Springer-Verlag}} p. 4. < /ref > \n   \n [[Roger Penrose]] uses the word ''aeon'' to describe the period between successive and cyclic [[Big Bang]]s within the context of [[conformal cyclic cosmology]]. \n \n ==Philosophy and mysticism== \n {{More citations needed section|date=May 2021}} \n [[Plato]] used the word ''aeon'' to denote the eternal world of ideas, which he conceived was  \" behind \"  the perceived world, as demonstrated in his famous [[allegory of the cave]]. \n \n [[Christianity]]'s idea of  \" [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] \"  comes from the word for life, ''zoe'', and a form of ''aeon'', < ref > {{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/kjvs/genesis/1.htm|title=Genesis Chapter 1 (KJV)}} < /ref >  which could mean life in the next aeon, the [[Kingdom of God]], or [[Heaven]], just as much as immortality, as in {{bibleref2|John|3:16}}. \n \n According to the Christian doctrine of [[universal reconciliation]], the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Greek New Testament]] scriptures use the word  \" aeon \"  to mean a long period (perhaps 1000 years) and the word  \" aeonian \"  to mean  \" during a long period \" ; Thus there was a time before the aeons, and the aeonian period is finite. After each man's mortal life ends, he is judged worthy of aeonian life or aeonian punishment. That is, after the period of the aeons, all punishment will cease and death is overcome and then God becomes the all in each one ({{bibleref2|1Cor|15:28|NKJV}}).  This contrasts with the conventional Christian belief in eternal life and eternal punishment. \n \n [[Occult]]ists of the [[Thelema]] and [[Ordo Templi Orientis|O.T.O.]] traditions sometimes speak of a  \" [[Aeon (Thelema)|magical Aeon]] \"  that may last for far less time, perhaps as little as 2,000 years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} \n \n Aeon may also be an archaic name for omnipotent beings, such as gods. \n \n ===Gnosticism=== \n {{main|Aeon (Gnosticism)}} \n \n In many [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] systems, the various [[emanationism|emanations]] of [[God]], who is also known by such names as the One, the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]], ''Aion teleos'' ({{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f30\u03ce\u03bd \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2}}  \" The Broadest Aeon \" ), [[Bythos]] ( \" depth or profundity \" , Greek {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03c5\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2}}), ''Proarkhe'' ( \" before the beginning \" , Greek {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae}}), the ''Arkhe'' ( \" the beginning \" , Greek {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae}}),  \" Sophia \"  (wisdom), Christos (the Anointed One) are called ''Aeons''. In the different systems these emanations are differently named, classified, and described, but the emanation theory itself is common to all forms of Gnosticism. \n \n In the [[Basilidian]] Gnosis they are called sonships (\u03c5\u1f31\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 ''huiotetes''; sing.: {{lang|grc|\u03c5\u1f31\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2}} ''huiotes''); according to [[Marcosians|Marcus]], they are numbers and sounds; in [[Valentinianism]] they form male/female pairs called  \" syzygies \"  (Greek {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c5\u03b6\u03c5\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03b9}}, from \u03c3\u03cd\u03b6\u03c5\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9 ''syzygoi''). \n \n Similarly, in the Greek Magical Papyri, the term  \" Aion \"  is often used to denote the All, or the supreme aspect of God. < ref > H.
