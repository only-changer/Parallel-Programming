He was the younger brother of [[Cain]], and the younger son of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]], the first couple within the Biblical tale. < ref > {{cite book |title=The Holy Bible |date=2016 |publisher=Crossway Bibles |pages=Genesis 1:26\u201327; Genesis 2:20\u201324 |edition=English Standard Version}} < /ref >  He was a [[shepherd]] who offered his firstborn flock up to God as an offering. God accepted his offering but not his brother's. Cain then killed Abel out of jealousy. \n \n According to Genesis, this was the first murder in the history of mankind. \n \n == Genesis narrative == \n {{Main|Cain and Abel}} \n \n ==Interpretations== \n ===Jewish and Christian interpretations=== \n According to the narrative in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], '''Abel''' ({{Lang-he|\u05d4\u05b6\u05d1\u05b6\u05dc}} ''H\u00e9vel'', in [[pausa]] {{Script/Hebrew|\u05d4\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05dc}} ''H\u0101\u0301\u1e07el''; {{lang-gr|\u1f0d\u03b2\u03b5\u03bb}} ''H\u00e1bel''; {{lang-ar|[[wikt:\u0647\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0644|\u0647\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0644]]}}, ''H\u0101b\u012bl'') is Eve's second son. His name in Hebrew is composed of the same three consonants as a [[Semitic root|root]] meaning  \" breath \" . [[Julius Wellhausen]], have proposed that the name is independent of the root. < ref > [[Julius Wellhausen]], ''Skizzen und Vorarbeiten'', volume 3, (1887), p. 70. < /ref >  [[Eberhard Schrader]] had previously put forward the [[Akkadian (language)|Akkadian]] (Old Assyrian dialect) ''ablu'' ( \" son \" ) as a more likely etymology. < ref > [[Eberhard Schrader]], ''Die Keilinschrift und das Alte Testament'', 1872. < /ref > \n [[File:William Bouguereau - El primer duelo.jpg|thumb|right| ''[[The First Mourning]]'' (Adam and Eve mourn the death of Abel); oil on canvas 1888 painting by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] ]] \n In [[Christianity]], comparisons are sometimes made between the death of Abel and that of [[Jesus]], the former thus seen as being the first martyr. In {{Bibleref2|Matthew|23:35}} Jesus speaks of Abel as  \" righteous \" , and the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] states that  \" The blood of sprinkling ... [speaks] better things than that of Abel \"  ({{Bibleref2|Hebrews|12:24}}). The blood of Jesus is interpreted as bringing mercy; but that of Abel as demanding vengeance (hence the curse and mark). < ref > For copies of a spectrum of notable translations and commentaries see [http://bible.cc/hebrews/12-24.htm Hebrews 12:24] at the Online Parallel Bible. < /ref > \n \n Abel is invoked in the [[litany]] for the dying in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and his sacrifice is mentioned in the [[Canon of the Mass]] along with those of [[Abraham]] and [[Melchizedek]]. The [[Alexandrian Rite]] commemorates him with a [[feast day]] on December 28. < ref > [[Frederick George Holweck|Holweck, F. G.]], ''A Biographical Dictionary of the Saints''. St. Louis, MO: B. Herder Book Co., 1924. < /ref > \n \n According to the Coptic [[Book of Adam and Eve]] (at 2:1\u201315), and the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Cave of Treasures]], Abel's body, after many days of mourning, was placed in the ''Cave of Treasures'', before which Adam and Eve, and descendants, offered their prayers. In addition, the [[Seth]]ite line of the [[Generations of Adam]] swear by Abel's blood to segregate themselves from the ''unrighteous''. \n \n In the [[Book of Enoch]] (22:7), regarded by most Christian and Jewish traditions as extra-biblical, the soul of Abel is described as having been appointed as the chief of martyrs, crying for vengeance, for the destruction of the seed of Cain. This view is later repeated in the [[Testament of Abraham]] (A:13 / B:11), where Abel has been raised to the position as the judge of the souls. \n \n ===Islamic interpretation=== \n [[File:NabiHabeel02.JPG|thumb|Grave of Abel within the [[Nabi Habeel Mosque]]]] \n {{Main|Cain and Abel in Islam|Al-Ma'ida}} \n [[File:NabiHabeel01.jpg|thumb|The [[Mausoleum]] of Abel in the [[Nabi Habeel Mosque]]]] \n According to [[Shia Islam|Shi'a Muslim]] belief, Abel ('' \" Habeel \" '') is buried in the [[Nabi Habeel Mosque]], located on the west mountains of [[Damascus]], near the [[Zabadani]] Valley, overlooking the villages of the [[Barada]] river (Wadi Barada), in [[Syria]]. Shi'a are frequent visitors of this mosque for [[ziyarat]]. The mosque was built by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Wali]] Ahmad Pasha in 1599. \n \n == Notes == \n {{notelist}} \n \n == References == \n {{Reflist}} \n \n {{Cain and Abel}} \n {{Adam and Eve}} \n {{Adam to David}} \n {{Authority control}} \n \n [[Category:Cain and Abel| ]] \n [[Category:Bereshit (parashah)]] \n [[Category:Biblical murder victims]] \n [[Category:Book of Genesis people]] \n [[Category:Children of Adam and Eve]] \n [[Category:Male murder victims]]"
