Acapulco was the eastern end of the trans-Pacific sailing route from Acapulco to [[Manila]], in what was then a Spanish colony. \n \n == History == \n {{See also|Timeline of Acapulco}} \n \n === Pre-Columbian === \n [[File:Puerto de Acapulco Boot 1628.png|left|thumb|A 1628 relief atlas of [[Acapulco Bay]]]] \n By the 8th century around the [[Acapulco Bay]] area, there was a small culture which would first be dominated by the [[Olmec]]s, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period before it ended in the 1520s. At Acapulco Bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by [[Playa Larga]] and the other on a hill known as ''El Guitarr\u00f3n''. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers. < ref name= \" encmuc \"  / > \n \n Later, [[Teotihuacan]] influence made its way here via [[Cuernavaca]] and Chilpancingo. Then [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] influence arrived from the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] and through what is now [[Oaxaca]]. This history is known through the archaeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at ''Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta'', and ''Tambuco''. < ref name= \" encmuc \"  / > \n \n In the 11th century, new waves of migration of [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]] and ''Coixas'' came through here. These people were the antecedents of the [[Aztec]]s. In the later 15th century, after four years of military struggle, Acapulco became part of the [[Aztec Empire]] during the reign of [[Ahuizotl]] (1486\u20131502). It was annexed to a tributary province named ''Tepecuacuilco''. However, this was only transitory, as the Aztecs could only establish an unorganized military post at the city's outskirts. The city was in territory under control of the ''Yopes'', who continued defending it and living there until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s. < ref name= \" encmuc \"  / > < ref > Cabrera Guerrero, Martha Eugenia, 1990, ''Los pobladores prehisp\u00e1nicos de Acapulco'', INAH, {{ISBN|968-6487-44-1}} < /ref > \n \n === 16th century === \n [[File:Yope Acapulco.png|left|thumb|[[Codex Tudela]]:  \" Acapulco's Yope Indian, at the South Sea \" ]][[File:Carl Saltzmann - View of Acapulco, 1879.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2| alt=Painting of a sandy beach, sun setting behind it, seen from the water.

The first states that two years after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cer\u00f3n was authorized by Cort\u00e9s to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on December 13, 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara. < ref name= \" encmuc \"  / > \n The first [[encomendero]] was established in 1525 at ''Cacahuatepec'', which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably '''Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte''', left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of ''Cuautepec''. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn. < ref name= \" encmuc \"  / > \n \n Cort\u00e9s established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqu\u00e9s, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an  \" alcadia \"  (major province or town). < ref name= \" encmuc \"  / > \n \n Spanish trade in the Far East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of [[New Spain]]. In 1550 thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents. < ref name= \" encmuc \"  / >  Galleons started arriving in Acapulco from Asia by 1565. Acapulco would become the second most important port, after [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon]] trade, which was the nexus of all kinds of communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade. < ref name= \" apiacapulco \"  / > \n \n === 17th\u201319th centuries === \n [[File:Hasekura in Rome.JPG|thumb|[[Hasekura Tsunenaga]]; the Japanese samurai who led the delegation to Mexico]] \n [[File:JLNYCAcapulcoBay.jpg|thumb|[[Puerto Marqu\u00e9s]]]] \n On January 25, 1614, a delegation led by [[samurai]] [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]], which included over one hundred [[Japanese Christians]] as well as twenty-two samurai under the [[sh\u014dgun]] [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], arrived from [[Japan]] to Acapulco as part of a mission to form closer relations with [[Catholic]] Europe. A fight soon broke out in which a Japanese samurai stabbed a Spanish colonial soldier in Acapulco. This was witnessed and recorded by historian [[Chimalpahin]], who was the grandson of an [[Aztec]] nobleman. Some of Tsunenaga's delegation would stay and marry with the locals. < ref > {{cite web |title=The Unknown Story of the Samurai Who Traveled to Mexico Hundreds of Years Ago |url=https://curiosmos.com/the-unknown-story-of-the-samurai-who-traveled-to-mexico-hundreds-of-years-ago/ |website=Curiosmos |access-date=19 April 2021 |date=10 February 2020}} < /ref > \n \n The [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon|galleon trade]] made its yearly run from the mid-16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch [[pirates]], such as [[Francis Drake]], [[Henry Morgan]] and [[Thomas Cavendish]], who called it  \" The Black Ship \" . A Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town before being driven off. The [[Fort of San Diego]] was built the following year to protect the port and the cargo of arriving ships. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt between 1778 and 1783. \n \n At the beginning of the 19th century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, not long after, the [[Mexican War of Independence]] began. In 1810, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos y Pav\u00f3n]] attacked and burnt down the city, after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Par\u00e9s at the Battle of Tres Palos. < ref name= \" encmuc \"  / >  The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon. \n Acapulco's importance as a port recovered during the [[California Gold Rush]] in the mid-19th-century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here. This city was the besieged on 19 April 1854 by [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] after Guerrero's leadership had rebelled by issuing the [[Plan of Ayutla|Plan de Ayutla]]. After an unsuccessful week of fighting, Santa Anna retreated. < ref > Fowler, Will (2007). ''Santa Anna of Mexico''.

It is the area that presents the most tourist influx in the port, runs through much of the Acapulco bay, from Icacos, passing through Costera Miguel Aleman Avenue, which is the main one, to Papagayo Park. It has several hotels, \n \n Acapulco Diamante, also known as Punta Diamante, is the newest and most developed part of the port, with investment having created one of the greatest concentrations of luxury facilities in Mexico, including exclusive hotels and resorts of international chains, residential complexes, luxury condominiums and private villas, spas, restaurants, shopping areas and a golf course. Starting at the Scenic Highway in Las Brisas, it includes Puerto Marqu\u00e9s and Punta Diamante and extends to Barra Vieja Beach. It is 10 minutes from the Acapulco International Airport. In this area, all along ''Boulevard de las Naciones'', almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart. < ref name= \" salvar \"  / > \n \n Acapulco's reputation of a high-energy party town and the nightlife have long been draws of the city for tourists. From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the [[MS Queen Victoria|MS ''Queen Victoria'']], the [[MS Rotterdam|MS ''Rotterdam'']], ''[[Crystal Harmony]]'', and all the Princess line ships.

Some consider it a ''pass\u00e9'' resort, eclipsed by the newer [[Canc\u00fan]] and [[Cabo San Lucas]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Over the years, a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches, who offer everything from newspapers to massages, are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach, but the government says it is difficult to eradicate, as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty in the city. < ref name= \" ambulantaje \" > {{cite news |title= Combaten ambulantaje en Acapulco |first=Alfonso |last=Juarez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=December 30, 2009 |page=12 |language=es |trans-title=Combating wandering vendors in Acapulco }} < /ref >  Around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come to the city looking for work. In the last decade, drug-related violence has caused massive problems for the local tourism trade. \n \n Another problem is the garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby [[Zihuatanejo]], more needs to be done. Most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common in the city to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires. < ref name= \" limpiar \" > {{cite news |title= Buscan en Guerrero limpiar fondo de mar |first=Alfonso |last=Juarez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=December 28, 2009 |page=8 |language=es |trans-title=Seeking to clean the bottom of the sea in Guerrero }} < /ref >   Acapulco has seen some success in this area, having several beaches receiving the high  \" blue flag \"  certifications for cleanliness and water quality. < ref > {{cite web |title=Blue Flag |url=https://www.blueflag.global/ |website=Blue Flag |publisher=Foundation for Environmental Education |access-date=15 June 2020}} < /ref > \n \n === Gastronomy === \n Acapulco's gastronomy is very rich. The following are typical dishes from the region: \n '''Relleno''' is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes, raisins, carrots and chiles. It is eaten with bread called ''bolillo''. \n '''Pozole''' is a soup with a salsa base (it can be white, red or green), corn, meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with ''antojitos'' (snacks) like tostadas, tacos and tamales.

In the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government-subsidized 'Colectivo' cab system. These cabs cost 13 [[Mexican peso|pesos]] per person to ride,{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first-come, first-served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs travel mainly to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, where most of the hotels for visitors are located, but which includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day. \n \n The bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form, other than walking, in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have air conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decals and home-made interior designs that range from comic book scenes, to pornography, and even to  \" [[Hello Kitty]] \"  themes.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} \n \n The conflictive public transportation would be upgraded the 25th of June 2016 with the implementation of the Acabus. The Acabus infrastructure has a length of {{convert|36.2|km|abbr=off}}, counts with 16 stations that spread through the city of Acapulco and 5 routes. This project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers. < ref > [[:es:Acab\u00fas]].

The nomination will be made jointly with Mexico. \n \n The following are the experts and the topics they discussed during the roundtable meeting: Dr. Celestina Boncan on the Tornaviaje; Dr. Mary Jane A. Bolunia on Shipyards in the Bicol Region; Mr. Sheldon Clyde Jago-on, Bobby Orillaneda, and Ligaya Lacsina on Underwater Archaeology; Dr. Leovino Garcia on Maps and Cartography; Fr. Rene Javellana, S.J. on Fortifications in the Philippines; Felice Sta. Maria on Food; Dr. Fernando Zialcita on Textile; and Regalado Trota Jose on Historical Dimension. The papers presented and discussed during the roundtable meeting will be synthesized into a working document to establish the route's Outstanding Universal Value. < ref name= \" gov.ph \" > {{cite news |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2015/04/28/ph-mexico-push-to-nominate-manila-acapulco-galleon-trade-route-to-world-heritage-list/ |title=PH, Mexico push to nominate Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route to World Heritage List |newspaper=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |date=28 April 2015 |access-date=14 December 2017}} {{PD-notice}} < /ref > \n \n The Mexican side reiterated that they will also follow suit with the preparations for the route's nomination. \n \n Spain has also backed the nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Trade Route Route in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] list and has also suggested the Archives of the Manila-Acapulco Galleons to be nominated as part of a separate UNESCO list, the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Register]]. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/05/1473367/spain-backs-inclusion-galleon-trade-route-world-heritage-list |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214072025/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/05/1473367/spain-backs-inclusion-galleon-trade-route-world-heritage-list |archive-date=December 14, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}} < /ref > \n \n {| class= \" wikitable \"  style= \" font-size:95%; background:#fdfdfd; \" \n |- \n ! scope= \" col \"  style= \" background:#ffdead; \" | Type {{small|(criteria)}} \n ! scope= \" col \"  style= \" background:#ffdead; width:12.5em; \" | Site \n ! scope= \" col \"  style= \" background:#ffdead; \" | Location \n ! scope= \" col \"  style= \" background:#ffdead; \" | Description \n ! scope= \" col \"  style= \" background:#ffdead; \" | Image \n ! scope= \" col \"  style= \" background:#ffdead; \" | {{abbr|Ref|Reference(s)}} \n |- style= \" vertical-align:top; \" \n ! scope= \" row \"  | Mixed \n | style= \" font-weight:bold; \"  | The Historic [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade|Manila{{nbhyph}}Acapulco Galleon Trade]] Route \n | [[Philippines]] {{small|and}} [[Mexico]] \n |  < !-- Description -- > \n | [[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumb|right|250px|White represents the route of the Manila Galleons in the Pacific]] \n | < ref name= \" gov.ph \" / > \n |} \n \n == See also == \n {{Portal|Mexico}} \n * [[Acapulco (municipality)]] \n * [[Triangle of the Sun]] \n \n == References == \n {{Reflist}} \n \n == Bibliography == \n {{See also|Timeline of Acapulco#Bibliography|l1=Bibliography of the history of Acapulco}} \n \n == External links == \n {{Wikivoyage|Acapulco}} \n {{Commons category|Acapulco}} \n * {{Official website|http://www.acapulco.gob.mx|Official city government website}} {{in lang|es}} \n \n {{Guerrero}} \n {{Authority control}} \n \n [[Category:Acapulco| ]] < !--please leave the empty space as standard-- > \n [[Category:1550 establishments in the Spanish Empire]] \n [[Category:Populated coastal places in Mexico]] \n [[Category:Beaches of Guerrero]] \n [[Category:Populated places established in 1550]] \n [[Category:Populated places in Guerrero]] \n [[Category:Port cities and towns on the Mexican Pacific coast]] \n [[Category:Seaside resorts in Mexico]]"
