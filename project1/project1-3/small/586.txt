It is the second-largest [[lusophone]] ([[List of territorial entities where Portuguese is an official language|Portuguese-speaking]]) country in both total area and [[List of countries and dependencies by population|population]] (behind [[Brazil]]), and it is the [[List of African countries by area|seventh-largest]] country in [[Africa]], bordered by [[Namibia]] to the south, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north, [[Zambia]] to the east, and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. Angola has an [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] province, the province of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] that borders the [[Republic of the Congo]] and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The capital and largest city is [[Luanda]]. \n \n Angola has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic Age]]. Its formation as a nation-state originates from [[European exploration of Africa|Portuguese colonisation]], which initially began with coastal settlements and [[trading post]]s founded in the 16th century. In the 19th century, European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior. The [[Portuguese Angola|Portuguese colony]] that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century, owing to resistance by native groups such as the Cuamato, the [[Oukwanyama|Kwanyama]] and the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]]. \n \n After a protracted [[Angolan War of Independence|anti-colonial struggle]], Angola achieved independence in 1975 as a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] [[People's Republic of Angola|one-party Republic]]. The country descended into a devastating [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] the same year, between the ruling [[MPLA|People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA), backed by the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]], and the insurgent anti-communist [[UNITA|National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA), supported by the [[United States]] and [[South Africa]]. The country has been governed by MPLA ever since its independence in 1975. Following the end of the war in 2002, Angola emerged as a relatively stable [[Unitary state|unitary]], [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[Republic|constitutional republic]]. \n \n Angola has vast [[Mineral resource estimation|mineral]] and [[Oil reserves|petroleum reserves]], and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world, especially since the end of the civil war. However, economic growth is highly uneven, with most of the nation's [[Distribution of wealth#Wealth concentration|wealth concentrated]] in a disproportionately small sector of the population. < ref > {{Cite web|date=13 April 2010|title=Transparency and Accountability in Angola|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/04/13/transparency-and-accountability-angola|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006051053/http://www.hrw.org/report/2010/04/13/transparency-and-accountability-angola|archive-date=6 October 2015|access-date=1 April 2016|website=Human Rights Watch}} < /ref >  The [[standard of living]] remains low for most Angolans; [[life expectancy]] is among the lowest in the world, while [[infant mortality]] is among the highest. < ref > {{cite web|title=Life expectancy at birth|year=2014|work=World Fact Book|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|access-date=4 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120024054/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|archive-date=20 January 2016|url-status=live}} < /ref >   \n Since 2017, the government of Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o has made fighting corruption its flagship, so much so that many individuals of the previous government are either jailed or awaiting trial.

As of 2019, the Angolan population is estimated at 31.83 million. Angola is multicultural and multiethnic.

Cabinda borders the [[Congo Republic]] to the north and north-northeast and the DRC to the east and south. The town of Cabinda is the chief population centre. \n \n According to a 1995 census, Cabinda had an estimated population of 600,000, approximately 400,000 of whom live in neighbouring countries. Population estimates are, however, highly unreliable. Consisting largely of tropical forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber and palm oil. \n \n The product for which it is best known, however, is its oil, which has given it the nickname,  \" the Kuwait of Africa \" . Cabinda's petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of Angola's output. < ref > {{cite news|date=22 December 2013|title=Angola profile|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13036732|url-status=live|access-date=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624084435/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13036732|archive-date=24 June 2018}} < /ref >  Most of the oil along its coast was discovered under [[Portuguese Angola|Portuguese rule]] by the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (CABGOC) from 1968 onwards. \n \n Ever since [[Portugal]] handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of Angola to the local independence groups (MPLA, UNITA and FNLA), the territory of Cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the [[Government of Angola]] (which has employed its armed forces, the FAA\u2014For\u00e7as Armadas Angolanas) and Cabindan separatists. The [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]]-[[For\u00e7as Armadas de Cabinda|Armed Forces of Cabinda]] (FLEC-FAC) announced the virtual Federal Republic of Cabinda under the Presidency of N'Zita Henriques Tiago. One of the characteristics of the Cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation, into smaller and smaller factions. \n \n == Government and politics == \n {{more citations needed|section|date=November 2020}} < !--several subsections with no or few footnotes-- > \n {{Main|Politics of Angola}} \n {{See also|Elections in Angola|List of political parties in Angola}} \n [[File:National Assembly Building (19898889148).jpg|thumb|left|The [[National Assembly of Angola]].]] \n The Angolan government is composed of three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial.

The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary laws, but it is weak and fragmented. There are only 12 courts in more than 140 counties in the country. Its first task was the validation of the candidacies of the political parties to the legislative elections of 5 September 2008.
