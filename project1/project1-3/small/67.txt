[[Pepi I]] ([[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]]) constructed a funerary chapel which evolved over the years into the Great Temple of [[Osiris]], the ruins of which still exist within the town enclosure. Abydos became the centre of the worship of the [[Isis]] and Osiris cult. \n \n During the [[First Intermediate Period]], the principal deity of the area, Khentiamentiu, began to be seen as an aspect of Osiris, and the deities gradually merged and came to be regarded as one. Khentiamentiu's name became an [[epithet]] of Osiris. King [[Mentuhotep II]] was the first to build a [[Mahat chapel of Nebhetepre Mentuhotep II|royal chapel]]. In the [[twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] a gigantic tomb was cut into the rock by [[Senusret III]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=81}} Associated with this tomb was a [[cenotaph]], a cult temple and a small town known as  \" [[Wah-Sut]] \" , that was used by the workers for these structures. < ref name= \" bvzwvt \" > Harvey, EA24, p.3 < /ref >  Next to the cenotaph at least two kings of the [[Thirteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirteenth Dynasty]] were buried  (in tombs [[S 9 (Abydos)|S9]] and [[S 10 (Abydos)|S10]]) as well as some rulers of the [[Second Intermediate Period]], such as [[Senebkay]]. An indigenous line of kings, the [[Abydos Dynasty]], may have ruled the region from Abydos at the time. \n \n New construction during the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] began with a large chapel of [[Ahmose I]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}} The [[Pyramid of Ahmose]] I was also constructed at Abydos\u2014the only pyramid in the area; very little of it remains today. \n \n [[Thutmose III]] built a far larger temple, about {{convert|130|x|200|ft|m|abbr=on}}. He also made a processional way leading past the side of the temple to the cemetery beyond, featuring a great gateway of granite.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}} \n \n [[Seti I]], during the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]], founded a temple to the south of the town in honor of the ancestral pharaohs of the early dynasties; this was finished by [[Ramesses II]], who also built a lesser temple of his own.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=81}} [[Merneptah]] added the [[Osireion]], just to the north of the temple of Seti. < ref name= \" bvzwvt \"  / > \n \n [[Ahmose II]] in the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty]] rebuilt the temple again, and placed in it a large monolith shrine of red granite, finely wrought.

A tradition developed that the [[Umm el-Qa'ab|Early Dynastic cemetery]] was the burial place of Osiris and the tomb of [[Djer]] was reinterpreted as that of Osiris. < ref > O'Connor, David (2009).

The first was an enclosure, about {{convert|30|x|50|ft|m|abbr=on}}, enclosed by a thin wall of unbaked bricks. Incorporating one wall of this first structure, the second temple of about {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} square was built with walls about {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} thick. An outer ''[[temenos]]'' (enclosure) wall surrounded the grounds. This outer wall was made wider some time around the Second or [[Third dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]]. The old temple entirely vanished in the Fourth Dynasty, and a smaller building was erected behind it, enclosing a wide hearth of black ashes. Pottery models of offerings are found in these ashes and were probably the substitutes for live sacrifices decreed by [[Khufu (pharaoh)|Khufu]] (or Cheops) in his temple reforms.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=81-82}} \n \n At an undetermined date, a great clearance of temple offerings had been made and the modern discovery of a chamber into which they were gathered yielded the fine ivory carvings and the glazed figures and tiles that demonstrate the splendid work of the First Dynasty. A vase of [[Menes]] with purple [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] inlaid into a green glaze and tiles with relief figures are the most important pieces found. The [[Khufu Statuette]] in ivory, found in the stone chamber of the temple, gives the only portrait of this great pharaoh.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}} \n \n The temple was entirely rebuilt on a larger scale by [[Pepi I Meryre|Pepi I]] in the [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]]. He placed a great stone gateway to the ''temenos'', an outer wall and gateway, with a colonnade between the gates. His temple was about {{convert|40|x|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} inside, with stone gateways front and back, showing that it was of the processional type. In the [[Eleventh dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]] [[Mentuhotep I]] added a colonnade and altars. Soon after, [[Mentuhotep II]] entirely rebuilt the temple, laying a stone pavement over the area, about {{convert|45|ft|m|abbr=on}} square. He also added subsidiary chambers. Soon thereafter, in the Twelfth Dynasty, [[Senusret I]] laid massive foundations of stone over the pavement of his predecessor. A great ''temenos'' was laid out enclosing a much larger area and the new temple itself was about three times the earlier size.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}} \n \n === Brewery === \n On 14 February 2021, Egyptian and American archaeologists discovered what could be the oldest brewery in the world dating from around 3100 BCE at the reign of King [[Narmer]].

This surviving building is best known as the Great Temple of Abydos, being nearly complete and an impressive sight.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}} A principal purpose of the temple was to serve as a memorial to king Seti I, as well as to show reverence for the early pharaohs, which is incorporated within as part of the  \" Rite of the Ancestors \" . \n \n The long list of the pharaohs of the principal dynasties\u2014recognized by Seti\u2014are carved on a wall and known as the  \" [[Abydos King List]] \"  (showing the [[cartouche]] name of many dynastic pharaohs of Egypt from the first, [[Narmer]] or [[Menes]], until Seti's time). There were significant names deliberately left off of the list.

These included three chapels for the  \" state \"  deities [[Ptah]], [[Re-Horakhty]], and (centrally positioned) [[Amun]] and the challenge for the Abydos triad of Osiris, Isis and Horus. The rites recorded in the deity chapels represent the first complete form known of the Daily Ritual, which was performed daily in temples across Egypt throughout the pharaonic period. At the back of the temple is an enigmatic structure known as the [[Osireion]], which served as a cenotaph for Seti-Osiris, and is thought to be connected with the worship of [[Osiris]] as an  \" Osiris tomb \" . < ref > Caulfield, ''Temple of the Kings'' < /ref >   It is possible that from those chambers was led out the great Hypogeum for the celebration of the Osiris mysteries, built by Merenptah. < ref > Murray, ''The Osireion at Abydos'' < /ref >  The temple was originally {{convert|550|ft|m|abbr=on}} long, but the forecourts are scarcely recognizable, and the part still in good condition is about \n {{convert|250|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|350|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, including the wing at the side.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}}  Magazines for food and offerings storage were built to either side of the forecourts, as well as a small palace for the king and his retinue, to the southeast of the first forecourt (Ghazouli, The Palace and Magazines Attached to the Temple of Sety I at Abydos and the Facade of This Temple. ASAE 58 (1959)). \n \n Except for the list of pharaohs and a [[panegyric]] on [[Ramesses II]], the subjects are not historical, but religious in nature, dedicated to the transformation of the king after his death. The temple reliefs are celebrated for their delicacy and artistic refinement, utilizing both the archaism of earlier dynasties with the vibrancy of late 18th Dynasty reliefs. The sculptures had been published mostly in hand copy, not facsimile, by [[Auguste Mariette]] in his ''Abydos'', I.  The temple has been partially recorded epigraphically by Amice Calverley and Myrtle Broome in their 4 volume publication of ''The Temple of King Sethos I at Abydos'' (1933\u20131958). \n \n ==== Osireion ==== \n {{Main| Osireion}} \n The Osirion or Osireon is an ancient Egyptian temple.

Many hundreds of funeral steles were removed by [[Auguste Mariette]]'s workmen, without any details of the burials being noted. < ref > Mariette, ''Abydos'', ii. and iii. < /ref >  Later excavations have been recorded by [[Edward R. Ayrton]], Abydos, iii.; Maclver, ''El Amrah and Abydos''; and [[Garstang]], ''El Arabah''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}} \n \n ===  \" Forts \"  === \n Some of the tomb structures, referred to as  \" forts \"  by modern researchers, lay behind the town. Known as [[Shunet ez Zebib]], it is about {{convert|450|x|250|ft|m|abbr=on}} over all, and one still stands {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} high. It was built by [[Khasekhemwy]], the last pharaoh of the Second Dynasty. Another structure nearly as large adjoined it, and probably is older than that of Khasekhemwy. A third  \" fort \"  of a squarer form is now occupied by a convent of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]; its age cannot be ascertained. < ref > Ayrton, Abydos, iii. < /ref > {{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=82}} \n \n === Kom El Sultan === \n {{Main| Kom El Sultan}} \n The area now known as Kom El Sultan is a big mudbrick structure, the purpose of which is not clear and thought to have been at the original settlement area, dated to the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic Period]]. The structure includes the early temple of [[Osiris]]. \n \n == See also == \n {{Portal|Ancient Egypt}} \n * [[List of ancient Egyptian towns and cities]] \n * [[S 9 (Abydos)]] \n * [[S 10 (Abydos)]] \n * [[Mahat chapel of Mentuhotep II]] \n \n == Notes == \n {{Reflist}} \n \n == References == \n * {{EB1911|wstitle=Abydos (Egypt)|display=Abydos|volume=1|pages=81\u201382}} \n * {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NF0LAAAAIAAJ |last=Ayrton |first=Edward Russell |author2=William Matthew Flinders Petrie |title=Abydos |volume=iii |publisher=Offices of the Egypt Exploration Fund |year=1904}} \n * {{cite journal |title=New Evidence at Abydos for Ahmose's funerary cult |last=Harvey| first=Stephen |publisher=EES |journal=Egyptian Archaeology |volume=24 |date=Spring 2004}} \n * {{cite book |last=Murray |first=Margaret Alice |author2=Joseph Grafton Milne|author3=Walter Ewing Crum |title=The Osireion at Abydos|volume=ii. and iii. |publisher=B.
