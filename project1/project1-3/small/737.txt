In the aged and children, pain might not be the main presenting feature; the aged patient simply moves less, the infantile patient refuses to use the affected limb. \n \n Elements of the history of the disorder guide diagnosis. Important features are speed and time of onset, pattern of joint involvement, symmetry of symptoms, early morning stiffness, tenderness, gelling or locking with inactivity, aggravating and relieving factors, and other systemic symptoms. Physical examination may confirm the diagnosis, or may indicate systemic disease. Radiographs are often used to follow progression or help assess severity. \n \n [[Blood test]]s and [[X-ray]]s of the affected joints often are performed to make the diagnosis.

It can affect both the larger and the smaller joints of the body. In humans, this included the hands, [[wrist osteoarthritis|wrists]], feet, back, hip, and knee. In dogs, this includes the elbow, hip, stifle (knee), shoulder, and back. The disease is essentially one acquired from daily wear and tear of the joint; however, osteoarthritis can also occur as a result of injury.  Osteoarthritis begins in the cartilage and eventually causes the two opposing bones to erode into each other. The condition starts with minor pain during physical activity, but soon the pain can be continuous and even occur while in a state of rest. The pain can be debilitating and prevent one from doing some activities. In dogs, this pain can significantly affect quality of life and may include difficulty going up and down stairs, struggling to get up after lying down, trouble walking on slick floors, being unable to hop in and out of vehicles, difficulty jumping on and off furniture, and behavioral changes (e.g., aggression, difficulty squatting to toilet). < ref > {{Cite web|title=Osteoarthritis in Dogs {{!}} American College of Veterinary Surgeons - ACVS|url=https://www.acvs.org/small-animal/osteoarthritis-in-dogs|access-date=2021-04-06|website=www.acvs.org|language=en}} < /ref >  Osteoarthritis typically affects the weight-bearing joints, such as the back, knee and hip.

Bone continuously undergoes remodeling by actions of bone resorbing [[osteoclast]]s and bone forming [[osteoblast]]s. One of the main triggers of bone erosion in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the [[synovium]], caused in part by the production of pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]]s and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a cell surface protein present in Th17 cells and osteoblasts. < ref name= \" Chabaud_2000 \" > {{cite journal|vauthors=Chabaud M, Garnero P, Dayer JM, Guerne PA, Fossiez F, Miossec P|year=2000|title=Contribution of interleukin 17 to synovium matrix destruction in rheumatoid arthritis|journal=Cytokine|volume=12|issue=7|pages=1092\u20139|doi=10.1006/cyto.2000.0681|pmid=10880256}} < /ref >  Osteoclast activity can be directly induced by osteoblasts through the RANK/RANKL mechanism. < ref name= \" pmid21464945 \" > {{cite journal |vauthors=Won HY, Lee JA, Park ZS, Song JS, Kim HY, Jang SM, Yoo SE, Rhee Y, Hwang ES, Bae MA | title = Prominent bone loss mediated by RANKL and IL-17 produced by CD4+ T cells in TallyHo/JngJ mice | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = e18168 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21464945 | pmc = 3064589 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0018168 | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...618168W }} < /ref > \n \n ===Lupus=== \n {{main|Lupus erythematosus}} \n [[Lupus erythematosus|Lupus]] is a common [[collagen]] [[vascular]] disorder that can be present with severe arthritis.

Exercise often focuses on improving muscle strength, endurance and flexibility. In some cases, exercises may be designed to train balance. Occupational therapy can provide assistance with activities.
