In particular, learning mastery (the degree to which people perceive their lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, [[self-efficacy]], independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety. That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, with higher levels of anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences. < ref > {{cite

Psychopharmacological treatment can be used in parallel to CBT or can be used alone. As a general rule, most anxiety disorders respond well to first-line agents. Such drugs, also used as anti-depressants, are the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s and [[Serotonin\u2013norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]], that work by blocking the reuptake of specific neurotransmitters and resulting in the increase in availability of these neurotransmitters. Additionally,  Benzodiazepines are often prescribed to individuals with anxiety disorder. Benzodiazepines produce an anxiolytic response by modulating GABA and increasing its receptor binding. A third common treatment involves a category of drug known as serotonin agonists. This category of drug works by initiating a physiological response at 5-HT1A receptor by increasing the action of serotonin at this receptor. < ref > {{Cite journal|date=August 2014|title=Introduction of Presentations, ICCSE2014|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iccse.2014.6926415|journal=2014 9th International Conference on Computer Science  &  Education|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/iccse.2014.6926415|isbn=978-1-4799-2951-1}} < /ref >  Other treatment options include pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants, and moclobemide, among others. < ref > Bandelow B, Michaelis S, Wedekind D.

Peripherally, the [[autonomic nervous system]], especially the sympathetic nervous system, mediates many of the symptoms.
