The Light-elves are fairer to look upon than the sun, but the Dark-elves are blacker than pitch. \n < /blockquote > \n The account later, in speaking of a hall in the Highest Heaven called [[Giml\u00e9]] that shall survive when heaven and earth have died, explains: \n < blockquote > It is said that another heaven is to the southward and upward of this one, and it is called [[Andlang]] [''Andlangr'' 'Endlong'] but the third heaven is yet above that, and it is called [[V\u00eddbl\u00e1in]] [''V\u00eddbl\u00e1inn'' 'Wide-blue'] and in that heaven we think this abode is. But we believe that none but Light-Elves inhabit these mansions now. < /blockquote > \n It is not indicated whether these heavens are identical to \u00c1lfheim or distinct. Some texts read Vindbl\u00e1in (''Vindbl\u00e1inn'' 'Wind-blue') instead of V\u00eddbl\u00e1in. \n \n Modern commentators speculate (or sometimes state as fact) that \u00c1lfheim was one of the nine worlds (''heima'') mentioned in stanza & nbsp;2 of the eddic poem ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]''. \n \n ==See also== \n * [[Fairyland]] \n * [[Svart\u00e1lfar | Svart\u00e1lfar (black elves)]] \n \n ==Sources== \n {{Reflist}} \n \n {{Elves}} \n {{Freyr}} \n {{Norse cosmology}} \n \n {{DEFAULTSORT:Alfheim}} \n [[Category:Locations in Norse mythology]] \n [[Category:Saga locations]] \n [[Category:Elves]] \n [[Category:Freyr]] \n \n \n {{Norse-myth-stub}} \n {{saga-stub}}"
