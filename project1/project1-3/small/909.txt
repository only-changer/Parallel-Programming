It was designed by [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]], and is considered one of his masterpieces. A remodel of a previously built house, it was redesigned in 1904 by Gaud\u00ed and has been refurbished several times after that. Gaud\u00ed's assistants [[Dom\u00e8nec Sugra\u00f1es i Gras]], Josep Canaleta and [[Joan Rubi\u00f3]] also contributed to the renovation project. \n \n The local name for the building is ''Casa dels ossos'' (House of Bones), as it has a [[viscera]]l, [[skeleton|skeletal]] organic quality. It is located on the [[Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia]] in the [[Eixample]] district, and forms part of a row of houses known as the ''[[Illa de la Disc\u00f2rdia]]''  (or ''Mansana de la Disc\u00f2rdia'', the  \" Block of Discord \" ), which consists of four buildings by noted ''[[Modernisme|Modernista]]'' architects of Barcelona. < ref name= \" hughes \" > {{cite book |last1=Hughes |first1=Robert |title=Barcelona |date=2001 |publisher=Harvill Press |isbn=9781860468247 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJd9esHdz5YC & q=Illa%20de%20la%20Disc%C3%B2rdia & pg=PA408 |access-date=11 June 2019 |language=en}} < /ref > \n \n Like everything Gaud\u00ed designed, Casa Batll\u00f3 is only identifiable as [[Modernisme]] or [[Art Nouveau]] in the broadest sense. The ground floor, in particular, has unusual [[tracery]], irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work. There are few straight lines, and much of the [[fa\u00e7ade]] is decorated with a colorful [[mosaic]] made of broken ceramic tiles ([[trencad\u00eds]]). The roof is [[arch]]ed and was likened to the back of a [[European dragon|dragon]] or [[dinosaur]]. A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the lance of [[Saint George]] (patron saint of [[Catalonia]], Gaud\u00ed's home), which has been plunged into the back of the dragon. \n \n In 2005, Casa Batll\u00f3 became an UNESCO World Heritage Site among the other [https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/320/ Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed], and is visited by people from around the world.  \n \n ==History== \n ===Initial construction (1877)=== \n [[File:Gaud%C3%AD_(1910).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Antoni Gaud\u00ed in 1910]] \n The building that is now Casa Batll\u00f3  was built in 1877, commissioned by Llu\u00eds Sala S\u00e1nchez. < ref > {{cite book |last= Bassegoda i Nonell |first= Joan |title= La Casa Butll\u00f3 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kJ5oMwEACAAJ |access-date= March 8, 2012|year=2001 |publisher= Publicaciones de la Real C\u00e1tedra Gaud\u00ed |location=Barcelona |page=4 |language=es}} < /ref >  It was a classical building without remarkable characteristics within the [[eclecticism]] traditional by the end of the 19th century. < ref > {{cite book |last= Bassegoda i Nonell |first= Joan |title= Los jardines de Gaud\u00ed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPM01pCm_QIC |year=2001 |publisher=Edicions UPC |isbn=9788483015384 |page=75 |language=es}} < /ref >  The building had a basement, a ground floor, four other floors and a garden in the back. < ref name= \" workart \" > {{Cite web|url=https://www.casabatllo.es/en/antoni-gaudi/works/|title=Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed|website=Casa Batll\u00f3}} < /ref > \n \n ===Batll\u00f3 family=== \n [[File:Batllo-godo-per Napoleon.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The Batll\u00f3 family]] \n The house was bought by Josep Batll\u00f3 in 1900. The design of the house made the home undesirable to buyers but the Batll\u00f3 family decided to buy the place due to its centralized location. It is located in the middle of [[Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia]], which in the early 20th century was known as a very prestigious and fashionable area. It was an area where the prestigious family could draw attention to themselves. < ref name= \" workart \" / > \n \n In 1906 Josep Batll\u00f3 still owned the home. The Batll\u00f3 family was very well known in Barcelona for its contribution to the textile industry in the city. Mr. Josep Batll\u00f3 i Casanovas was a textile industrialist who owned a few factories in the city. Mr. Batll\u00f3 married Am\u00e0lia God\u00f3 Belaunzar\u00e1n, from the family that founded the newspaper ''La Vanguardia''. Josep wanted an architect that would design a house that was like no other and stood out as being audacious and creative. Both Josep and his wife were open to anything and they decided not to limit Gaud\u00ed. Josep did not want his house to resemble any of the houses of the rest of the Batll\u00f3 family, such as Casa P\u00eda, built by the Josep Vilaseca. He chose the architect who had designed [[Park G\u00fcell]] because he wanted him to come up with a risky plan. The family lived on the Noble Floor of Casa Batll\u00f3 until the middle of the 1950s. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.casabatllo.es/en/antoni-gaudi/|title=Antoni Gaud\u00ed Biography|website=Casa Batll\u00f3}} < /ref > \n \n ===Renovation (1904-1906)=== \n [[File:Casa Batll\u00f3 (Antoni Gaudi) (atrium,close up), 43, Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, Eixample, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.jpg|thumb|240px|The atrium; Gaud\u00ed convinced Batll\u00f3 to let him expand the central well of the building to let in light, instead of rebuilding.]] \n In 1904 Josep Batll\u00f3 hired Gaud\u00ed to design his home; at first his plans were to tear down the building and construct a completely new house. Gaud\u00ed convinced Josep that a renovation was sufficient and was also able to submit the planning application the same year. The building was completed and refurbished in 1906. He completely changed the main apartment which became the residence for the Batll\u00f3 family. He expanded the central well in order to supply light to the whole building and also added new floors. In the same year the Barcelona City Council selected the house as a candidate for that year's best building award. The award was given to another architect that year despite Gaud\u00ed's design. \n \n ===Refurbishments=== \n Josep Batll\u00f3 died in 1934 and the house was kept in order by the wife until her death in 1940 . After the death of the two parents, the house was kept and managed by the children until 1954. In 1954 an insurance company named Seguros Iberia acquired Casa Batll\u00f3 and set up offices there. In 1970, the first refurbishment occurred mainly in several of the interior rooms of the house. In 1983, the exterior balconies were restored to their original colour and a year later the exterior fa\u00e7ade was illuminated in the ceremony of [[La Merc\u00e8]]. \n \n ===Multiple uses=== \n In 1993, the current owners of Casa Batll\u00f3 bought the home and continued refurbishments throughout the whole building. < ref > In 1999 the elevator was reformed to adapt it to modern standards preserving its original appearance. The project was by Joan Bassegoda Nonell and collaborators Bibiana Sciortino and Mario Andruet. < /ref >  Two years later, in 1995, Casa Batll\u00f3 began to hire out its facilities for different events. More than 2,500 square meters of rooms within the building were rented out for many different functions. Due to the building's location and the beauty of the facilities being rented, the rooms of Casa Batll\u00f3 were in very high demand and hosted many important events for the city. \n < ref > [https://www.tripindicator.com/casa-batllo-tours-tickets.html Guide to Casa Batllo Barcelona] < /ref > \n \n ==Design== \n [[File:Casa Batll\u00f3 fireplace seat.JPG|thumb|Casa Batll\u00f3 fireplace seat]] \n \n ===Overview=== \n The local name for the building is ''Casa dels ossos'' (House of Bones), as it has a [[viscera]]l, [[skeleton|skeletal]] organic quality. The building looks very remarkable  & mdash; like everything Gaud\u00ed designed, only identifiable as [[Modernisme]] or [[Art Nouveau]] in the broadest sense. The ground floor, in particular, is rather astonishing with tracery, irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work. \n \n It seems that the goal of the designer was to avoid straight lines completely. Much of the [[fa\u00e7ade]] is decorated with a [[mosaic]] made of broken ceramic tiles ([[trencad\u00eds]]) that starts in shades of golden orange moving into greenish blues. The roof is [[arch]]ed and was likened to the back of a [[European dragon|dragon]] or [[dinosaur]]. A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the lance of [[Saint George]] (patron saint of [[Catalonia]], Gaud\u00ed's home), which has been plunged into the back of the dragon. \n \n ===Loft=== \n [[File:Casa Batll\u00f3 Parabolic Arches.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The loft, originally a service area, has sixty [[catenary arches]]]] \n \n The loft is considered to be one of the most unusual spaces. It was formerly a service area for the tenants of the different apartments in the building which contained laundry rooms and storage areas. It is known for its simplicity of shapes and its Mediterranean influence through the use of white on the walls. It contains a series of sixty [[catenary arch]]es that creates a space which represents the ribcage of an animal.  Some people believe that the \u201cribcage\u201d design of the arches is a ribcage for the dragon's spine that is represented in the roof. \n \n ===Noble floor and museum=== \n [[File:Casa Batll\u00f3 (Antoni Gaudi) (interior), 43, Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, Eixample, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Interior of the Noble Floor, which currently houses a museum open to the public]] \n The noble floor is larger than seven-hundred square meters. It is the main floor of the building. The noble floor is accessed through a private entrance hall that utilizes skylights resembling tortoise shells and vaulted walls in curving shapes. On the noble floor, there is a spacious landing with direct views to the blue tiling of the building well. On the Passeig de Gracia side is Mr. Batll\u00f3's study, a dining room, and a secluded spot for courting couples, decorated with a mushroom-shaped fireplace. The elaborate and animal-like d\u00e9cor continues throughout the whole noble floor. \n \n In 2002, the house opened its doors to the public, and people were allowed to visit the noble floor. The building was opened to the public as part of the celebration of the International Year of Gaud\u00ed. Casa Batll\u00f3 met with very much unanticipated success, and visitors became eager to see the rest of the house. Two years later, in celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the beginning of work on Casa Batll\u00f3, the fifth floor was restored and the house extended its visit to the loft and the well. In 2005, Casa Batll\u00f3 became a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. < ref > [http://www.worldsiteguides.com/europe/spain/barcelona/casa-batllo/] < /ref > \n \n ===Roof=== \n [[File:Jfader batto roof.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Four chimney stacks on the roof, with the dragon's spine roof arch behind]] \n The roof terrace is one of the most popular features of the entire house due to its famous dragon back design. Gaud\u00ed represents an animal's spine by using tiles of different colors on one side. The roof is decorated with four chimney stacks, that are designed to prevent backdraughts. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.casabatllo.es/en/antoni-gaudi/casa-batllo/history/|title=The history of Casa Batll\u00f3|website=Casa Batll\u00f3}} < /ref > \n \n ===Exterior fa\u00e7ade=== \n [[File:CasaBatllo 0170.JPG|thumb|left|150px|The fa\u00e7ade has three distinct sections.]] \n The fa\u00e7ade has three distinct sections which are harmoniously integrated. The lower ground floor with the main floor and two first-floor galleries are contained in a structure of [[Montju\u00efc]] sandstone with undulating lines. The central part, which reaches the last floor, is a multicolored section with protruding balconies. The top of the building is a crown, like a huge gable, which is at the same level as the roof and helps to conceal the room where there used to be water tanks. This room is currently empty. The top displays a [[Molding (decorative)|trim]] with ceramic pieces that has attracted multiple interpretations. \n \n ;Roof tiles \n [[File:casa batllo roof.jpg|thumb|150px|Roof architecture and ceramic tiles, with tower and bulb in the background]] \n The roof's arched profile recalls the spine of a dragon with ceramic tiles for scales, and a small triangular window towards the right of the structure simulates the eye. Legend has it that it was once possible to see the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]] through this window, which was being built simultaneously. The view of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is now blocked from this vantage point by newer buildings. < ref > [[:ca:Casa Batll\u00f3#CITEREFCirici1956|Circi 1956, pp. 161\u2013165]]{{Better source needed|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}} < /ref >  The tiles were given a metallic sheen to simulate the varying scales of the monster, with the color grading from green on the right side, where the head begins, to deep blue and violet in the center, to red and pink on the left side of the building. \n \n ;Tower and bulb \n One of the highlights of the fa\u00e7ade is a tower topped with a cross of four arms oriented to the cardinal directions. It is a bulbous, root-like structure that evokes plant life. There is a second bulb-shaped structure similarly reminiscent of a thalamus flower, which is represented by a cross with arms that are actually buds announcing the next flowering. The tower is decorated with monograms of Jesus (JHS), Maria (M with the ducal crown) and Joseph (JHP), made of ceramic pieces that stand out golden on the green background that covers the fa\u00e7ade. These symbols show the deep religiosity of Gaud\u00ed, who was inspired by the contemporaneous construction of his basilica < ref > [[:ca:Casa Batll\u00f3#CITEREFBassegoda1981|Bassegoda 1981]]{{Better source needed|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}} < /ref >  to choose the theme of the holy family. \n \n The bulb was broken when it was delivered, perhaps during transportation. Although the manufacturer committed to re-do the broken parts, Gaud\u00ed liked the aesthetic of the broken masonry and asked that the pieces be stuck to the main structure with lime mortar and held in with a brass ring. < ref > [[:ca:Casa Batll\u00f3#CITEREFBassegoda i Nonell2001|Bassegoda Nonell and 2001, p. 10.]]{{Better source needed|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}} < /ref > \n \n ;Central section \n [[File:Casa Batllo.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The central part of the fa\u00e7ade evokes the surface of a lake with water lilies.]] \n The central part of the fa\u00e7ade evokes the surface of a lake with water lilies, reminiscent of [[Claude Monet|Monet]]'s ''[[Water Lilies (Monet series)|Nymph\u00e9as]]'', with gentle ripples and reflections caused by the glass and ceramic mosaic. < ref > [[:ca:Casa Batll\u00f3#CITEREFBassegoda2001|Bassegoda 2001, p. 75.]]{{Better source needed|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}} < /ref >  It is a great undulating surface covered with plaster fragments of colored glass discs combined with 330 rounds of polychrome pottery. The discs were designed by Gaud\u00ed and Jujol between tests during their stay in Majorca, while working on the restoration of the Cathedral of Palma. < ref > [[:ca:Casa Batll\u00f3#CITEREFBassegoda1971|Bassegoda 1971.]]{{Better source needed|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}} < /ref > \n \n ;Balcony \n Finally, above the central part of the fa\u00e7ade is a smaller balcony, also iron, with a different exterior aesthetic, closer to a local type of lily. Two iron arms were installed here to support a pulley to raise and lower furniture. < ref > [[:ca:Casa Batll\u00f3#CITEREFLahuerta2001|Lahuerta 2001, p. 31.]]{{Better source needed|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}} < /ref > \n \n ;Main floor \n The fa\u00e7ade of the main floor, made entirely in sandstone, and is supported by two columns. The design is complemented by joinery windows set with multicolored stained glass. < ref > [[:ca:Casa Batll\u00f3#CITEREFBassegoda i Nonell2001|Bassegoda Nonell and 2001, p. 4.]]{{Better source needed|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}} < /ref >  In front of the large windows, as if they were pillars that support the complex stone structure, there are six fine columns that seem to simulate the bones of a limb, with an apparent central articulation; in fact, this is a floral decoration. The rounded shapes of the gaps and the lip-like edges carved into the stone surrounding them create a semblance of a fully open mouth, for which the Casa Batll\u00f3 has been nicknamed the  \" house of yawns \" . The structure repeats on the first floor and in the design of two windows at the ends forming galleries, but on the large central window there are two balconies as described above. < ref > [[:ca:Casa Batll\u00f3#CITEREFBassegoda i Nonell2001|Bassegoda Nonell and 2001, p. 12.]]{{Better source needed|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}} < /ref > \n \n ==Gallery== \n < gallery > \n File: CasaBatll\u00f3 NobleFloor saloon stainedglass.jpg|Stained glass noblefloor of Casa Batll\u00f3 \n File: CasaBatll\u00f3 NobleFloor saloon side.jpg|Noblefloor of Casa Batll\u00f3 \n File: CasaBatllo rooftop chimneys dragon.jpg|Chimneys of Casa Batll\u00f3 \n File: CasaBatllo rooftop chimneys.jpg|Rooftop of Casa Batll\u00f3 \n File: CasaBatllo inner courtyard bottom.jpg|Inner lightwell of Casa Batll\u00f3 \n File: CasaBatllo inner courtyard.jpg|Blue lightwell of Casa Batll\u00f3 \n File: CasaBatllo attic arcs.jpg|Catenary arcs of Casa Batll\u00f3 \n File: CasaBatllo back dragon roof.jpg|Dragon roof of Casa Batll\u00f3 \n File: CasaBatllo dragon stairs.jpg|Dragon stairs of Casa Batll\u00f3 \n File: CasaBatllo NobleFloor saloon.jpg|Saloon noble floor of Casa Batll\u00f3 \n File:Facade of Casa Batll\u00f3 - 2013.07 - panoramio.jpg|Fa\u00e7ade of Casa Batll\u00f3 \n Image: Close up Casa Batlo.JPG|Fa\u00e7ade close-up \n Image: CasaBatllo 0096.JPG|Interior of the noblefloor \n Image: Casa batllo chimney.jpg|Close-up of a chimney \n Image: staircase casa batllo.jpg|Unique design of the staircase and ceiling \n Image: Casa Batll\u00f3 Fireplace.jpg|Casa Batll\u00f3 fireplace \n Image: Casa Batll\u00f3 Light Well.jpg|Casa Batll\u00f3 central light well \n Casa Batll\u00f3 - Barcelona.jpg |Casa Batll\u00f3 - Night View \n File: Casa Batll\u00f3 (Antoni Gaudi) (atrium), 43, Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, Eixample, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.jpg|Atrium of Casa Batll\u00f3 \n File: Casa Batll\u00f3 (Antoni Gaudi) (interior, ceiling close up), 43, Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, Eixample, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.jpg|Ceiling close-up \n File: Casa Batll\u00f3 (Antoni Gaudi) (interior, stained-glass window close up), 43, Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, Eixample, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.jpg|Stained-glass window close-up \n File: Casa Batll\u00f3 chair.JPG|Chair in oak, designed 1906 \n File:Gaudi-prie-dieu.jpg|Prie Dieu, or prayer desk, designed 1906 \n File:Casa Batll\u00f3 - Night View Long Exposure.jpg|thumb|Casa Batll\u00f3 - Night View  Long Exposure \n File:Casa Batll\u00f3 - Night View with Flowers.jpg|thumb|Casa Batll\u00f3 - Night View with Flowers \n File:Casa Batll\u00f3 - Night View.jpg|thumb|Casa Batll\u00f3 - Night View \n File:Casa Batll\u00f3 - Night View Corner.jpg|thumb|Casa Batll\u00f3 - Night View Corner \n < /gallery > \n \n ==See also== \n * [[List of Modernisme buildings in Barcelona]] \n * [[Confidant from the Batll\u00f3 House]] \n \n ==References== \n {{more citations needed|date=May 2014}} \n {{Reflist}} \n \n ==External links== \n {{commons}} \n ;Official website \n * [http://www.casabatllo.es/en Casa Batll\u00f3] \n * [http://www.casabatllostore.com Casa Batll\u00f3 Store] \n * [http://www.casabatllo.es/en/virtual-tour/ Official Virtual Tour] \n \n ;Unofficial websites \n * [http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Casa_Batllo.html Casa Batll\u00f3 on GreatBuildings.com] \n * [http://www.barcelona-tourist-guide.com/albums-en/gaudi-casa-batllo/index.html Casa Batll\u00f3 pictures] \n * [https://web.archive.org/web/20050901163040/http://www.op.net/~jmeltzer/Gaudi/batllo.html Casa Batll\u00f3 description] \n * [http://www.gaudidesigner.com/uk/casa-batllo.html Casa Batllo at Gaudidesigner.com] \n * [http://modernistespuntcom.blogspot.com/2010/04/casa-batllo.html Casa Batllo at Tot Passejant] '''(Spanish)''' \n \n {{Illa de la Disc\u00f2rdia}} \n \n {{Antoni Gaud\u00ed}} \n {{Barcelona landmarks}} \n {{Authority control}} \n \n {{DEFAULTSORT:Casa Batllo}} \n [[Category:Visionary environments]] \n [[Category:Modernisme architecture in Barcelona]] \n [[Category:Antoni Gaud\u00ed buildings]] \n [[Category:Houses completed in 1877]] \n [[Category:World Heritage Sites in Catalonia]] \n [[Category:Tourist attractions in Barcelona]] \n [[Category:Eixample]] \n [[Category:Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia]] \n [[Category:Art Nouveau houses]] \n [[Category:Azulejos in buildings in Catalonia]] \n [[Category:1877 establishments in Spain]] \n [[Category:Houses in Catalonia]]"
