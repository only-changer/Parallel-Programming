According to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', no one was aware that Ajax had raped Cassandra until [[Calchas]], the Greek seer, warned the Greeks that Athena was furious at the treatment of her priestess and she would destroy the Greek ships if they didn't kill him immediately. Despite this, Ajax managed to hide at the altar of a deity where the Greeks, fearing divine retribution should they kill him and destroy the altar, allowed him to live. When the Greeks left without killing Ajax, despite their sacrifices, Athena became so angry that she persuaded [[Zeus]] to send a storm that sank many of their ships. \n \n [[File:Poseidon and Ajax.png|thumb|Poseidon killing Ajax the Lesser, drawing by [[Bonaventura Genelli]]]] \n \n As he was [[Returns from Troy|returning from Troy]], Athena hit his ship with a thunderbolt and the vessel was wrecked on the Whirling Rocks ({{lang|grc|\u0393\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9}}). But he escaped with some of his men, managing to cling onto a rock through the assistance of [[Poseidon]]. He would have been saved in spite of Athena, but he then audaciously declared that he would escape the dangers of the sea in defiance of the immortals. Offended by this presumption, Poseidon split the rock with his [[trident]] and Ajax was swallowed up by the sea. < ref > Homer, ''[[Odyssey]]'' iv. 499,  & c. < /ref > {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} [[Thetis]] buried him when the corpse washed up on [[Mykonos]]. < ref > Apollodore, R.

In these versions, when Ajax came to the Capharean Rocks on the coast of [[Euboea]], his ship was wrecked in a fierce storm, he himself was lifted up in a whirlwind and impaled with a flash of rapid fire from Athena in his chest, and his body thrust upon sharp rocks, which afterwards were called the rocks of Ajax. < ref name= \" ReferenceA \"  / > < ref > comp.
