He was one of the most prominent political figures of the early [[Renaissance]]. \n \n ==Early life== \n Born at [[Medina del Campo]], he was the son of [[Ferdinand I of Aragon|Ferdinand of Trast\u00e1mara]] and [[Eleanor of Alburquerque]]. Ferdinand was the brother of King [[Henry III of Castile]], and Alfonso was betrothed to his uncle King Henry's daughter [[Maria of Castile|Maria]] in 1408. In 1412, Ferdinand was [[compromise of Caspe|selected]] to succeed to the territories of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. Alfonso and Maria's marriage was celebrated in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] on 12 June 1415. \n \n King Ferdinand died on 2 April 1416, and Alfonso succeeded him as [[king of Aragon]], [[king of Valencia|Valencia]], and [[king of Majorca|Majorca]] and [[count of Barcelona]]. He also claimed the island of [[Sardinia]], though it was then in the possession of [[Genoa]]. Alfonso was also in possession of much of [[Corsica]] by the 1420s. < ref > Gallinari, L. (2019).

His mistress [[Lucrezia d'Alagno]] served as a ''de facto'' queen at the Neapolitan court as well as an inspiring [[muse]]. With another mistress, [[Giraldona Carlino]], Alfonso had three children: [[Ferdinand I of Naples|Ferdinand]] (1423\u20131494), Maria (who married [[Leonello d'Este]]), and Eleanor (who married Mariano Marzano).{{sfn|Widmayer|2006|p=231}} \n \n Alfonso was the object of diplomatic contacts from the [[Empire of Ethiopia]]. In 1428, he received a letter from [[Yeshaq I of Ethiopia]], borne by two dignitaries, which proposed an alliance against the [[Muslim]]s and would be sealed by a dual marriage that would require Alfonso's brother [[Peter of Aragon, Count of Alburquerque|Peter]] to bring a group of artisans to Ethiopia where he would marry Yeshaq's daughter. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=GARRETSON|first=PETER P.|date=1993|title=A NOTE ON RELATIONS BETWEEN ETHIOPIA AND THE KINGDOM OF ARAGON IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41299786|journal=Rassegna di Studi Etiopici|volume=37|pages=37\u201344|issn=0390-0096}} < /ref >  In return, Alfonso sent a party of 13 craftsmen, all of whom perished on the way to Ethiopia. < ref > Girma Beshah and Merid Wolde Aregay, ''The Question of the Union of the Churches in Luso-Ethiopian Relations (1500\u20131632)'' (Lisbon: Junta de Investiga\u00e7\u00f5es do Ultramar and Centro de Estudos Hist\u00f3ricos Ultramarinos, 1964), pp.13\u20134. < /ref >  He later sent a letter to Yeshaq's successor [[Zara Yaqob]] in 1450, in which he wrote that he would be happy to send artisans to Ethiopia if their safe arrival could be guaranteed, but it probably never reached Zara Yaqob. < ref > Girma Beshah and Merid Wolde Aregay, ''The Question of the Union of the Churches'', pp.14. < /ref > < ref > [[O.

With Pope [[Martin V]] supporting Sforza, Alfonso switched his religious allegiance to the Aragonese [[antipope Benedict XIII]]. When Sforza abandoned Louis' cause, Alfonso seemed to have all his problems solved; however, his relationship with Joanna suddenly worsened, and in May 1423 he had her lover, [[Gianni Caracciolo]], a powerful figure in the Neapolitan court, arrested.{{sfn|Armstrong|1964|p=164}} \n \n After an attempt to arrest the queen herself had failed, Joan called on Sforza who defeated the Aragonese militias near [[Castel Capuano]] in Naples. Alfonso fled to [[Castel Nuovo]], but the help of a fleet of 22 galleys led by [[Giovanni da Cardona]] improved his situation.{{sfn|Armstrong|1964|p=165}} Sforza and Joanna ransomed Caracciolo and retreated to the fortress of [[Aversa]].{{sfn|Armstrong|1964|p=165}} Here she repudiated her earlier adoption of Alfonso and, with the backing of Martin V, named Louis III as her heir instead.{{sfn|Grierson|Travaini|1998|p=245}} \n \n The duke of Milan, [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], joined the anti-Aragonese coalition. Alfonso requested support from Braccio da Montone, who was besieging Joanna's troops in [[L'Aquila]], but had to set sail for Spain, where a war had broken out between his brothers and the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. On his way towards Barcelona, Alfonso sacked [[Marseille]], a possession of Louis III.{{sfn|Armstrong|1964|p=165}} \n \n In late 1423 the Genoese fleet of Filippo Maria Visconti moved in the southern [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], rapidly conquering [[Gaeta]], [[Procida]], [[Castellammare di Stabia|Castellammare]] and [[Sorrento]]. Naples, which was held by Alfonso's brother, Pedro de Aragon,{{sfn|Armstrong|1964|p=165}} was besieged in 1424 by the Genoese ships and Joanna's troops, now led by [[Francesco Sforza]], the son of Muzio Sforza (who had met his death at L'Aquila). The city fell in April 1424. Pedro, after a short resistance in Castel Nuovo, fled to [[Sicily]] in August. Joanna II and Louis III again took possession of the realm, although the true power was in the hands of [[Gianni Caracciolo]].{{sfn|Armstrong|1964|p=165}} \n \n An opportunity for Alfonso to reconquer Naples occurred in 1432, when Caracciolo was killed in a conspiracy.{{sfn|Armstrong|1964|p=165}} Alfonso tried to regain the favour of the queen, but failed, and had to wait for the death of both Louis (at Cosenza in 1434) and Joanna herself (February 1435). In her will, she bequeathed her realm to [[Ren\u00e9 of Anjou]], Louis III's younger brother. This solution was opposed by the new pope, [[Eugene IV]], who was the feudal overlord of the Kingdom of Naples. The Neapolitans having called in the French, Alfonso decided to intervene and, with the support of several barons of the kingdom, captured [[Capua]] and besieged the important sea fortress of Gaeta. His fleet of 25 galleys was met by the Genoese ships sent by Visconti, led by [[Biagio Assereto]]. In the [[Battle of Ponza (1435)|battle of Ponza]] that ensued, Alfonso was defeated and taken prisoner.{{sfn|Bisson|1991|p=144}} \n \n In Milan, Alfonso impressed his captor with his cultured demeanor and persuaded him to let him go by making it plain that it was not in Milan's interest to prevent the victory of the Aragonese party in Naples.{{sfn|Bisson|1991|p=144}} Helped by a Sicilian fleet, Alfonso recaptured Capua and set his base in Gaeta in February 1436. Meanwhile, papal troops had invaded the Neapolitan kingdom, but Alfonso bribed their commander, Cardinal [[Giovanni Vitelleschi]], and their successes waned. < ref > {{Cite book|last=Gregorovius|first=Ferdinand|title=History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages|year=1859}} < /ref > \n \n In the meantime, Ren\u00e9 had managed to reach Naples on 19 May 1438. Alfonso tried to besiege the city in the following September, but failed.{{sfn|Bisson|1991|p=144}} His brother Pedro was killed during the battle. Castel Nuovo, where an Aragonese garrison resisted, fell to the Angevine mercenaries in August 1439. After the death of his condottiero [[Jacopo Caldora]], however, Ren\u00e9's fortune started to decline: Alfonso could easily capture [[Aversa]], [[Salerno]], [[Benevento]], [[Manfredonia]] and [[Bitonto]]. Ren\u00e9, whose possession included now only part of the [[Abruzzi]] and Naples, obtained 10,000 men from the pope, but the cardinal leading them signed a truce with Alfonso. Giovanni Sforza came with a reduced corps, as troops sent by Eugene IV had halted his father Francesco in the [[Marche]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} \n \n Alfonso, provided with the most impressive artillery of the times, again besieged Naples. The siege began on 10 November 1441, ending on 2 June the following year.  After the return of Ren\u00e9 to Provence, Alfonso easily reduced the remaining resistance and made his triumphal entrance in Naples on 26 February 1443, as the monarch of a pacified kingdom.{{sfn|Bisson|1991|p=144}} \n \n ==Art and administration== \n Like many Renaissance rulers, Alfonso V was a patron of the arts. He founded the Academy of [[Naples]] under [[Giovanni Pontano]], and for his entrance into the city in 1443 had a magnificent triumphal arch added to the main gate of [[Castel Nuovo]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Naples-Italy|title=Naples {{!}} History  &  Points of Interest|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}} < /ref >  Alfonso V supplied the theme of Renaissance sculptures over the west entrance. \n [[File:NapoliMaschioAngioinoIngresso.jpg|thumb|left|The triumphal arch entrance of Castel Nuovo.]] \n \n Alfonso was particularly attracted to [[classical literature]]. He reportedly brought copies of the works of [[Livy]] and [[Julius Caesar]] on his campaigns; the poet [[Antonio Beccadelli (poet)|Antonio Beccadelli]] even claimed that Alfonso was cured of a disease by the reading of a few pages from [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]]' history of [[Alexander the Great]]. Although this reputed erudition attracted scholars to his court, Alfonso apparently enjoyed pitting them against each other in spectacles of bawdy Latin rhetoric. < ref > {{cite EB1911|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso V. of Aragon|volume=1|page=736}} < /ref > \n \n After his conquest of Naples in 1442, Alfonso ruled primarily through his mercenaries and political lackeys. In his Italian kingdom, he maintained the former political and administrative institutions. His holdings in Spain were governed by his brother John.{{sfn|Bisson|1991|p=147}} \n \n A unified General Chancellorship for the whole Aragonese realm was set up in Naples, although the main functionaries were of Aragonese nationality. Apart from financial, administrative and artistic improvements, his other accomplishments in the Sicilian kingdom include the restoration of the aqueducts, the drainage of marshy areas, and the paving of streets. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/arts-construction-medicine-science-and-technology-magazines/alfonso-v-aragon-magnanimous-1396-1458|title=Alfonso V of Aragon (the Magnanimous) (1396\u20131458) - Dictionary definition of Alfonso V of Aragon (the Magnanimous) (1396\u20131458) {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}} < /ref > \n \n == Later life== \n \n Alfonso was also a powerful and faithful supporter of [[Skanderbeg]], whom he decided to take under his protection as a vassal in 1451, shortly after the latter had scored his second victory against [[Murad II]]. In addition to financial assistance, he supplied the [[Albania]]n leader with troops, military equipment, and sanctuary for himself and his family if such a need should arise.  This was because in 1448, while Skanderbeg was victoriously fighting off the Turkish invasions, three military columns, commanded by [[Demetrio Reres]] along with his sons Giorgio and Basilio, had been dispatched to help Alfonso V defeat the barons of Naples who had rebelled against him. < ref > {{Cite web|title=The Case of the Ruthless Ruler With a Deadly Disease|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/573905|access-date=2021-03-30|website=Medscape}} < /ref > \n \n Alfonso, by formally submitting his reign to the Papacy, obtained the consent of [[Pope Eugene IV]] that the Kingdom of Naples would go to his illegitimate son, Ferdinand. He died in [[Castel dell'Ovo]] in 1458, while he was planning the conquest of [[Genoa]]. At the time, Alfonso was at odds with [[Pope Callixtus III]], who died shortly afterwards.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} Alfonso's Iberian possessions had been ruled for him by his brother, who succeeded him as [[John II of Aragon]].{{sfn|Bisson|1991|p=147}}  Sicily and [[Sardinia]] were also inherited by John II. \n \n ==Marriage and issue== \n \n Alfonso had been betrothed to [[Maria of Castile]] (1401\u20131458; sister of [[John II of Castile]]) in [[Valladolid]] in 1408; the marriage was celebrated in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] on 12 June 1415. They failed to produce children.  Alfonso had been in love with a woman of noble family named [[Lucrezia d'Alagno]], who served as a ''de facto'' queen at the Neapolitan court as well as an inspiring [[muse]]. \n \n Genealogical records in the [[Occitan language|Old Occitan]] [[Chronique romane|Chronicle of Montpellier]] in ''Le petit Thalamus de Montpellier'' indicate that Alphonso's relationship with his mistress, [[Giraldona Carlino]], produced three children:{{sfn|Widmayer|2006|p=231}} \n \n * His successor in Naples, King [[Ferdinand I of Naples]], (born 1423; reigned 1458\u20131494). \n * Maria d'Aragon (died 1449, aged around 15 or 16). She had married in 1444 [[Leonello d'Este, margrave of Ferrara|Leonello d'Este]], deceased 1450. \n * [[Leonora d'Aragona]], who married c. 1443, Mariano Marzano, Duke of Squillace, Prince of Rossano.
