The [[Tokugawa bakufu]] (feudal government) granted the [[Matsumae clan]] exclusive rights to trade with the Ainu in the northern part of the island. Later, the Matsumae began to lease out trading rights to Japanese merchants, and contact between Japanese and Ainu became more extensive.

The most important was [[Shakushain's Revolt]] (1669\u20131672), an Ainu rebellion against Japanese authority. Another large-scale revolt by Ainu against Japanese rule was the [[Menashi-Kunashir Battle]] in 1789. \n \n From 1799 to 1806, the shogunate took direct control of southern Hokkaid\u014d. Ainu men were deported to merchant subcontractors for five and ten-year terms of service, and were enticed with rewards of food and clothing if they agreed to drop their native language and culture and become Japanese. Ainu women were separated from their husbands and forcibly married to Japanese merchants and fishermen, who were told that a taboo forbade them from bringing their wives to Hokkaid\u014d. Women were often tortured if they resisted rape by their new Japanese husbands, and frequently ran away into the mountains. These policies of family separation and forcible assimilation, combined with the impact of smallpox, caused the Ainu population to drop significantly in the early 19th century. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Lewallen |title=The fabric of indigeneity : Ainu identity, gender, and settler colonialism in Japan |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |location=Albuquerque |isbn=978-0-8263-5736-6 |pages=131\u2013142|year=2016 }} < /ref > \n \n === Meiji Restoration and later === \n In the 18th century, there were 80,000 Ainu. < ref > {{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity |first=Dinah |last=Shelton |volume=2 |publisher=Macmillan Reference |year=2005}} < /ref >  In 1868, there were about 15,000 Ainu in Hokkaid\u014d, 2000 in Sakhalin and around 100 in the Kuril islands. < ref > {{cite book |first=David |last=Howell |chapter=The Meiji State and the Logic of Ainu 'Protection' |title=New Directions in the Study of Meiji Japan |editor-first=Helen |editor-last=Hardacre |location=Leiden |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |year=1997 |page=614 |isbn=978-9-00410-735-9}} < /ref > \n \n The beginning of the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868 proved a turning point for Ainu culture.
