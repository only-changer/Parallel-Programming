  "{{Short description|chemical element with atomic number 89}} \n {{Distinguish|Actin}} \n {{Use dmy dates|date=March 2014}} \n {{Infobox actinium}} \n '''Actinium''' is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] & nbsp;'''Ac''' and [[atomic number]] & nbsp;89. It was first isolated by [[Friedrich Oskar Giesel]] in 1902, who gave it the name ''emanium''; the element got its name by being wrongly identified with a substance [[Andr\u00e9-Louis Debierne]] found and called actinium. Actinium gave the name to the [[actinide]] series, a group of 15 similar elements between actinium and [[lawrencium]] in the [[periodic table]]. Together with [[polonium]], [[radium]], and [[radon]], actinium was one of the first [[Primordial element|non-primordial radioactive element]]s to be isolated. \n \n A soft, silvery-white [[radioactive]] metal, actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. As with most [[lanthanide]]s and many [[actinide]]s, actinium assumes [[oxidation state]] +3 in nearly all its chemical compounds. Actinium is found only in traces in [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] ores as the [[isotope]]  < sup > 227 < /sup > Ac, which decays with a [[half-life]] of 21.772 years, predominantly emitting [[beta particle|beta]] and sometimes [[alpha particle]]s, and  < sup > 228 < /sup > Ac, which is beta active with a half-life of 6.15 hours. One [[tonne]] of natural [[uranium]] in ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium-227, and one tonne of [[thorium]] contains about 5 nanograms of actinium-228. The close similarity of physical and chemical properties of actinium and [[lanthanum]] makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical. Instead, the element is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of  < sup > 226 < /sup > {{radium}} in a [[nuclear reactor]]. Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium has no significant industrial use. Its current applications include a neutron source and an agent for [[radiation therapy]]. \n \n ==History== \n [[Andr\u00e9-Louis Debierne]], a French chemist, announced the discovery of a new element in 1899. He separated it from [[uraninite|pitchblende]] residues left by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] after they had extracted [[radium]]. In 1899, Debierne described the substance as similar to [[titanium]] < ref > {{cite journal |title = Sur un nouvelle mati\u00e8re radio-active |first = Andr\u00e9-Louis |last = Debierne |journal = Comptes Rendus |volume = 129 |pages = 593\u2013595 |date = 1899 |url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3085b/f593.table |language=fr}} < /ref >  and (in 1900) as similar to [[thorium]]. < ref > {{cite journal |title = Sur un nouvelle mati\u00e8re radio-actif \u2013 l'actinium |first = Andr\u00e9-Louis |last = Debierne |journal = Comptes Rendus |volume = 130 |pages = 906\u2013908 |date = 1900\u20131901 |url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3086n/f906.table |language=fr}} < /ref >  [[Friedrich Oskar Giesel]] found in 1902 < ref > {{cite journal |title = Ueber Radium und radioactive Stoffe |first = Friedrich Oskar |last = Giesel |journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft |volume = 35 |issue = 3 |pages = 3608\u20133611 |date = 1902 |doi = 10.1002/cber.190203503187 |language=de|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1426058 }} < /ref >  a substance similar to [[lanthanum]] and called it  \" emanium \"  in 1904. < ref > {{cite journal |title = Ueber den Emanationsk\u00f6rper (Emanium) |first = Friedrich Oskar |last = Giesel |journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft |volume = 37 |issue = 2 |pages = 1696\u20131699 |date = 1904 |doi = 10.1002/cber.19040370280 |language=de|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1426108 }} < /ref >  After a comparison of the substances' half-lives determined by Debierne, < ref > {{cite journal |title = Sur l'actinium |first = Andr\u00e9-Louis |last = Debierne |journal = Comptes Rendus |volume = 139 |pages = 538\u2013540 |date = 1904 |language=fr}} < /ref >  [[Harriet Brooks]] in 1904, and [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Otto Sackur]] in 1905, Debierne's chosen name for the new element was retained because it had seniority, despite the contradicting chemical properties he claimed for the element at different times. < ref > {{cite journal |title = Ueber Emanium |first = Friedrich Oskar |last = Giesel |journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft |volume = 37 |issue = 2 |pages = 1696\u20131699 |date = 1904 |doi = 10.1002/cber.19040370280 |language=de|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1426108 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |title = Ueber Emanium |first = Friedrich Oskar |last = Giesel |journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft |volume = 38 |issue = 1 |pages = 775\u2013778 |date = 1905 |doi = 10.1002/cber.190503801130 |url = https://zenodo.org/record/1426124 |language=de}} < /ref > \n \n Articles published in the 1970s < ref name=discovery > {{cite journal |title = The Discovery of Actinium |first = Harold W. |last = Kirby |journal = Isis |volume = 62 |issue = 3 |pages = 290\u2013308 \n |date = 1971 |jstor=229943 |doi =10.1086/350760}} < /ref >  and later < ref name= \" Adloff \" > {{cite journal |title = The centenary of a controversial discovery: actinium |first = J.

Furthermore, the now-known chemistry of actinium precludes its presence as anything other than a minor constituent of Debierne's 1899 and 1900 results; in fact, the chemical properties he reported make it likely that he had, instead, accidentally identified [[protactinium]], which would not be discovered for another fourteen years, only to have it disappear due to its hydrolysis and adsorption onto his [[laboratory equipment]].

The associated processes cannot be studied with the required accuracy by direct measurements of current velocities (of the order 50 meters per year). However, evaluation of the concentration depth-profiles for different isotopes allows estimating the mixing rates. The physics behind this method is as follows: oceanic waters contain homogeneously dispersed  < sup > 235 < /sup > U. Its decay product,  < sup > 231 < /sup > Pa, gradually precipitates to the bottom, so that its concentration first increases with depth and then stays nearly constant.  < sup > 231 < /sup > Pa decays to  < sup > 227 < /sup > Ac; however, the concentration of the latter isotope does not follow the  < sup > 231 < /sup > Pa depth profile, but instead increases toward the sea bottom. This occurs because of the mixing processes which raise some additional  < sup > 227 < /sup > Ac from the sea bottom. Thus analysis of both  < sup > 231 < /sup > Pa and  < sup > 227 < /sup > Ac depth profiles allows researchers to model the mixing behavior. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Nozaki |first1=Yoshiyuki |title=Excess  < sup > 227 < /sup > Ac in deep ocean water |journal=Nature |volume=310 |pages=486\u2013488 |date=1984 |doi=10.1038/310486a0 | issue=5977 | bibcode = 1984Natur.310..486N|s2cid=4344946 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Geibert |first1=W. |last2=Rutgers Van Der Loeff |first2=M.
