Commonly referred to as the '''aster''', '''daisy''', '''composite''', or '''sunflower family''', Compositae were first described in 1740. The number of species in Asteraceae is rivaled only by the [[Orchidaceae]], and which is the larger family is unclear as the quantity of [[Extant taxon|extant]] species in each family is unknown.  \n \n Most species of Asteraceae are [[Annual plant|annual]], [[Biennial plant|biennial]], or [[Perennial plant|perennial]] herbaceous plants, but there are also shrubs, vines, and trees. The family has a widespread distribution, from subpolar to tropical regions in a wide variety of habitats. Most occur in hot desert and cold or hot semi-desert climates, and they are found on every continent but Antarctica. The primary common characteristic is the existence of sometimes hundreds of tiny individual [[florets]] which are held together by protective [[involucre]]s in [[flower head]]s, or more technically, ''capitula''. \n \n The oldest known fossils are pollen grains from the [[Late Cretaceous]] ([[Campanian]] to [[Maastrichtian]]) of Antarctica, dated to c. 76\u201366 [[myr|million years (myr)]]. It is estimated that the [[crown group]] of Asteraceae evolved at least 85.9 myr (Late Cretaceous, [[Santonian]]) with a stem node age of 88\u201389 myr (Late Cretaceous, [[Coniacian]]). \n \n Asteraceae is an economically important family, providing food staples, garden plants, and herbal medicines. Species outside of their native ranges can be considered [[Weed|weedy]] or [[Invasive species|invasive]]. \n \n {{anchor|Characteristics}}  < !-- Section was renamed; anchor for backwards compatibility. -- > \n \n ==Description== \n Members of the Asteraceae are mostly [[herbaceous plants]], but some shrubs, vines, and trees (such as ''[[Lachanodes arborea]]'') do exist. Asteraceae species are generally easy to distinguish from other plants because of their unique [[inflorescence]] and other shared characteristics. < ref name=Judd/ > {{clarify|date=February 2021 |post-text=What other shared characteristics? }} However, determining genera and species of some groups such as ''[[Hieracium#Species|Hieracium]]'' is notoriously difficult (see  \" [[damned yellow composite]] \"  for example).{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} \n \n ===Roots=== \n Members of the family Asteraceae generally produce [[taproot]]s, but sometimes they possess fibrous root systems. Some species have underground stems in the form of [[caudex|caudices]] or [[rhizome]]s. These can be fleshy or woody depending on the species. < ref name=BarkleyEtAl/ > \n \n ===Stems=== \n Stems are herbaceous, aerial, branched, and cylindrical with glandular hairs, generally erect, but can be prostrate to ascending. The stems can contain secretory canals with [[resin]], < ref name=BarkleyEtAl/ >  or [[latex]] which is particularly common among the [[Cichorioideae]]. < ref name=KGL/ > \n \n ===Leaves=== \n Leaves can be [[Alternate leaf|alternate]], [[Opposite leaf|opposite]], or [[Whorl (botany)|whorled]]. They may be [[Simple leaf|simple]], but are often deeply [[Lobed leaf|lobed]] or otherwise incised, often [[Conduplicate leaf|conduplicate]] or [[Revolute leaf|revolute]]. The margins also can be [[Entire leaf|entire]] or [[Dentate leaf|toothed]]. Resin < ref name=BarkleyEtAl/ >  or latex < ref name=KGL/ >  also can be present in the leaves.  \n \n {{anchor|Flowers|Floral heads|Floral structures}}  < !-- section was renamed; anchors for backwards compatibility -- > \n ===Inflorescences=== \n Nearly all Asteraceae bear their flowers in dense flower heads called ''capitula''. They are surrounded by [[bract#Involucral bracts|involucral bracts]], and when viewed from a distance, each capitulum may appear to be a single flower. Enlarged outer (peripheral) flowers in the capitulum may resemble petals, and the involucral bracts may look like a calyx. \n \n ==== Floral heads ==== \n {{One source section|date=February 2021}} \n {{multiple image \n | align     = right \n | direction = horizontal \n | image1    = Bidens flwr.jpg \n | width1    = {{#expr: trunc (250 * 600 / 746)}} \n | caption1  = A typical Asteraceae flower head showing the individual flowers (''[[Bidens torta]]'') \n | image2    = Chrysanthemum February 2008-1.jpg \n | width2    = {{#expr: trunc (250 * 599 / 601)}} \n | caption2  = A flower head showing the individual flowers opening from the outside (''[[Garden marguerite|Argyranthemum]]'' 'Bridesmaid') \n }} \n In plants of the family Asteraceae, what appears to be a single flower is actually a cluster of much smaller flowers. The overall appearance of the cluster, as a single flower, functions in attracting [[pollinators]] in the same way as the structure of an individual flower in some other plant families. The older family name, Compositae, comes from the fact that what appears to be a single flower is actually a ''composite'' of smaller flowers. < ref name=CDF/ > \n \n The  \" petals \"  or  \" sunrays \"  in a sunflower head are actually individual strap-shaped < ref name=MDW/ >  flowers called '''ray flowers''', and the  \" sun disk \"  is made of smaller circular shaped individual flowers called '''disc flowers'''. The word  \" aster \"  means  \" star \"  in Greek, referring to the appearance of some family members, as a  \" star \"  surrounded by  \" rays \" . The cluster of flowers that may appear to be a single flower, is called a ''head''. The entire head may move tracking the sun, like a  \" smart \"  solar panel, which maximizes reflectivity of the whole unit and can thereby attract more pollinators. < ref name=CDF/ > \n \n On the outside the flower heads are small bracts that look like scales. These are called ''[[phyllary|phyllaries]]'', and together they form the [[involucre]] that protects the individual flowers in the head before they open.{{r|CDF|p=29}} The individual heads have the smaller individual flowers arranged on a round or dome-like structure called the ''receptacle''. The flowers mature first at the outside, moving toward the center, with the youngest in the middle.{{r|CDF}} \n \n The individual flowers in a head have 5 fused petals (rarely 4), but instead of sepals, have threadlike, hairy, or bristly structures called ''[[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]]'', which surround the fruit and can stick to animal fur or be lifted by wind, aiding in seed dispersal. The whitish fluffy head of a dandelion, commonly blown on by children, is made of the pappus, with tiny seeds attached at the ends, whereby the pappus provides a parachute like structure to help the seed be carried away in the wind. < ref name=CDF/ > \n [[File:Leucanthemum diagram.svg|thumb|653x653px|Schemes and floral diagrams of the different flower types (''[[Leucanthemum vulgare]]'' agg.): a \u2013 disc flower; b \u2013 ray flower. 1 \u2013 style with stigmas; 2 \u2013 anthers; 3 \u2013 corolla (petals), in the ray flower three petals are joined to form a strap (in other species, 5 petals can form a ligule); 4 \u2013 reduced calyx; 4\u2019 \u2013 in many other species (like ''Carduus acanthoides'' shown in the circle), it forms a pappus; 5 \u2013 inferior ovary fused of two carpels containing one abaxial ovule (basal placentation).]] \n \n A ''ray flower'' is a 3-tipped (3-lobed), strap-shaped, individual flower in the head of some members of the family Asteraceae. < ref name=CDF/ > < ref name=MDW/ >  Sometimes a ray flower is 2-tipped (2-lobed). The [[petal|corolla]] of the ray flower may have 2 tiny teeth opposite the 3-lobed strap, or tongue, indicating evolution by fusion from an originally 5-part corolla. Sometimes, the 3:2 arrangement is reversed, with 2 tips on the tongue, and 0 or 3 tiny teeth opposite the tongue. A ''ligulate flower'' is a 5-tipped, strap-shaped, individual flower in the heads of other members. < ref name=CDF/ >  A ''ligule'' is the strap-shaped tongue of the [[petal|corolla]] of either a ray flower or of a ligulate flower. < ref name=MDW/ >  A ''disk flower'' (or ''disc flower'') is a radially symmetric (i.e., with identical shaped petals arranged in circle around the center) individual flower in the head, which is ringed by ray flowers when both are present. < ref name=CDF/ > < ref name=MDW/ >  Sometimes ray flowers may be slightly off from radial symmetry, or weakly bilaterally symmetric, as in the case of desert pincushions ''[[Chaenactis fremontii]]''. < ref name=CDF/ > \n \n A ''radiate head'' has disc flowers surrounded by ray flowers. A ''ligulate head'' has all ligulate flowers. When a sunflower family flower head has only disc flowers that are sterile, male, or have both male and female parts, it is a ''discoid head''. ''Disciform heads'' have only disc flowers, but may have two kinds (male flowers and female flowers) in one head, or may have different heads of two kinds (all male, or all female). ''Pistillate heads'' have all female flowers. ''Staminate heads'' have all male flowers. Sometimes, but rarely, the head contains only a single flower, or has a single flowered pistillate (female) head, and a multi-flowered male staminate (male) head. < ref name=CDF/ > \n \n ==== Floral structures ==== \n {{More citations needed section|date=February 2021}} \n [[File:Carduus floral diagram.svg|thumb|Flower diagram of ''[[Carduus]]'' (Carduoideae) shows (outermost to innermost): subtending bract and stem axis; calyx forming a pappus; fused corolla; stamens fused to corolla; gynoecium with two carpels and one [[locule]]]] \n The distinguishing characteristic of Asteraceae is their [[inflorescence]], a type of specialised, composite flower head or ''[[pseudanthium]]'', technically called a calathium or ''[[Pseudanthium|capitulum]]'', < ref name=Beentje/ > < ref name=Usher/ >  that may look superficially like a single flower. The ''capitulum'' is a contracted [[raceme]] composed of numerous individual [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] [[flower]]s, called ''florets'', all sharing the same [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]]. \n \n A set of [[bract]]s forms an [[involucral bract|involucre]] surrounding the base of the capitulum. These are called  \" phyllaries \" , or  \" involucral bracts \" . They may simulate the [[sepal]]s of the pseudanthium. These are mostly herbaceous but can also be brightly coloured (e.g. ''[[Helichrysum]]'') or have a scarious (dry and membranous) texture. The phyllaries can be free or fused, and arranged in one to many rows, overlapping like the tiles of a roof (''imbricate'') or not (this variation is important in identification of tribes and genera). \n \n Each floret may be subtended by a bract, called a  \" palea \"  or  \" receptacular bract \" . These bracts are often called  \" [[chaff]] \" . The presence or absence of these bracts, their distribution on the receptacle, and their size and shape are all important diagnostic characteristics for genera and tribes. \n \n The florets have five [[petal]]s fused at the base to form a [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] tube and they may be either [[actinomorphic]] or [[zygomorphic]]. ''Disc florets'' are usually actinomorphic, with five petal lips on the rim of the corolla tube. The petal lips may be either very short, or long, in which case they form deeply lobed petals. The latter is the only kind of floret in the Carduoideae, while the first kind is more widespread. ''Ray florets'' are always highly zygomorphic and are characterised by the presence of a ''ligule'', a strap-shaped structure on the edge of the corolla tube consisting of fused petals. In the Asteroideae and other minor subfamilies these are usually borne only on florets at the circumference of the capitulum and have a 3+2 scheme \u2013 above the fused corolla tube, three very long fused [[petal]]s form the ligule, with the other two petals being inconspicuously small. The Cichorioideae has only ray florets, with a 5+0 scheme \u2013 all five petals form the ligule. A 4+1 scheme is found in the Barnadesioideae. The tip of the ligule is often divided into teeth, each one representing a petal. Some marginal florets may have no petals at all (filiform floret). \n \n The [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] of the florets may be absent, but when present is always modified into a [[pappus (flower structure)|pappus]] of two or more teeth, scales or bristles and this is often involved in the dispersion of the seeds. As with the bracts, the nature of the pappus is an important diagnostic feature. \n \n There are usually five [[stamen]]s. The filaments are fused to the corolla, while the anthers are generally [[connation|connate]] (''syngenesious'' anthers), thus forming a sort of tube around the style (''theca''). They commonly have basal and/or apical appendages. Pollen is released inside the tube and is collected around the growing style, and then, as the style elongates, is pushed out of the tube (''n\u00fcdelspritze''). \n \n The [[pistil]] consists of two connate [[carpel]]s. The [[carpel|style]] has two lobes. Stigmatic tissue may be located in the interior surface or form two lateral lines. The [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] is inferior and has only one [[ovule]], with basal [[placentation]]. \n \n === Fruits and seeds === \n In members of the Asteraceae the fruit is [[achene]]-like, and is called a ''cypsela'' (plural ''cypselae''). Although there are two fused [[carpel]]s, there is only one locule, and only one [[seed]] per fruit is formed. It may sometimes be winged or spiny because the [[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]], which is derived from [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]] tissue often remains on the fruit (for example in [[dandelion]]). In some species, however, the pappus falls off (for example in ''[[Helianthus]]''). Cypsela [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] is often used to help determine plant relationships at the genus and species level. < ref name=McKenzieEtAl/ >  The mature [[seed]]s usually have little [[endosperm]] or none. < ref name=Judd/ > \n \n === Pollen === \n The pollen of composites is typically echinolophate, a [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] term meaning  \" with elaborate systems of ridges and spines dispersed around and between the apertures. \" < ref name=Tomb1974/ > \n \n === Metabolites === \n In Asteraceae, the energy store is generally in the form of [[inulin]] rather than starch. They produce iso/[[chlorogenic acid]], [[sesquiterpene]] [[lactones]], pentacyclic triterpene alcohols, various [[alkaloid]]s, [[acetylene]]s (cyclic, aromatic, with vinyl end groups), [[tannin]]s. They have [[terpene|terpenoid]] [[essential oil]]s which never contain [[iridoid]]s. < ref name=Stevens/ > \n \n Asteraceae produce [[secondary metabolites]], such as [[flavonoid]]s and [[terpenoid]]s. Some of these molecules can inhibit protozoan [[parasites]] such as ''[[Plasmodium]]'', ''[[Trypanosoma]]'', ''[[Leishmania]]'' and parasitic intestinal worms, and thus have potential in medicine. < ref name=PandaLuyten2018/ > \n \n == Taxonomy == \n \n ===History=== \n Compositae, the original name for Asteraceae, were first described in 1740 by Dutch botanist [[Adriaan van Royen]].{{r|vanRoyen1740|p=117\u2013118}} Traditionally, two subfamilies were recognised: [[Asteroideae]] (or Tubuliflorae) and [[Cichorioideae]] (or Liguliflorae).{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} The latter has been shown to be extensively [[paraphyletic]], and has now been divided into 12 subfamilies, but the former still stands. < ref name=PaneroFunk/ > {{Update inline|reason=Possibly changed since 2002; see Mandel, et al (2019)|date=February 2021}} The study of this family is known as [[synantherology]]. \n \n ===Phylogeny=== \n {{See also|List of Asteraceae genera}} \n \n The [[phylogenetic tree]] presented below is based on Panero  &  [[Vicki Ann Funk|Funk]] (2002) < ref name=PaneroFunk/ >  updated in 2014, < ref name=Deep/ >  and now also includes the monotypic [[Famatinanthoideae]]. < ref name=Deep/ > < ref name=FJNG/ > < ref name=FunkFragman-Sapir/ > {{Update inline|reason=Possibly changed since 2014|date=February 2021}} \n The diamond (\u2666) denotes a very poorly supported [[cladistics|node]] ( < 50% bootstrap support), the dot (\u2022) a poorly supported node ( < 80%). < ref name=Stevens/ > \n \n {{clade|style=font-size:90%;line-height:90% \n |1={{clade|1='''[[Barnadesioideae]]''': 9 genera, 93 species.

''[[Seed dispersal#By animals|Epizoochory]]'' is another common method, in which the dispersal unit, a single cypsela (e.g. ''[[Bidens]]'') or entire capitulum (e.g. ''[[Arctium]]'') has hooks, spines or some structure to attach to the fur or plumage (or even clothes, as in the photo) of an animal just to fall off later far from its mother plant.  \n \n Some members of Asteraceae are economically important as weeds. Notable in the United States are ''[[Senecio jacobaea]]'' (ragwort), < ref name=WSNWCB/ >  ''[[Senecio vulgaris]]'' (groundsel), < ref name=WSNWCB2/ >  and ''[[Taraxacum]]'' (dandelion). < ref name=Gonzalez/ >  Some are [[invasive species]] in particular regions, often having been introduced by human agency. Examples include various [[tumbleweed]]s, ''[[Bidens]]'', [[Ambrosia (plant)|ragweeds]], [[thistle]]s, and [[Taraxacum officinale|dandelion]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} Dandelion was introduced into North America by European settlers who used the young leaves as a salad green. < ref name=dandelion/ > \n \n == Uses == \n [[File:Senecio angulatus flowers.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The [[vine|twining]] [[succulent]], ''[[Senecio angulatus]]'', is used for its [[cut flowers]], < ref name=senecioang/ >  despite being an invasive [[weed]] in some places, such as [[Victoria, Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. < ref name=senecioang2/ > ]] \n Asteraceae is an economically important family, providing products such as [[cooking oil]]s, [[leaf vegetable]]s like [[lettuce]], [[sunflower seed]]s, [[artichoke]]s, [[sweetening agent]]s, coffee substitutes and [[herbal tea]]s. Several genera are of [[horticulture|horticultural]] importance, including pot marigold (''[[Calendula officinalis]]''), ''[[Echinacea]]'' (coneflowers), various daisies, [[Erigeron|fleabane]], [[chrysanthemum]]s, [[dahlia]]s, [[zinnia]]s, and [[helenium]]s. Asteraceae are important in herbal medicine, including ''[[Grindelia]]'', [[Achillea millefolium|yarrow]], and many others.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} \n \n Commercially important plants in Asteraceae include the food crops ''[[Lactuca sativa]]'' (lettuce), ''[[Cichorium]]'' (chicory), ''[[Cynara scolymus]]'' (globe artichoke), ''[[Helianthus annuus]]'' ([[sunflower]]), ''[[Smallanthus sonchifolius]]'' (yac\u00f3n), ''[[Carthamus tinctorius]]'' (safflower) and ''[[Helianthus tuberosus]]'' (Jerusalem artichoke).{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} \n \n Plants are used as herbs and in [[herbal tea]]s and other beverages. Chamomile, for example, comes from two different species: the annual ''[[Matricaria chamomilla]]'' (German chamomile) and the perennial ''[[Chamaemelum nobile]]'' (Roman chamomile). ''[[Calendula]]'' (known as pot marigold) is grown commercially for herbal teas and [[potpourri]]. ''[[Echinacea purpurea|Echinacea]]'' is used as a medicinal tea. The wormwood genus ''[[Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia]]'' includes [[absinthe]] (''A. absinthium'') and [[tarragon]] (''A. dracunculus''). Winter tarragon (''[[Tagetes lucida]]''), is commonly grown and used as a tarragon substitute in climates where tarragon will not survive.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} \n \n Many members of the family are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers, and some are important ornamental crops for the cut flower industry. Some examples are ''[[Chrysanthemum]]'', ''[[Gerbera]]'', ''[[Calendula]]'', ''[[Dendranthema]]'', ''[[Argyranthemum]]'', ''[[Dahlia]]'', ''[[Tagetes]]'', ''[[Zinnia]]'', and many others. < ref name=Aphididae/ > \n [[File:Senecio madagascariensis plant13 (16143326805).jpg|thumb|220px|''[[Senecio madagascariensis]]'' (Fireweed) is an environmental [[weed]] in Australia, growing in wastelands, grasslands and suburban bushland. < ref name=AuldMeld1992/ > ]] \n Many species of this family possess medicinal properties and are used as traditional [[parasite|antiparasitic]] medicine. < ref name=PandaLuyten2018/ > \n \n Members of the family are also commonly featured in medical and phytochemical journals because the [[sesquiterpene]] [[lactone]] compounds contained within them are an important cause of [[allergic contact dermatitis]].
