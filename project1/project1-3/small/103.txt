The Ada & nbsp;95 revision, designed by S. Tucker Taft of [[Intermetrics]] between 1992 and 1995, improved support for systems, numerical, financial, and [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP). \n \n Features of Ada include: [[Strong and weak typing|strong typing]], [[modular programming]] mechanisms (packages), [[run-time checking]], [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]] ([[Task (computing)|tasks]], synchronous [[message passing]], protected objects, and nondeterministic [[Switch statement|select statements]]), [[exception handling]], and [[generic programming|generics]]. Ada & nbsp;95 added support for [[object-oriented programming]], including [[dynamic dispatch]]. \n \n The syntax of Ada minimizes choices of ways to perform basic operations, and prefers English keywords (such as  \" or else \"  and  \" and then \" ) to symbols (such as  \" || \"  and  \" & & \" ). Ada uses the basic arithmetical operators  \" + \" ,  \" - \" ,  \" * \" , and  \" / \" , but avoids using other symbols. Code blocks are delimited by words such as  \" declare \" ,  \" begin \" , and  \" end \" , where the  \" end \"  (in most cases) is followed by the identifier of the block it closes (e.g., ''if ... end if'', ''loop ... end loop''). In the case of conditional blocks this avoids a ''[[dangling else]]'' that could pair with the wrong nested if-expression in other languages like C or Java. \n \n Ada is designed for developing very large software systems. Ada packages can be compiled separately. Ada package specifications (the package interface) can also be compiled separately without the implementation to check for consistency. This makes it possible to detect problems early during the design phase, before implementation starts. \n \n A large number of compile-time checks are supported to help avoid bugs that would not be detectable until run-time in some other languages or would require explicit checks to be added to the source code.  For example, the syntax requires explicitly named closing of blocks to prevent errors due to mismatched end tokens. The adherence to strong typing allows detecting many common software errors (wrong parameters, range violations, invalid references, mismatched types, etc.) either during compile-time, or otherwise during run-time. As concurrency is part of the language specification, the compiler can in some cases detect potential deadlocks.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Compilers also commonly check for misspelled identifiers, visibility of packages, redundant declarations, etc. and can provide warnings and useful suggestions on how to fix the error. \n \n Ada also supports run-time checks to protect against access to unallocated memory, [[buffer overflow]] errors, range violations, [[off-by-one error]]s, array access errors, and other detectable bugs. These checks can be disabled in the interest of runtime efficiency, but can often be compiled efficiently. It also includes facilities to help [[software verification|program verification]]. For these reasons, Ada is widely used in critical systems, where any [[anomaly in software|anomaly]] might lead to very serious consequences, e.g., accidental death, injury or severe financial loss. Examples of systems where Ada is used include [[avionics]], [[air traffic control]], railways, banking, military and space technology. < ref > {{cite web|title=Ada helps churn out less-buggy code|url=http://gcn.com/Articles/1999/06/30/Ada-helps-churn-out-lessbuggy-code.aspx|publisher=Government Computer News|access-date=2010-09-14|last1=Taft|first1=S.

Ada has no generic or untyped [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]]; nor does it implicitly declare any pointer type. Instead, all dynamic memory allocation and deallocation must occur via explicitly declared ''access types''. Each access type has an associated ''storage pool'' that handles the low-level details of memory management; the programmer can either use the default storage pool or define new ones (this is particularly relevant for [[Non-Uniform Memory Access]]). It is even possible to declare several different access types that all designate the same type but use different storage pools. Also, the language provides for ''accessibility checks'', both at compile time and at run time, that ensures that an ''access value'' cannot outlive the type of the object it points to. < ref > [https://youtube.com/watch?v=RyY01fRyGhM & t=419 no safe dynamic memory management in ADA], in: Writing Linux Kernel Modules in Safe Rust - Geoffrey Thomas  &  Alex Gaynor \n , The Linux Foundation, 2019-10-02 < /ref > \n \n Though the semantics of the language allow automatic [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] of inaccessible objects, most implementations do not support it by default, as it would cause unpredictable behaviour in real-time systems.  Ada does support a limited form of [[region-based memory management]]; also, creative use of storage pools can provide for a limited form of automatic garbage collection, since destroying a storage pool also destroys all the objects in the pool. \n \n A double-[[dash]] ( \" -- \" ), resembling an [[em dash]], denotes comment text.  Comments stop at end of line, to prevent unclosed comments from accidentally voiding whole sections of source code.  Disabling a whole block of code now requires the prefixing of each line (or column) individually with  \" -- \" . While clearly denoting disabled code with a column of repeated  \" -- \"  down the page this renders the experimental dis/re-enablement of large blocks a more drawn out process. \n \n The semicolon ( \" ; \" ) is a [[statement terminator]], and the null or no-operation statement is  < code > null; < /code > . A single  < code > ; < /code >  without a statement to terminate is not allowed. \n \n Unlike most [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards, the Ada language definition (known as the ''Ada Reference Manual'' or ''ARM'', or sometimes the ''Language Reference Manual'' or ''LRM'') is [[free content]]. Thus, it is a common reference for Ada programmers, not only programmers implementing Ada compilers. Apart from the reference manual, there is also an extensive rationale document which explains the language design and the use of various language constructs. This document is also widely used by programmers. When the language was revised, a new rationale document was written. \n \n One notable [[free software]] tool that is used by many Ada programmers to aid them in writing Ada source code is the [[GNAT Programming Studio]], part of the [[GNU Compiler Collection]]. \n \n == History == \n In the 1970s the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] (DoD) became concerned by the number of different programming languages being used for its embedded computer system projects, many of which were obsolete or hardware-dependent, and none of which supported safe modular programming. In 1975, a [[working group]], the [[High Order Language Working Group]] (HOLWG), was formed with the intent to reduce this number by finding or creating a programming language generally suitable for the department's and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Defence]]'s requirements. After many iterations beginning with an original [http://iment.com/maida/computer/requirements/strawman.htm Straw man proposal] the eventual programming language was named Ada. The total number of high-level programming languages in use for such projects fell from over 450 in 1983 to 37 by 1996. \n \n The HOLWG working group crafted the [[Steelman language requirements]], a series of documents stating the requirements they felt a programming language should satisfy. Many existing languages were formally reviewed, but the team concluded in 1977 that no existing language met the specifications. \n \n Requests for proposals for a new programming language were issued and four contractors were hired to develop their proposals under the names of Red ([[Intermetrics]] led by Benjamin Brosgol), Green ([[CII Honeywell Bull]], led by [[Jean Ichbiah]]), Blue ([[SofTech, Inc.|SofTech]], led by John Goodenough) < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/people/jbg.cfm |title=John Goodenough  & #124; SEI Staff Profile |publisher=Sei.cmu.edu |access-date=2014-01-27}} < /ref >  and Yellow ([[SRI International]], led by Jay Spitzen). < !-- Though Intermetrics and Bull have previous links, I am including them for parallelism. -- >  In April 1978, after public scrutiny, the Red and Green proposals passed to the next phase. In May 1979, the Green proposal, designed by Jean Ichbiah at CII Honeywell Bull, was chosen and given the name Ada\u2014after [[Ada Lovelace|Augusta Ada, Countess of Lovelace]]. This proposal was influenced by the language [[LIS (programming language)|LIS]] that Ichbiah and his group had developed in the 1970s. The preliminary Ada reference manual was published in ACM SIGPLAN Notices in June 1979. The Military Standard reference manual was approved on December 10, 1980 ([[Ada Lovelace]]'s birthday), and given the number MIL-STD-1815 in honor of Ada Lovelace's birth year. In 1981, [[C. A. R. Hoare]] took advantage of his [[Turing Award]] speech to criticize Ada for being overly complex and hence unreliable, < ref > {{cite journal |last=C.A.R. |first=Hoare |author-link=Tony Hoare |url=http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs422/2011/bib/hoare81emperor.pdf |title=The Emperor's Old Clothes |journal=Communications of the ACM |date=1981 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=75\u201383 |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]]|doi=10.1145/358549.358561 |s2cid=97895 |doi-access=free }} < /ref >  but subsequently seemed to recant in the foreword he wrote for an Ada textbook. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Watt |first1=D.A. |last2=Wichmann |first2=B.A. |last3=Findlay |first3=W. |title=Ada: Language and Methodology |publisher=Prentice-Hall |date=1987}} < /ref > \n \n Ada attracted much attention from the programming community as a whole during its early days.

However, Ada also has many data structuring facilities and other abstractions which were not included in the original [[ALGOL 60]], such as [[type system|type definitions]], [[record (computer science)|records]], [[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]], [[enumerated type|enumerations]]. Such constructs were in part inherited from or inspired by [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. \n \n ===  \" Hello, world! \"  in Ada === \n A common example of a language's [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] is the [[Hello world program]]: \n (hello.adb) \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" ada \" > \n with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO; \n procedure Hello is \n begin \n    Put_Line ( \" Hello, world! \" ); \n end Hello; \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n This program can be compiled by using the freely available open source compiler [[GNAT]], by executing \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" bash \" > gnatmake hello.adb < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n === Data types === \n Ada's type system is not based on a set of predefined [[primitive types]] but allows users to declare their own types. This declaration in turn is not based on the internal representation of the type but on describing the goal which should be achieved. This allows the compiler to determine a suitable memory size for the type, and to check for violations of the type definition at compile time and run time (i.e., range violations, buffer overruns, type consistency, etc.). Ada supports numerical types defined by a range, modulo types, aggregate types (records and arrays), and enumeration types. Access types define a reference to an instance of a specified type; untyped pointers are not permitted. \n Special types provided by the language are task types and protected types. \n \n For example, a date might be represented as: \n \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" ada \" > \n type Day_type   is range    1 ..   31; \n type Month_type is range    1 ..   12; \n type Year_type  is range 1800 .. 2100; \n type Hours is mod 24; \n type Weekday is (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday); \n \n type Date is \n    record \n      Day   : Day_type; \n      Month : Month_type; \n      Year  : Year_type; \n    end record; \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n Types can be refined by declaring subtypes: \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" ada \" > \n subtype Working_Hours is Hours range 0 .. 12;            -- at most 12 Hours to work a day \n subtype Working_Day is Weekday range Monday .. Friday;   -- Days to work \n \n Work_Load: constant array(Working_Day) of Working_Hours  -- implicit type declaration \n    := (Friday = >  6, Monday = >  4, others = >  10);           -- lookup table for working hours with initialization \n \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n Types can have modifiers such as ''limited, abstract, private'' etc. Private types can only be accessed and limited types can only be modified or copied within the scope of the package that defines them. < ref > {{cite web |title=Ada Syntax Card |url=http://www.digilife.be/quickreferences/QRC/Ada%20Syntax%20Card.pdf |access-date=28 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133825/http://www.digilife.be/quickreferences/QRC/Ada%20Syntax%20Card.pdf |archive-date=6 July 2011}} < /ref >  Ada 95 adds further features for object-oriented extension of types. \n \n === Control structures === \n Ada is a [[structured programming]] language, meaning that the flow of control is structured into standard statements. All standard constructs and deep-level early exit are supported, so the use of the also supported  \" [[goto (command)|go to]] \"  commands is seldom needed. \n \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" ada \" > \n -- while a is not equal to b, loop. \n while a /= b loop \n   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ( \" Waiting \" ); \n end loop; \n \n if a  >  b then \n   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ( \" Condition met \" ); \n else \n   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ( \" Condition not met \" ); \n end if; \n \n for i in 1 .. 10 loop \n   Ada.Text_IO.Put ( \" Iteration:  \" ); \n   Ada.Text_IO.Put (i); \n   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line; \n end loop; \n \n loop \n   a := a + 1; \n   exit when a = 10; \n end loop; \n \n case i is \n   when 0 = >  Ada.Text_IO.Put ( \" zero \" ); \n   when 1 = >  Ada.Text_IO.Put ( \" one \" ); \n   when 2 = >  Ada.Text_IO.Put ( \" two \" ); \n   -- case statements have to cover all possible cases: \n   when others = >  Ada.Text_IO.Put ( \" none of the above \" ); \n end case; \n \n for aWeekday in Weekday'Range loop               -- loop over an enumeration \n    Put_Line ( Weekday'Image(aWeekday) );         -- output string representation of an enumeration \n    if aWeekday in Working_Day then               -- check of a subtype of an enumeration \n       Put_Line (  \"  to work for  \"   & \n                Working_Hours'Image (Work_Load(aWeekday)) ); -- access into a lookup table \n    end if; \n end loop; \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n === Packages, procedures and functions === \n Among the parts of an Ada program are packages, procedures and functions. \n \n Example: \n Package specification (example.ads) \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" ada \" > \n package Example is \n      type Number is range 1 .. 11; \n      procedure Print_and_Increment (j: in out Number); \n end Example; \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n Package body (example.adb) \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" ada \" > \n with Ada.Text_IO; \n package body Example is \n \n   i : Number := Number'First; \n \n   procedure Print_and_Increment (j: in out Number) is \n \n     function Next (k: in Number) return Number is \n     begin \n       return k + 1; \n     end Next; \n \n   begin \n     Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (  \" The total is:  \"   &  Number'Image(j) ); \n     j := Next (j); \n   end Print_and_Increment; \n \n -- package initialization executed when the package is elaborated \n begin \n   while i  <  Number'Last loop \n     Print_and_Increment (i); \n   end loop; \n end Example; \n < /syntaxhighlight > \n This program can be compiled, e.g., by using the freely available open-source compiler [[GNAT]], by executing \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" bash \" > gnatmake -z example.adb < /syntaxhighlight > \n \n Packages, procedures and functions can nest to any depth, and each can also be the logical outermost block. \n \n Each package, procedure or function can have its own declarations of constants, types, variables, and other procedures, functions and packages, which can be declared in any order. \n \n === Concurrency === \n Ada has language support for task-based concurrency. The fundamental concurrent unit in Ada is a ''task'', which is a built-in limited type. Tasks are specified in two parts \u2013 the task declaration defines the task interface (similar to a type declaration), the task body specifies the implementation of the task. Depending on the implementation, Ada tasks are either mapped to operating system threads or processes, or are scheduled internally by the Ada runtime. \n \n Tasks can have entries for synchronisation (a form of [[message passing|synchronous message passing]]). Task entries are declared in the task specification. Each task entry can have one or more ''accept'' statements within the task body. If the control flow of the task reaches an accept statement, the task is blocked until the corresponding entry is called by another task (similarly, a calling task is blocked until the called task reaches the corresponding accept statement). Task entries can have parameters similar to procedures, allowing tasks to synchronously exchange data. In conjunction with ''select'' statements it is possible to define ''guards'' on accept statements (similar to Dijkstra's [[guarded commands]]). \n \n Ada also offers ''[[protected object]]s'' for [[mutual exclusion]]. Protected objects are a [[Monitor (synchronization)|monitor-like]] construct, but use guards instead of conditional variables for signaling (similar to conditional critical regions). Protected objects combine the data encapsulation and safe mutual exclusion from monitors, and entry guards from conditional critical regions.  The main advantage over classical monitors is that conditional variables are not required for signaling, avoiding potential deadlocks due to incorrect locking semantics. Like tasks, the protected object is a built-in limited type, and it also has a declaration part and a body. \n \n A protected object consists of encapsulated private data (which can only be accessed from within the protected object), and procedures, functions and entries which are guaranteed to be mutually exclusive (with the only exception of functions, which are required to be side effect free and can therefore run concurrently with other functions). A task calling a protected object is blocked if another task is currently executing inside the same protected object, and released when this other task leaves the protected object. Blocked tasks are queued on the protected object ordered by time of arrival. \n \n Protected object entries are similar to procedures, but additionally have ''guards''. If a guard evaluates to false, a calling task is blocked and added to the queue of that entry; now another task can be admitted to the protected object, as no task is currently executing inside the protected object. Guards are re-evaluated whenever a task leaves the protected object, as this is the only time when the evaluation of guards can have changed. \n \n Calls to entries can be ''requeued'' to other entries with the same signature. A task that is requeued is blocked and added to the queue of the target entry; this means that the protected object is released and allows admission of another task. \n \n The ''select'' statement in Ada can be used to implement non-blocking entry calls and accepts, non-deterministic selection of entries (also with guards), time-outs and aborts. \n \n The following example illustrates some concepts of concurrent programming in Ada. \n < syntaxhighlight lang= \" ada \" > \n with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO; \n \n procedure Traffic is \n \n    type Airplane_ID is range 1..10;             -- 10 airplanes \n \n    task type Airplane (ID: Airplane_ID);        -- task representing airplanes, with ID as initialisation parameter \n    type Airplane_Access is access Airplane;     -- reference type to Airplane \n \n    protected type Runway is                     -- the shared runway (protected to allow concurrent access) \n       entry Assign_Aircraft (ID: Airplane_ID);  -- all entries are guaranteed mutually exclusive \n       entry Cleared_Runway (ID: Airplane_ID); \n       entry Wait_For_Clear; \n    private \n       Clear: Boolean := True;                   -- protected private data - generally more than only a flag... \n    end Runway; \n    type Runway_Access is access all Runway; \n \n    -- the air traffic controller task takes requests for takeoff and landing \n    task type Controller (My_Runway: Runway_Access) is \n       -- task entries for synchronous message passing \n       entry Request_Takeoff (ID: in Airplane_ID; Takeoff: out Runway_Access); \n       entry Request_Approach(ID: in Airplane_ID; Approach: out Runway_Access); \n    end Controller; \n \n    --  allocation of instances \n    Runway1    : aliased Runway;

\n       end; \n \n       entry Wait_For_Clear \n  when Clear is \n       begin \n          null;      -- no need to do anything here - a task can only enter if  \" Clear \"  is true \n       end; \n    end Runway;
