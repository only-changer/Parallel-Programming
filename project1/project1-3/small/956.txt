Carmel Hill belongs to the mountain range of [[Collserola]] \u2013 the [[Parc del Carmel]] is located on the northern face. Park G\u00fcell is located in [[La Salut]], a neighborhood in the [[Gr\u00e0cia district]] of Barcelona. With urbanization in mind, [[Eusebi G\u00fcell]] assigned the design of the park to [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]], a renowned architect and the face of [[Catalan modernism]]. \n \n The park was built from 1900 to 1914 and was officially opened as a public park in 1926. In 1984, [[UNESCO]] declared the park a [[World Heritage Site]] under  \" [[Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed]] \" . < ref name=gaudiunesco > {{Citation | title =Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed |publisher = Unesco| url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/320 | access-date = 15 July 2011}} < /ref > \n \n ==Description== \n {{Original research|section|date=April 2016}} \n Park G\u00fcell is the reflection of Gaud\u00ed's artistic plenitude, which belongs to his [[naturalist]] phase (first decade of the 20th century). During this period, the architect perfected his personal style through inspiration from organic shapes. He put into practice a series of new structural solutions rooted in the analysis of geometry. To that, the Catalan artist adds creative liberty and an imaginative, ornamental creation. Starting from a sort of baroquism, his works acquire a structural richness of forms and volumes, free of the rational rigidity or any sort of classic premises. In the design of Park G\u00fcell, Gaud\u00ed unleashed all his architectonic genius and put to practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would become the symbol of his organic style and that would culminate in the creation of the [[Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family]] (Catalan: [[Sagrada Familia]]). \n \n G\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed conceived this park, situated within a natural park. They imagined an organized grouping of high-quality homes, decked out with all the latest technological advancements to ensure maximum comfort, finished off with an artistic touch. They also envisioned a community strongly influenced by [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], since, in the common elements of the park, they were trying to synthesize many of the political and religious ideals shared by patron and architect: therefore there are noticeable concepts originating from political [[Catalanism]] \u2013  especially in the entrance stairway where the [[Catalan countries]] are represented \u2013 and from [[Catholicism]] \u2013 the [[Monumento al Calvario]], originally designed to be a [[chapel]]. The [[mythological]] elements are so important: apparently G\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed's conception of the park was also inspired by the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] of [[Delphi]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} \n \n On the other hand, many experts{{Who|date=April 2016}} have tried to link the park to various symbols because of the complex [[iconography]] that Gaud\u00ed applied to the urban project. Such references go from political vindication to [[religious]] exaltation, passing through [[mythology]], [[history]] and [[philosophy]]. Specifically, many studies claim to see references to [[Freemasonry]], despite the deep religious beliefs of both Gaud\u00ed and Count G\u00fcell. These references have not been proven in the [[historiography]] of the modern architect. The multiplicity of symbols found in the Park G\u00fcell is, as previously mentioned, associated to political and religious signs, with a touch of mystery according to the preferences of that time for enigmas and [[puzzles]]. \n \n ==Origins as a housing development== \n [[File:Barcelona 193.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Gaudi House Museum]]]] \n The park was originally part of a commercially unsuccessful housing site, the idea of Count [[Eusebi G\u00fcell]], after whom the park was named. It was inspired by the English [[garden city movement]]; hence the original English name ''Park'' (in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] the name is  \" Parc G\u00fcell \" ). The site was a rocky hill with little vegetation and few trees, called ''Muntanya Pelada'' (Bare Mountain). It already included a large country house called Larrard House or Muntaner de Dalt House and was next to a neighbourhood of upper-class houses called ''La Salut'' (The Health). The intention was to exploit the fresh air (well away from smoky factories) and beautiful views from the site, with sixty triangular lots being provided for luxury houses. Count Eusebi G\u00fcell added to the prestige of the development by moving in 1906 to live in Larrard House. Ultimately, only two houses were built, neither designed by Gaud\u00ed. One was intended to be a show house, but on being completed in 1904 was put up for sale, and as no buyers came forward, Gaud\u00ed, at G\u00fcell's suggestion, bought it with his savings and moved in with his family and his father in 1906. < ref name=zim > {{Citation | last = Zimmermann | first = Robert | year =2002 | title =The Best of Gaud\u00ed | url =http://www.sola-sole.com/bgaudi.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702205603/http://www.sola-sole.com/bgaudi.pdf|archive-date=2 July 2007}} < /ref >  This house, where Gaud\u00ed lived from 1906 to 1926 (his death), was built by Francesc Berenguer in 1904. It contains original works by Gaud\u00ed and several of his collaborators. It is now the [[Gaudi House Museum]] (Casa Museu Gaud\u00ed) since 1963. In 1969 it was declared a historical artistic monument of national interest. \n \n == Municipal garden == \n [[File:Parc G\u00fcell Dragon Restored.jpg|left|thumb|Gaud\u00ed's multicolored [[mosaic]] salamander, popularly known as  \" el drac \"  (the dragon), at the main entrance, as restored after the vandalism of February 2007]] \n [[File:Park Guell Terrace.JPG|left|thumb|Gaud\u00ed's mosaic work on the main terrace]] \n \n It has since been converted into a municipal garden. It can be reached by underground railway (although the stations are at a distance from the Park and at a much lower level below the hill), by city buses, or by commercial tourist buses. Since October 2013 there is an entrance fee to visit the Monumental Zone (main entrance, terrace, and the parts containing mosaics), but the entrance to the Park remains free. Gaud\u00ed's house,  \" la Torre Rosa, \"  \u2013 containing furniture that he designed \u2013 can be only visited for another entrance fee. There is a reduced rate for those wishing to see both Gaud\u00ed's house and the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]] Church. \n \n Park G\u00fcell is designed and composed to bring the peace and calm that one would expect from a park. The buildings flanking the entrance, though very original and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles, fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by Gaud\u00ed. These two buildings make up the Porter's Lodge pavilion. < ref > https://parkguell.barcelona/en/park-guell/emblematic-features/entrance-pavilions < /ref >  One of these buildings contains a small room with a telephone booth.  The other, while once being the porter's house, is now a permanent exhibition of the [[Barcelona City History Museum]] MUHBA focused on the building itself, the park and the city. < ref > {{cite web|title=MUHBA Park G\u00fcell|url=http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/museuhistoria/en/muhba-park-guell}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXEGigoEa5k|title=LMVC UPC CPSV.

The curves of the serpent bench form a number of enclaves, creating a more social atmosphere. Gaud\u00ed incorporated many motifs of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] nationalism, and elements from religious mysticism and ancient poetry, into the Park. Much of the design of the benches was the work not of Gaud\u00ed but of his often overlooked collaborator [[Josep Maria Jujol]]. < ref > {{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/sep/09/gaudis-partner-in-iconic-barcelona-design-finally-gets-the-limelight |title=Gaud\u00ed's partner in iconic Barcelona design finally gets the limelight |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Stephen |last=Burgen |date=2016-09-09 |access-date=2016-09-09}} < /ref > \n \n Roadways around the park to service the intended houses were designed by Gaud\u00ed as structures jutting out from the steep hillside or running on viaducts, with separate footpaths in arcades formed under these structures. This minimized the intrusion of the roads, and Gaud\u00ed designed them using local stone in a way that integrates them closely into the landscape. His structures echo natural forms, with columns like tree trunks supporting branching [[vault (architecture)|vaulting]] under the roadway, and the curves of vaulting and alignment of sloping columns designed in a similar way to his [[Church of Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell]] so that the [[Inverted catenary|inverted catenary arch]] shapes form perfect compression structures. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://dataphys.org/list/gaudis-hanging-chain-models/ |title=1889 \u2013 Gaud\u00ed's Hanging Chain Models |website=List of Physical Visualizations |access-date=8 June 2017}} < /ref > \n \n At the park's high-point, there is a stone hill composed of steps leading up to a platform which holds three large crosses. The official name of this is  \" El Tur\u00f3 de les Tres Creus, \"  however many tourists choose to call it Calvary. Two of the crosses point north\u2013south and east\u2013west, the third, and tallest cross, points skyward. This lookout offers the most complete view of Barcelona and the bay. It is possible to view the main city in panorama, with the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (another one of Antoni Guad\u00ed's famous creations), the Agbar Tower, and the [[Montju\u00efc]] area visible at a distance. \n < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.tripindicator.com/park-guell-barcelona-map-tickets-tours.html |title=Complete guide to Gaudi Park |access-date=8 March 2021}} < /ref > \n \n The park supports a wide variety of wildlife, notably several of the non-native species of [[parrot]] found in the Barcelona area. Other birds can be seen from the park, with records including [[Short-toed snake eagle|short-toed eagle]]. The park also supports a population of [[Macroglossum stellatarum|hummingbird hawk moths]]. \n {{clear left}} \n \n ==Gallery of images== \n < gallery > \n File:View from Park G\u00fcell Terrace.jpg| View from the main terrace of the park. \n File:Goelenterance06390139.JPG|Entrance to the Park. \n File:Goeldoric06390141.JPG|Doric columns support the roof of the lower court which forms the central terrace, with serpentine seating round its edge. \n File:Goelbench06390140.JPG|The unique shape of the serpentine bench enables the people sitting on it to converse privately, although the square is large. The bench is tiled and in order to dry up quickly after it rains, and to stop people from sitting in the wet part of the bench, small bumps were installed by Gaud\u00ed. \n \n File:Goelbirdnests06390137.JPG|Bird nests built by Gaud\u00ed in the terrace walls.
