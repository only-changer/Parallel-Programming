Founded by [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]], the Almoravid capital was [[Marrakesh]], a city the ruling house founded in 1062. The dynasty originated among the [[Lamtuna]] and the [[Godala|Gudala]], nomadic Berber tribes of the [[Sahara]], traversing the territory between the [[Draa River|Draa]], the [[Niger River|Niger]], and the [[Senegal river|Senegal]] rivers. < ref > Extract from [http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/A912241/ALMORAVIDES.htm ''Encyclopedia Universalis on Almoravids'']. < /ref > \n \n The Almoravids were crucial in preventing the fall of [[Al-Andalus]] to the [[Iberia]]n Christian kingdoms, when they decisively defeated a coalition of the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] armies at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]] in 1086. This enabled them to control an empire that stretched 3,000 kilometers (1,900 & nbsp;mi) north to south. However, the rule of the dynasty was relatively short-lived. The Almoravids fell\u2014at the height of their power\u2014when they failed to stop the [[Masmuda]]-led rebellion initiated by [[Ibn Tumart]]. As a result, their last king [[Ishaq ibn Ali]] was killed in Marrakesh in April 1147 by the [[Almohad Caliphate]], which replaced them as a ruling dynasty both in Morocco and [[Al-Andalus]]. \n \n ==Name== \n The term  \" Almoravid \"  comes from the [[Arabic]]  \" al-Murabit \"  ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0637}}), through the {{lang-es|almor\u00e1vide}}. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/almoravid|title=Almoravid {{!}} Definition of Almoravid by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}} < /ref >  The transformation of the ''b'' in  \" al-Murabit \"  to the ''v'' in ''almor\u00e1vide'' is an example of [[betacism]] in Spanish. \n \n In Arabic,  \" al-Murabit \"  literally means  \" one who is tying \"  but figuratively means  \" one who is ready for battle at a fortress \" . The term is related to the notion of ''[[ribat]]'' {{Lang|ar|\u0631\u0650\u0628\u0627\u0637}}, a North African frontier monastery-fortress, through the [[Semitic root|root]] [[wiktionary:\u0631 \u0628 \u0637|r-b-t]] ({{lang|ar|\u0631\u0628\u0637}}  \" rabat \" : ''to tie , to unite'' or {{lang|ar|\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0637}}  \" raabat \" : ''to encamp''). < ref > [[Nehemia Levtzion]],  \" Abd Allah b.

Ibn Zallu sent his student [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] to preach Malikite Islam to the Sanhaja Berbers of the Sous and [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] (present-day [[Mauritania]]). Hence, the name of the Almoravids comes from the followers of the Dar al-Murabitin,  \" the house of those who were bound together in the cause of God. \" < ref > Messier, Ronald A. ''The Almoravids and the meanings of jihad'', Santa Barbara, CA. Praeger Publishers, 2010. < /ref > \n \n It is uncertain exactly when or why the Almoravids acquired that appellation. [[al-Bakri]], writing in 1068, before their apex, already calls them the ''al-Murabitun'', but does not clarify the reasons for it. Writing three centuries later, [[Ibn Abi Zar]] suggested it was chosen early on by [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] < ref > [[#Rawd|Ibn Abi Zar, p. 81]]. < /ref >  because, upon finding resistance among the Gudala Berbers of Adrar (Mauritania) to his teaching, he took a handful of followers to erect a makeshift ''ribat'' (monastery-fortress) on an offshore island (possibly [[Tidra]] island, in the [[Bay of Arguin]]). < ref > Ibn Abi Zar's account is translated in N. Levtzion and J. F. P. Hopkins, eds (2000), ''Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History'', University of Ghana,pp. 239ff. For tentative identification of the ''ribat'', see Moraes Farias (1967). < /ref >  [[Ibn Idhari]] wrote that the name was suggested by Ibn Yasin in the  \" persevering in the fight \"  sense, to boost morale after a particularly hard-fought battle in the [[Draa]] valley c. 1054, in which they had taken many losses. Whichever explanation is true, it seems certain the appellation was chosen by the Almoravids for themselves, partly with the conscious goal of forestalling any tribal or ethnic identifications. \n \n The name might be related to the ''ribat'' of [[Waggag ibn Zallu al-Lamti|Waggag ibn Zallu]] in the village of [[Tnine Aglou|Aglu]] (near present-day [[Tiznit]]), where the future Almoravid spiritual leader Abdallah ibn Yasin got his initial training. The 13th-century Moroccan biographer [[Ibn al-Zayyat al-Tadili]], and [[Qadi Ayyad]] before him in the 12th century, note that Waggag's learning center was called ''Dar al-Murabitin'' (The house of the Almoravids), and that might have inspired Ibn Yasin's choice of name for the movement. < ref > {{cite book|last=Ibn al-Zayyat|title=\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0634\u0648\u0641 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0635\u0648\u0641|year=1220|page=89|author-link=Ibn al-Zayyat al-Tadili|trans-title=Looking to know the men of Sufism}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book|last=Qadi Ayyad|title=\u062a\u0631\u062a\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0648\u062a\u0646\u0648\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0643 \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0623\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0630\u0647\u0628 \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643.|pages=839\u201340|author-link=Qadi Ayyad|trans-title=Biographies of Eminent Maliki Scholars}} < /ref > \n \n Contemporaries frequently referred to them as the ''al-mulathimun'' ( \" the veiled ones \" , from ''[[litham]]'', [[Arabic]] for  \" veil \" ). The Almoravids veiled themselves below the eyes with a [[tagelmust]], a custom they adapted from southern [[Sanhaja]] Berbers. (This can still be seen among the modern [[Tuareg people]], but it was unusual further north.) Although practical for the desert dust, the Almoravids insisted on wearing the veil everywhere, as a badge of  \" foreignness \"  in urban settings, partly as a way of emphasizing their puritan credentials. It served as the uniform of the Almoravids. Under their rule, [[sumptuary law]]s forbade anybody else from wearing the veil, thereby making it the distinctive dress of the ruling class. In turn, the succeeding [[Almohads]] made a point of mocking the Almoravid veil as symbolic of [[effeminacy]] and decadence. \n \n ==History== \n \n ===Origins=== \n The Berbers of the [[Maghreb]] in the early Middle Ages could be roughly classified into three major groups: the [[Zenata]] across the north, the [[Masmuda]], concentrated in central Morocco, and the Sanhaja, clustered in the western part of the [[Sahara]] and the hills of the eastern Maghreb. < ref > {{cite book|author=\u02bbAbd al-W\u0101\u1e25id Dhann\u016bn \u1e6c\u0101h\u0101|title=The Muslim conquest and settlement of North Africa and Spain|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0-415-00474-8}} ({{google books|TgcOAAAAQAAJ|online}}) < /ref > < ref > Mones (1988), p. 119; (1992), p. 228. < /ref >  The eastern Sanhaja included the [[Kutama]] Berbers, who had been the base of the [[Fatimid]] rise in the early 10th century, and the [[Zirid dynasty]], who ruled [[Ifriqiya]] as vassals of the Fatimids after the latter moved to Egypt in 972. The western [[Sanhaja]] were divided into several tribes: the Gazzula and the [[Lamta]] in the [[Draa valley]] and the foothills of the [[Anti-Atlas]] range; further south, encamped in the western [[Sahara]], were the Massufa, the [[Lamtuna]] and the Banu Warith; and most southerly of all, the Gudala, in littoral [[Mauritania]] down to the borderlands of the [[Senegal River]]. \n \n The western Sanhaja had been converted to [[Islam]] some time in the 9th century. They were subsequently united in the 10th century and, with the zeal of new converts, launched several campaigns against the  \" [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]ese \"  (pagan peoples of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]). < ref > Lewicki (1988), pp. 160\u201361; (1992), pp. 308\u201309. < /ref >  Under their king Tinbarutan ibn Usfayshar, the Sanhaja Lamtuna erected (or captured) the citadel of [[Awdaghust]], a critical stop on the [[trans-Saharan trade]] route. After the collapse of the Sanhaja union, Awdagust passed over to the [[Ghana empire]]; and the trans-Saharan routes were taken over by the Zenata [[Maghrawa]] of [[Sijilmassa]]. The Maghrawa also exploited this disunion to dislodge the Sanhaja Gazzula and Lamta out of their pasturelands in the Sous and Draa valleys. Around 1035, the Lamtuna chieftain Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Tifat (alias Tarsina), tried to reunite the Sanhaja desert tribes, but his reign lasted less than three years. \n [[File:Almoravid Empire.png|thumb|The Almoravid empire at its height stretched from the city of [[Aoudaghost]] to the [[Taifa of Zaragoza|Zaragoza]] in Al-Andalus]] \n Around 1040, [[Yahya ibn Ibrahim]], a chieftain of the Gudala (and brother-in-law of the late Tarsina), went on [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]. On his return, he stopped by [[Kairouan]] in [[Ifriqiya]], where he met [[Abu Imran al-Fasi]], a native of [[Fes]] and a jurist and scholar of the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki]] school. At this time, Ifriqiya was in ferment. The [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]] ruler, [[al-Muizz ibn Badis]], was openly contemplating breaking with his [[Shi'ite]] [[Fatimid]] overlords in Cairo, and the jurists of Kairouan were agitating for him to do so. Within this heady atmosphere, Yahya and Abu Imran fell into conversation on the state of the faith in their western homelands, and Yahya expressed his disappointment at the lack of religious education and negligence of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] among his southern Sanhaja people. With Abu Imran's recommendation, Yahya ibn Ibrahim made his way to the ''ribat'' of Waggag ibn Zelu in the [[Sous]] valley of southern Morocco, to seek out a Maliki teacher for his people. Waggag assigned him one of his residents, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]]. \n \n Abdallah ibn Yasin was a Gazzula Berber, and probably a convert rather than a born Muslim. His name can be read as  \" son of [[Ya Sin]] \"  (the title of the 36th [[Sura]] of the [[Qur'an]]), suggesting he had obliterated his family past and was  \" re-born \"  of the Holy Book. < ref > M. Brett and E. Fentress (1996), ''The Berbers'', Oxford: Blackwell, p. 100. Revealingly, the 36th Sura begins the salutation  \" You are one of messengers \"  and the imperative duty to set people  \" on the straight path \" . Ibn Yasin's choice of name was probably not a coincidence. < /ref >  Ibn Yasin certainly had the ardor of a puritan zealot; his creed was mainly characterized by a rigid formalism and a strict adherence to the dictates of the [[Qur'an]], and the [[Sunnah|Orthodox tradition]]. < ref name= \" shilling88 \"  / >  (Chroniclers such as al-Bakri allege Ibn Yasin's learning was superficial.) Ibn Yasin's initial meetings with the Gudala people went poorly. As he had more ardor than depth, Ibn Yasin's arguments were disputed by his audience. He responded to questioning with charges of apostasy and handed out harsh punishments for the slightest deviations. The Gudala soon had enough and expelled him almost immediately after the death of his protector, Yahya ibn Ibrahim, sometime in the 1040s. \n \n Ibn Yasin, however, found a more favorable reception among the neighboring Lamtuna people. < ref name= \" shilling88 \" > {{cite book|last=Shillington|first=Kevin|title=History of Africa|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-333-59957-0|page=88}} < /ref >  Probably sensing the useful organizing power of Ibn Yasin's pious fervor, the Lamtuna chieftain [[Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni]] invited the man to preach to his people. The Lamtuna leaders, however, kept Ibn Yasin on a careful leash, forging a more productive partnership between them. Invoking stories of the early life of Muhammad, Ibn Yasin preached that conquest was a necessary addendum to Islamicization, that it was not enough to merely adhere to God's law, but necessary to also destroy opposition to it. In Ibn Yasin's ideology, anything and everything outside of Islamic law could be characterized as  \" opposition \" . He identified tribalism, in particular, as an obstacle. He believed it was not enough to urge his audiences to put aside their blood loyalties and ethnic differences, and embrace the equality of all Muslims under the Sacred Law, it was necessary to make them do so. For the Lamtuna leadership, this new ideology dovetailed with their long desire to refound the Sanhaja union and recover their lost dominions. In the early 1050s, the Lamtuna, under the joint leadership of Yahya ibn Umar and Abdallah ibn Yasin\u2014soon calling themselves the ''al-Murabitin'' (Almoravids)\u2014set out on a campaign to bring their neighbors over to their cause. \n \n ===Conquests=== \n {{Campaignbox Almoravid Empire battles}} \n \n ====Northern Africa==== \n From 1053, the Almoravids began to spread their religious way to the Berber areas of the Sahara, and to the regions south of the desert. After winning over the [[Sanhaja]] Berber tribe, they quickly took control of the entire desert trade route, seizing [[Sijilmasa]] at the northern end in 1054, and [[Aoudaghost]] at the southern end in 1055. Yahya ibn Umar was killed in a battle in 1057, < ref name= \" shilling90 \" > Shillington, p. 90. < /ref >  but Abdullah ibn Yasin, whose influence as a religious teacher was paramount, named his brother [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]] as chief. Under him, the Almoravids soon began to spread their power beyond the desert, and conquered the tribes of the [[Atlas Mountains]]. They then came in contact with the [[Berghouata]], a Berber tribal confederation, who followed an Islamic  \" heresy \"  preached by [[Salih ibn Tarif]] three centuries earlier. The Berghouata resisted. Abdullah ibn Yasin was killed in battle with them in 1059, in Krifla, a village near [[Rommani]], [[Morocco]]. They were, however, completely conquered by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, and were forced to convert to orthodox Islam.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=717}} Abu Bakr married a noble and wealthy Berber woman, [[Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyat]], who would become very influential in the development of the dynasty. < ref name=ZAR87 > [[#Rawd|Ibn Abi Zar, p. 87]]. < /ref >  Zaynab was the daughter of a wealthy merchant from Houara, who was said to be from [[Kairouan]]. < ref name=ZAR87/ > \n \n [[File:Camel Rider 1413 Mecia Viladestes map.jpg|thumb|A 15th century depiction of the 11th century Almoravid general [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]] ( \" Rex Bubecar \" ) near the [[Senegal River]] in 1413 Majorcan chart. Abu Bakr was known for his conquests in Africa.]] \n \n In 1061, Abu Bakr ibn Umar made a division of the power he had established, handing over the more-settled parts to his cousin [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] as [[viceroy]], and also assigning to him his favourite wife Zaynab. Ibn Umar kept the task of suppressing the revolts that had broken out in the desert. When he returned to resume control, he found his cousin too powerful to be superseded.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=717}} In November 1087, < ref name=ZAR89 > [[#Rawd|Ibn Abi Zar, p. 89]]. < /ref >  Abu Bakr was killed in battle \u2013 according to oral tradition by an arrow < ref > P.

In 1062 he founded the city of [[Marrakech]]. In 1080, he conquered the kingdom of [[Tlemcen]] (in modern-day [[Algeria]]) and founded the present city of that name, his rule extending as far east as [[Oran]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=717}} \n \n ====Ghana Empire and the southern wing==== \n According to Arab tradition, the Almoravids conquered the [[Ghana Empire]] sometime around 1076 CE. < ref > Robinson, David. ''Muslim Societies in African History'' (New approaches to African History) < /ref >  An example of this tradition is the record of historian [[Ibn Khaldun]], who cited Shaykh Uthman, the [[Faq\u012bh|faqih]] of Ghana, writing in 1394. According to this source, the Almoravids weakened Ghana and collected tribute from the Sudan, to the extent that the authority of the rulers of Ghana dwindled away, and they were subjugated and absorbed by the [[Sosso Empire|Susu]], a neighboring people of the Sudan. < ref > Ibn Khaldun in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and transl. ''Corpus'', p. 333. < /ref >  Traditions in Mali related that the Soso attacked and took over Mali as well, and the ruler of the Soso, Sumaouro Kant\u00e9, took over the land. < ref > Nehemia Levtzion, ''Ancient Ghana and Mali'' (New York, 1973), pp. 51\u20132; 58\u201360. < /ref > \n \n However criticism from Conrad and Fisher (1982) argued that the notion of any Almoravid military conquest at its core is merely perpetuated folklore, derived from a misinterpretation or naive reliance on Arabic sources.{{sfn|Masonen|Fisher|1996}} According to Professor Timothy Insoll, the archaeology of ancient Ghana simply does not show the signs of rapid change and destruction that would be associated with any Almoravid-era military conquests.{{sfn|Insoll|2003|p=230}} \n \n Dierke Lange agreed with the original military incursion theory but argues that this doesn't preclude Almoravid political agitation, claiming that the main factor of the demise of the Ghana Empire owed much to the latter.{{sfn|Lange|1996|pp=122\u201359}} According to Lange, Almoravid religious influence was gradual, rather than the result of military action; there the Almoravids gained power by marrying among the nation's nobility. Lange attributes the decline of ancient Ghana to numerous unrelated factors, one of which is likely attributable to internal dynastic struggles instigated by Almoravid influence and Islamic pressures, but devoid of military conquest. < ref > {{cite journal|last=Lange|first= Dierk|date=1996|title=The Almoravid expansion and the downfall of Ghana|journal= Der Islam|volume= 73|number= 73 |doi= 10.1515/islm.1996.73.2.313|s2cid= 162370098|pages= 122\u2013159}}. < /ref > \n \n This interpretation of events has been disputed by later scholars like Sheryl L. Burkhalter (1992), who argued that, whatever the nature of the  \" conquest \"  in the south of the Sahara, the influence and success of the Almoravid movement in securing west African gold and circulating it widely necessitated a high degree of political control. < ref > G\u00f3mez-Rivas, Camilo. ''Law and the Islamization of Morocco under the Almoravids'', p. 13. < /ref > \n \n The traditional position says that the ensuing war with the Almoravids pushed Ghana over the edge, ending the kingdom's position as a commercial and military power by 1100. It collapsed into tribal groups and chieftaincies, some of which later assimilated into the Almoravids while others founded the [[Mali Empire]]. \n \n The Arab geographer [[Al-Zuhri]] wrote that the Almoravids ended [[Ibadi]]sm in Tadmekka in 1084 and that Abu Bakr  \" arrived at the mountain of gold \"  in the deep south. \n After the death of Abu Bakr (1087), the confederation of Berber tribes in the Sahara was divided between the descendants of Abu Bakr and his brother Yahya, and would have lost control of Ghana. < ref > ''The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 3: From c.1050 to c.1600'' < /ref >  Sheryl Burkhalter suggests that Abu Bakr's son Yahya was the leader of the Almoravid expedition that conquered Ghana in 1076, and that the Almoravids would have survived the loss of Ghana and the defeat in the Maghreb by the Almohads, and would have ruled the Sahara until the end of the 12th century. < ref > Burkhalter, Sheryl L.

In that year, Ibn Tashfin crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] to [[Algeciras]], and defeated Castile at the [[Battle of az-Zallaqah]] (Battle of Sagrajas). He was prevented from following up his victory by trouble in [[Africa]], which he chose to settle in person. \n \n He returned to Iberia in 1090, avowedly for the purpose of annexing the ''taifa'' principalities of Iberia. He was supported by most of the Iberian people, who were discontented with the heavy taxation imposed upon them by their spendthrift rulers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=717}} Their religious teachers, as well as others in the east (most notably, [[al-Ghazali]] in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[al-Tartushi]] in Egypt, who was himself an Iberian by birth from [[Tortosa]]), detested the ''taifa'' rulers for their religious indifference. The clerics issued a ''[[fatwa]]'' (a non-binding legal opinion) that Yusuf was of sound morals and had the religious right to dethrone the rulers, whom he saw as heterodox in their faith. By 1094, Yusuf had annexed most of the major ''taifas'', with the exception of the one at [[Saragossa]]. The Almoravids were victorious at the [[Battle of Consuegra]], during which the son of [[El Cid]], Diego Rodr\u00edguez, perished. Alfonso, with some Le\u00f3nese, retreated into the castle of Consuegra, which was besieged for eight days until the Almoravids withdrew to the south. \n \n After friendly correspondence with the caliph at [[Baghdad]], whom he acknowledged as ''Amir al-Mu'minin'' ( \" Commander of the Faithful \" ), Yusuf ibn Tashfin in 1097 assumed the title of ''Amir al Muslimin'' ( \" Commander of the Muslims \" ). He died in 1106, when he was reputed to have reached the age of 100. The Almoravid power was at its height at Yusuf's death: the Moorish empire then included all of Northwest Africa as far eastward as [[Algiers]], and all of Iberia south of the [[Tagus]] and as far eastward as the mouth of the [[Ebro]], and including the [[Balearic Islands]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=717\u2013718}} \n \n In 1108 Tamim Al Yusuf defeated the [[Kingdom of Castile]] at the [[Battle of Ucl\u00e9s (1108)|Battle of Ucl\u00e9s]].
