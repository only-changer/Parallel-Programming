The [[Climate  &  Development Knowledge Network]] is helping the government gather the information it needs to change the territory's legislation, so that it can integrate renewables into its grid. [[Barbados]] has also made good progress in switching to renewables, but many other [[Small Island Developing States]] are still at the early stages of planning how to integrate renewable energy into their grids.  \" For a small island we're very far ahead, \"  said Beth Barry, Coordinator of the Anguilla Renewable Energy Office.  \" We've got an Energy Policy and a draft Climate Change policy and have been focusing efforts on the question of [[sustainable energy]] supply for several years now. As a result, we have a lot of information we can share with other islands. \" < ref > Fry, Carolyn. 28 June 2012.

Lloyd International Airport]] (prior to 4 July 2010 known as Wallblake Airport). The primary runway at the airport is {{convert|5462|ft|m}} in length and can accommodate moderate-sized aircraft. Services connect to various other Caribbean islands via local charter airlines and others. Although there are no direct scheduled flights to or from continental America or Europe, [[Tradewind Aviation]] and [[Cape Air]] provide scheduled air service to [[Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]]. The airport can handle large [[narrow-body]] jets such as the [[Boeing 727]], [[Boeing 737]] and [[Airbus 220]]. \n \n ===Road=== \n Aside from taxis, there is no public transport on the island. Cars drive on the left. \n \n ===Boat=== \n There are regular ferries from [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]] to Anguilla. It is a 20-minute crossing from [[Marigot, Saint Martin|Marigot]], St. Martin to Blowing Point, Anguilla. Ferries commence service from 7:00 & nbsp;am. There is also a charter service, from [[Blowing Point]], Anguilla to [[Princess Juliana Airport]] to make travel easier. This way of travel is the most common method of transport between Anguilla and St. Martin. \n \n == See also == \n {{portal|Caribbean| < !--CARICOM-- > |United Kingdom| < !--Anguilla-- > }} \n * [[Bibliography of Anguilla]] \n * [[Outline of Anguilla]] \n * [[Index of Anguilla-related articles]] \n \n == References == \n {{Reflist}} \n \n == Further reading == \n * {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Anguilla |volume=2 |ref={{harvid|EB|1878}} |page=46\u201347 }} \n * {{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Anguilla |volume=2 |ref={{harvid|EB|1911}} |page=42\u201343}} \n * {{citation |last=Hakluyt |first=Richard |title=The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques,  &  Discoveries of the English Nation Made by Sea or Over-land to the Remote and Farthest Distant Quarters of the Earth at any time within the compasse of these 1600 Yeeres, ''Vol. & nbsp;IX'' Made to Florida and New Mexico; certeine Voyages made for the discovery of the Gulfe of California, and to the famous city of Mexico, with the Discourses and Letters depending upon the Voyages of this ninth Volume |contribution=The second voyage unto Florida, made and written by Captaine Laudonniere, which fortified and inhabited there two Summers and one whole Winter |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFYMAAAAIAAJ & pg=PA5 |location=Glasgow |year=1904 |publisher=James MacLehose  & & nbsp;Sons }}. \n * {{citation | last=Law | first=Gwillim | title=Administrative Subdivisions of Countries: A Comprehensive World Reference | publisher=McFarland | year=1999 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nXCeCQAAQBAJ & pg=PA29 | isbn=978-0-7864-6097-7 | chapter=Chapter XIV.
