Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was [[Gerard Malanga]]. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at  \" [[The Factory]] \" , Warhol's [[aluminum foil]]-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included [[Freddie Herko]], [[Ondine (actor)|Ondine]], [[Ronald Tavel]], [[Mary Woronov]], [[Billy Name]], and [[Brigid Berlin]] (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations). < ref > Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 67. < /ref > \n \n During the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation  \" [[Warhol Superstar|Superstars]] \" , including [[Nico]], [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[Edie Sedgwick]], [[Viva (actress)|Viva]], [[Isabelle Collin Dufresne|Ultra Violet]], [[Holly Woodlawn]], [[Jackie Curtis]], and [[Candy Darling]]. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some\u2014like Berlin\u2014remained friends with Warhol until his death.

Warhol, who would become famous as the  \" Pope of Pop \" , turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from [[cartoons]] and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as [[Willem de Kooning]]). Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bonwit Teller's window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries [[Jasper Johns]], [[James Rosenquist]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] had also once graced. < ref > Smith, Patrick S (1986).

From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used [[silk-screen]]ing; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations. < ref > Colacello, Bob (1990), p. 28. < /ref > \n \n In 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group-4 race version of the then  \" elite supercar \"  [[BMW M1]] for the fourth installment in the [[BMW Art Car Project]].

The episode depicts the attempted assassination of Warhol by [[Valerie Solanas]] ([[Lena Dunham]]). \n \n In early 1969, Andy Warhol was commissioned by [[Braniff International Airways|Braniff International]] to appear in two television commercials to promote the luxury airline's  \" When You Got It \u2013 Flaunt It \"  campaign. The campaign was created by the advertising agency Lois Holland Calloway, which was led by [[George Lois]], creator of a famed series of [[Esquire Magazine]] covers. The first commercial series involved pairing unlikely people who shared the fact that they both flew Braniff Airways. Warhol was paired with boxing legend [[Sonny Liston]]. The odd commercial worked as did the others that featured unlikely fellow travelers such as painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and baseball legend [[Whitey Ford]]. \n \n Two additional commercials for Braniff were created that featured famous persons entering a Braniff jet and being greeted by a Braniff hostess while espousing their like for flying Braniff. Warhol was also featured in the first of these commercials that were also produced by Lois and were released in the summer of 1969. Lois has incorrectly stated that he was commissioned by Braniff in 1967 for representation during that year, but at that time Madison Avenue advertising doyenne [[Mary Wells Lawrence]], who was married to Braniff's chairman and president [[Harding Lawrence]], was representing the Dallas-based carrier at that time. Lois succeeded Wells Rich Greene Agency on December 1, 1968. The rights to Warhol's films for Braniff and his signed contracts are owned by a private trust and are administered by Braniff Airways Foundation in Dallas, Texas. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Cass |first1=Richard Benjamin |title=Braniff Airways Flying Colors |date=December 14, 2015 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing, Inc. |isbn=978-1-4671-3440-8 |page=74 |edition=1st |url=https://www.arcadiapublishing.com/Products/9781467134408?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIroPGvtz25AIVENvACh0--AgaEAQYAiABEgISDfD_BwE |access-date=September 29, 2019 |archive-date=December 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221151308/https://www.arcadiapublishing.com/Products/9781467134408?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIroPGvtz25AIVENvACh0--AgaEAQYAiABEgISDfD_BwE |url-status=live }} < /ref > \n \n ===Books=== \n A biography of Andy Warhol written by art critic [[Blake Gopnik]] was published in 2020 under the title ''[[Warhol (book)|Warhol]]''. < ref > {{Cite web |title=Andy Warhol, Superstar |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/books/review/warhol-blake-gopnik.html |last=Sante |first=Luc |author-link=Luc Sante |date=May 3, 2020 |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=May 8, 2020 |archive-date=May 7, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200507143030/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/books/review/warhol-blake-gopnik.html |url-status=live }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |title=Warhol by Blake Gopnik review \u2013 sex, religion and overtaking Picasso |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/22/warhol-life-in-art-blake-gopnik |last=Hughes |first=Kathryn |author-link=Kathryn Hughes |date=February 22, 2020 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=May 8, 2020 |archive-date=May 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200526051800/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/22/warhol-life-in-art-blake-gopnik |url-status=live }} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web |title='Warhol' paints the Pop Art icon as the most influential artist of the 20th century |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/warhol-paints-the-pop-art-icon-as-the-most-influential-artist-of-the-20th-century/2020/04/15/664124e8-7db4-11ea-9040-68981f488eed_story.html |last=Alexander |first=Paul |date=April 17, 2020 |website=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=May 8, 2020 |archive-date=May 11, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200511104740/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/warhol-paints-the-pop-art-icon-as-the-most-influential-artist-of-the-20th-century/2020/04/15/664124e8-7db4-11ea-9040-68981f488eed_story.html |url-status=live }} < /ref > \n \n ==Honors== \n In 2002, the [[U.S. Postal Service]] issued an 18-cent stamp commemorating Warhol.
