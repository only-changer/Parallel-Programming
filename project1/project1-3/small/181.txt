They are present in the [[Lower Cambrian]] fossil record along with [[trilobites]] from the [[Redlichiida]], [[Corynexochida]], and [[Ptychopariida]] orders. The last agnostids went [[extinct]] in the Late [[Ordovician]]. \n \n ==Systematics== \n The Agnostida are divided into two suborders & nbsp;\u2014 [[Agnostina]] and [[Eodiscina]] & nbsp;\u2014 which  are then subdivided into a number of [[family (biology)|families]]. As a group, agnostids are isopygous, meaning their [[pygidium]] is similar in size and shape to their [[cephalon (arthropod anatomy)|cephalon]]. Most agnostid species were eyeless. \n \n The systematic position of the order Agnostida within the class Trilobita remains uncertain, and there has been continuing debate whether they are trilobites or a [[stem group]]. The challenge to the status has focused on Agnostina partly due to the  [[juvenile (organism)|juveniles]] of one genus have been found with legs differing dramatically  from those of adult trilobites, < ref > M\u00fcller, K. J.  &  Walossek, D. (1987):  \" Morphology, ontogeny, and life habit of ''Agnostus pisiformis'' from the Upper Cambrian of Sweden \" . ''Fossils and Strata'', '''19''', 1-124. < /ref >  suggesting they are not members of the [[lamellipedia]]n [[clade]], of which trilobites are a part. Instead, the limbs of agnostids closely resemble those of stem group crustaceans, although they lack the [[proximal endite]], which defines that group. They are likely the [[sister taxon]] to the crustacean stem lineage, and, as such, part of the clade,  [[Crustaceomorpha]]. < ref > Bergstr\u00f6m, J.  &  Hou, X.G. (2005).  \" Early Palaeozoic non-lamellipedian arthropods \" . In S. Koenemann  &  A. J. Ronald (eds.), ''Crustacea and Arthropod Relationships'' (Volume , pp. 75-93). Taylor and Francis Group. < /ref >  Other researchers have suggested, based on a [[cladistic]] analyses of [[dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] [[exoskeleton|exoskeletal]] features, that Eodiscina and Agnostida are closely united, and the Eodiscina descended from the trilobite order [[Ptychopariida]]. < ref > Cotton, T. J.  &  [[Fortey, R.A.]] (2005).  \" Comparative morphology and relationships of the Agnostida \" . In S. Koenemann  &  R. A. Jenner (eds.), ''Crustacea and Arthropod Relationships'' (Volume , pp. 95-136). Taylor and Francis Group. < /ref > \n \n ==Ecology== \n Scientists have long debated whether the agnostids lived a [[pelagic]] or a [[benthic]] lifestyle. Their lack of eyes, a morphology not well-suited for swimming, and their fossils found in association with other benthic trilobites suggest a benthic (bottom-dwelling) mode of life. They are likely to have lived on areas of the ocean floor which received little or no light and fed on [[detritus]] which descended from upper layers of the sea to the bottom. Their wide geographic dispersion in the [[fossil record]] is uncharacteristic of benthic animals, suggesting a pelagic existence. The thoracic segment appears to form a hinge between the head and pygidium allowing for a bivalved [[ostracod]]an-type lifestyle. The orientation of the thoracic appendages appears ill-suited for benthic living. Recent work suggests that some agnostids were benthic predators, engaging in cannibalism and possibly pack-hunting behavior. < ref > McMenamin, M. A. S.
