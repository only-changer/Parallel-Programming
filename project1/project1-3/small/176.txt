Generally considered the most important king in the [[history of Sparta]], Agesilaus was the main actor during the period of [[Spartan hegemony]] that followed the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404 BC). Although brave in combat, Agesilaus lacked the diplomatic skills to preserve Sparta's position, especially against the rising power of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], which reduced Sparta to a secondary power after its victory at [[Battle of Leuctra|Leuctra]] in 371 BC. \n \n Despite the traditional secrecy fostered by the Spartiates, the reign of Agesilaus is particularly well-known thanks to the works of his friend [[Xenophon]], who wrote a large history of Greece (the ''[[Hellenica]]'') covering the years 411 to 362 BC, therefore extensively dealing with Agesilaus' rule. Xenophon furthermore composed a [[Agesilaus (Xenophon)|panegyric biography]] of his friend, perhaps to clean his memory from the criticisms voiced against him. Another historical tradition\u2014much more hostile to Agesilaus than Xenophon's writings\u2014has been preserved in the ''[[Hellenica Oxyrhynchia]]'', and later continued by [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus of Sicily]]. Moreover, [[Plutarch]] wrote a biography of Agesilaus in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', which contains many elements deliberately omitted by Xenophon. \n \n ==Early life== \n \n ===Youth=== \n Agesilaus' father was King [[Archidamus II|Archidamos II]] (r. 469\u2013427), who belonged to the [[List of kings of Sparta|Eurypontid]] dynasty, one of the two royal families of Sparta. Archidamos already had a son from a first marriage with Lampito (his own step-aunt) named [[Agis II|Agis]]. < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', pp. 12, 13. < /ref >  After the death of Lampito, Archidamos remarried in the early 440s with Eupolia, daughter of Melesippidas, whose name indicates an aristocratic status. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', pp. 21, 22. Lampito was probably 40 years younger than Archidamos. < /ref >  Agesilaus was probably born a few years later, in 445 or more likely in 444. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 21. < /ref >  Agesilaus also had a sister named [[Cynisca|Kyniska]] (the first woman in ancient history to achieve an [[ancient Olympic Games|Olympic victory]]). < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 145, is unsure whether Kyniska was Agesilaos' full sister. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 13. < /ref >  The name Agesilaus was rare and harks back to [[Agesilaus I]], one of the earliest kings of Sparta. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', pp. 22, 23. < /ref > \n \n Agesilaus was born lame, a fact that should have cost him his life, since in Sparta deformed babies were thrown into a chasm. < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 14. < /ref >  As he was not heir-apparent, he might have received some leniency from the tribal elders who examined male infants, < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 14. < /ref >  or perhaps that the first effects of the demographic decline of Sparta were already felt at the time, and only the most severely impaired babies were killed. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 22. < /ref > \n \n At the age of 7, Agesilaus had to go through the rigorous education system of Sparta, called the ''[[agoge]]''. < ref name= \" ReferenceA \" > [[Xenophon]], ''Hell.'' iii. 3, to the end, ''Agesilaus'' < /ref > < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 23. < /ref >  Despite his disability, he brilliantly completed the training, < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 14. < /ref >  which massively enhanced his prestige, especially after he became king. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', pp. 24-27. < /ref >  Indeed, as heirs-apparent were exempted of the ''agoge'', very few Spartan kings had gone through the same training as the citizens; another notable exception was [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]], the embodiment of the  \" hero-king \" . < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 24. < /ref >   Between 433 and 428, Agesilaus also became the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|younger lover]] of [[Lysander]], an aristocrat from the circle of Archidamos, whose family had some influence in Libya. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', pp. 28, 29. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 19. < /ref > \n \n === Spartan prince === \n Little is known of Agesilaus' adult life before his reign, principally because [[Xenophon]]\u2014his friend and main biographer\u2014only wrote about his reign. < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 10. < /ref >  Due to his special status, Agesilaus likely became a member of the [[Crypteia|Krypteia]], an elite corps of young Spartans going undercover in Spartan territory to kill some [[helots]] deemed dangerous. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', pp. 30\u201332. < /ref >  Once he turned 20 and became a full citizen, Agesilaus was elected to a [[Syssitia|common mess]], presumably that of his elder half-brother Agis II, who had become king in 427, of which Lysander was perhaps a member. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', pp. 32, 33. < /ref > \n \n Agesilaus probably served during the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013428) against [[Athens]], likely at the [[Battle of Mantinea (418 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]] in 418. < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 21. < /ref >  Agesilaus married Kleora at some point between 408 and 400. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 147. < /ref >  Despite the influence she apparently had on her husband, she is mostly unknown. Her father was Aristomenidas, an influential noble with connections in [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', pp. 146, 147. < /ref >   \n \n Thanks to three treaties signed with [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] in 412\u2013411, Sparta received funding from the Persians, which it used to build a fleet that ultimately defeated Athens. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', pp. 186\u2013189. < /ref >  This fleet was essentially led by Lysander, whose success gave him an enormous influence in the Greek cities of Asia as well as in Sparta, where he even schemed to become king. < ref > Hamilton, ''Sparta's Bitter Victories'', pp. 27, 76, 88\u201398. < /ref > < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', pp. 94\u201399. < /ref >  In 403 the two kings, Agis and [[Pausanias of Sparta|Pausanias]], acted together to relieve him from his command. < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 23\u201325. < /ref > \n \n ==Reign== \n \n === Accession to the throne (400\u2013398 BC) === \n Agis II died while returning from [[Delphi]] between 400 and 398. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 110, supports the date of 400. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. xvii, favours 398. < /ref >  After his funeral, Agesilaus contested the claim of [[Leotychidas]], the son of Agis II, using the widespread belief in Sparta that Leotychidas was an illegitimate son of [[Alcibiades]]\u2014a famous Athenian statesman and nephew of [[Pericles]], who had gone into exile in Sparta during the Peloponnesian War, and then seduced the queen. The rumours were strengthened by the fact that even Agis only recognised Leotychidas as his son on his deathbed. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 110. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 26. < /ref > \n \n Diopeithes, a supporter of Leotychidas, however quoted an old oracle telling that a Spartan king could not be lame, thus refuting Agesilaus' claim, but Lysander cunningly returned the objection by saying that the oracle had to be understood figuratively. The lameness warned against by the oracle would therefore refer to the doubt on Leotychidas' paternity, and this reasoning won the argument. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', pp. 110\u2013113. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', pp. 26, 27. < /ref >  The role of Lysander in the accession of Agesilaus has been debated among historians, principally because [[Plutarch]] makes him the main instigator of the plot, while Xenophon downplays Lysander's influence. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 112, gives more credence to Plutarch. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 28, favours Plutarch's version. < /ref >  Lysander doubtless supported Agesilaus' accession because he hoped that the new king would in return help him to regain the importance that he lost in 403. < ref > Cartledge, ''Sparta and Lakonia'', p. 233. < /ref > \n \n === Conspiracy of Cinadon (399 BC) === \n The [[Conspiracy of Cinadon]] took place during the first year of Agesilaus' reign, in the summer of 399. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 164. < /ref >  Cinadon was a ''hypomeion'', a Spartan who had lost his citizen status, presumably because he could not afford the price of the collective mess\u2014one of the main reasons for the dwindling number of Spartan citizens in the [[Classical antiquity|Classical Era]], called [[Oliganthropia|''oliganthropia'']]. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 165. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 70. < /ref > < ref > Gish,  \" Spartan Justice \" , pp. 353, 354. < /ref >  It is probable that the vast influx of wealth coming to the city after its victory against Athens in 404 triggered inflation in Sparta, which impoverished many citizens with a fixed income, like Cinadon, and caused their downgrade. < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 83. < /ref >  Therefore, the purpose of the plot was likely to restore the status of these disfranchised citizens. < ref > Gish,  \" Spartan Justice \" , p. 356. < /ref >  However, the plot was uncovered and Cinadon and its leaders executed\u2014probably with the active participation of Agesilaus, < ref > Cartledge, ''Sparta and Lakonia'', p. 235. < /ref >  but no further action was taken to solve the social crisis at the origin of the conspiracy. The failure of Agesilaus to acknowledge the critical problem suffered by Sparta at the time has been criticised by modern historians. < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', pp. 84, 85. < /ref > < ref > Gish,  \" Spartan Justice \" , p. 357 (note 40). < /ref > \n \n === Invasion of Asia Minor (396\u2013394 BC) === \n According to the treaties signed in 412 and 411 between Sparta and the Persian Empire, the latter became the overlord of the Greek city-states of [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]]. < ref name= \" :1 \" > Hamilton, ''Sparta's Bitter Victories'', p. 27. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 87. < /ref >  In 401, these cities and Sparta supported the bid of [[Cyrus the Younger|Cyrus the Younger]] (the Persian Emperor's younger son and a good friend of Lysander) against his elder brother, the new emperor [[Artaxerxes II]], who nevertheless defeated Cyrus at [[Battle of Cunaxa|Cunaxa]]. < ref > Hamilton, ''Sparta's Bitter Victories'', pp. 104\u2013107. < /ref >  As a result, Sparta remained at war with Artaxerxes, and supported the Greek cities of Asia, which fought against [[Tissaphernes]], the [[satrap]] of [[Lydia]] and [[Caria]]. < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 88. < /ref >  In 397 Lysander engineered a large expedition in Asia headed by Agesilaus, likely to recover the influence he had over the Asian cities at the end of the Peloponnesian War. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 191. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', pp. 90, 91. Lysander had placed partisans in the cities taken from the Athenian Empire, but was forced to abandon them in order to respect the treaties with Persia, which were enforced in 404. < /ref >  In order to win the approval of the Spartan assembly, Lysander built an army with only 30 Spartan citizens, so the risk would be limited; the bulk of the army consisted of 2,000 [[neodamodes|''neodamodes'']] (freed [[helots]]) and 6,000 Greek allies. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 213. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', pp. 92, 93. < /ref >  In addition, Agesilaus obtained the support of the oracles of [[Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]]. < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 93. < /ref > \n \n ==== The sacrifice at Aulis (396 BC) ==== \n Lysander and Agesilaus had intended the expedition to be a Panhellenic enterprise, < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 192. < /ref >  but Athens, [[Corinth]], and especially Thebes, refused to participate. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 212. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 94. < /ref >  In Spring 396, Agesilaus came to [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] (in [[Boeotia|Boeotian]] territory) to sacrifice on the place where [[Agamemnon]] had done so just before his departure to [[Troy]] at the head of the Greek army in the ''[[Iliad]]'', thus giving a grandiose aspect to the expedition. However he did not inform the Boeotians and brought his own seer to perform the sacrifice, instead of the local one. Learning this, the Boeotians prevented him from sacrificing and further humiliating him by casting away the victim; they perhaps intended to provoke a confrontation, as the relations between Sparta and Thebes had become execrable. Agesilaus then left to Asia, but remained hateful of Thebes for the rest of his life. < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 95. < /ref > [[File:CUH Agesilaus and Pharnabazus.jpg|thumb|Meeting between Spartan king Agesilaus (left) and [[Pharnabazus II]] (right) in 395 BC, when Agesilaus agreed to remove himself from Hellespontine Phrygia.]] \n ==== Campaign in Asia (396\u2013394 BC) ==== \n Once Agesilaus landed in [[Ephesus]], the Spartan main base, he concluded a three months' truce with Tissaphernes, likely to settle the affairs among the Greek allies. < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', pp. 32, 33. < /ref >  He integrated in his army some of the Greek mercenaries formerly hired by Cyrus the Younger (the [[Ten Thousand]]), who had returned from Persia under the leadership of Xenophon, who also remained in Agesilaus' staff. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 59. < /ref >  In Ephesus, Agesilaus' authority was nevertheless overshadowed by Lysander, who met again with many of his supporters that he had placed in control of the Greek cities at the end of the Peloponnesian War. Angered by his local aura, Agesilaus humiliated Lysander several times to force him to leave the army, despite his former relationship and Lysander's role in his accession to the throne. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 213, Lysander was sent away in a diplomatic mission. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', pp. 32\u201337. < /ref >  Plutarch adds that after Agesilaus' emancipation from him, Lysander returned to his undercover scheme to make the monarchy elective. < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 36. < /ref > \n After Lysander's departure, Agesilaus raided [[Phrygia]], the satrapy of [[Pharnabazus II|Pharnabazus]], until his advance guard was defeated not far from [[Dascylium|Daskyleion]] by the superior Persian cavalry. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', pp. 213, 214. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', pp. 96, 97. < /ref >  He then wintered at Ephesus, where he trained a cavalry force, perhaps on the advice of Xenophon, who had commanded the cavalry of the Ten Thousand. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 214. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 97. < /ref >  In 395, the Spartan king managed to trick Tissaphernes into thinking that he would attack [[Caria]], in the south of Asia Minor, forcing the satrap to hold a defence line on the [[B\u00fcy\u00fck Menderes River|Meander river]]. Instead, Agesilaus moved north to the important city of [[Sardis]]. Tissaphernes hastened to meet the king there, but his cavalry sent in advance was defeated by Agesilaus' army. < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', pp. 215, 216. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', pp. 97\u201399. < /ref >  After his victory at the [[Battle of Sardis (395 BC)|Battle of Sardis]], Agesilaus became the first king to be given the command of both land and sea. < ref name= \" :2 \" > Cartledge, ''Sparta and Lakonia'', p. 237. < /ref >  He delegated the naval command to his brother-in-law [[Peisander (general)|Peisander]], whom he appointed [[navarch]] despite his inexperience; perhaps Agesilaus wanted to avoid the rise of a new Lysander, who owed his prominence to his time as navarch. After his defeat, Tissaphernes was executed and replaced as satrap by [[Tithraustes]], who gave Agesilaus 30 talents to move north to the satrapy of Pharnabazus (Persian satraps were often bitter rivals). < ref > Hamilton, ''Sparta's Bitter Victories'', p. 101. < /ref > < ref > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', pp. 216, 217. < /ref > < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 100. < /ref >  Augesilaus' Phrygian campaign of 394 was fruitless, as he lacked the siegeworks required to take the fortresses of Leonton Kephalai, [[Gordion]], and Miletou Teichos. < ref name= \" :0 \" > Cartledge, ''Agesilaos'', p. 217. < /ref > [[File:PERSIA, Achaemenid Empire. temp.

In fact, it is very unlikely that Agesilaus had such grand campaign in mind, and he was soon forced to return to Europe in 394 anyway. < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 100\u2013103. < /ref > \n \n === Corinthian War (395\u2013387 BC) === \n Although Thebes and Corinth had been allies of Sparta throughout the Peloponnesian War, they were dissatisfied by the settlement of the war in 404, with Sparta as [[Spartan hegemony|leader of the Greek world]]. Sparta's imperialist expansion in the Aegean greatly upset its former allies, notably by establishing friendly regimes and garrisons in smaller cities. < ref > Hamilton, ''Sparta's Bitter Victories'', pp. 41\u201348, 54 (note 117), 65. < /ref > < ref > Robin Seager,  \" The Corinthian War \" , in Lewis et al., ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol.

Thebes wanted to avoid being seen as having broken the peace. < /ref >  Lysander and the other king [[Pausanias of Sparta|Pausanias]] entered Boeotia, which enabled the Thebans to bring Athens in the war. Lysander then besieged [[Haliartus]] without waiting for Pausanias and was killed in a [[Battle of Haliartus|Boeotian counter-attack]]. In Sparta, Pausanias was condemned to death by Lysander's friends and went into exile. < ref name= \" ReferenceA \"  / > < ref > Robin Seager,  \" The Corinthian War \" , in Lewis et al., ''Cambridge Ancient History'', vol.

In [[Thessaly]] he won a cavalry battle near [[Narthacium]] against the [[Farsala|Pharsalians]] who had made an alliance with Thebes. < ref > Stamatopoulou,  \" Thessalians Abroad \" , p. 221. < /ref > < ref > Richard Bouchon and Bruno Helly,  \" The Thessalian League \" , in Beck (ed.), ''Federalism'', p. 236. < /ref > < ref > Fran\u00e7oise Ruz\u00e9,  \" The Empire of the Spartans (404\u2013371) \" , p. 333. < /ref >  He then entered [[Boeotia|Boiotia]] by the [[Thermopylae]], where he received reinforcements from Sparta. < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', p. 105. < /ref >  Meanwhile, [[Aristodamos]]\u2014the regent of the young Agiad king [[Agesipolis I|Agesipolis]]\u2014won a [[Battle of Nemea|large victory]] at [[Nemea]] near Argos, which was offset by the disaster of the Spartan navy at [[Battle of Cnidus|Knidos]] against the Persian fleet led by [[Conon|Konon]], an exiled Athenian general. Agesilaus lied to his men about the outcome of the battle of Knidos to avoid demoralising them as they were about to fight a large engagement against the combined armies of Thebes, Athens, Argos and Corinth.

Perhaps Agesilaus was still recovering from his wounds, or he was deprived of command because of the opposition of Lysander's and Pausanias' friends, who were disappointed by his lack of decisive victory and his appointment of Peisander as navarch before the disaster of Knidos. < ref > Hamilton, ''Agesilaus'', pp. 109, 110. < /ref >  The loss of the Spartan fleet besides allowed Konon to capture the island of [[Kythira|Kythera]], in the south of the Peloponnese, from where he could raid Spartan territory. < ref name= \" :3 \" > Fran\u00e7oise Ruz\u00e9,  \" The Empire of the Spartans (404\u2013371) \" , p. 336. < /ref >  In 392, Sparta sent [[Antalcidas]] to Asia in order to negotiate a general peace with [[Tiribazus]], the satrap of [[Lydia]], while Sparta would recognise Persia's sovereignty over the Asian Greek cities.

In the congress of 371 an altercation is recorded between him and the Theban general [[Epaminondas]], and due to his influence, Thebes was peremptorily excluded from the peace, and orders given for Agesilaus's royal colleague [[Cleombrotus I|Cleombrotus]] to march against Thebes in 371.

Athens and Sparta provided support for the revolting satraps in the [[Revolt of the Satraps]], in particular [[Ariobarzanes of Phrygia|Ariobarzanes]]: Sparta sent a force to Ariobarzanes under an aging Agesilaus, while Athens sent a force under [[Timotheus (general)|Timotheus]], which was however diverted when it became obvious that Ariobarzanes had entered frontal conflict with the Achaemenid king. < ref name= \" PS \" > {{cite book |last1=Souza |first1=Philip de |last2=France |first2=John |title=War and Peace in Ancient and Medieval History |date=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139469487 |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9j7zoDeWTdwC & pg=PA41 |language=en}} < /ref > < ref name= \" JH \" > {{cite book |last1=Heskel |first1=Julia |title=The North Aegean Wars, 371-360 B.C |date=1997 |publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag |isbn=9783515069175 |page=96 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djGmzkjbyGUC & pg=PA96 |language=en}} < /ref >  An Athenian mercenary force under [[Chabrias]] was also sent to the Egyptian Pharao [[Teos of Egypt|Tachos]], who was also fighting against the Achaemenid king. < ref name= \" PS \" / > < ref > {{cite book |last1=Fine |first1=John Van Antwerp |title=The Ancient Greeks: A Critical History |date=1983 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674033146 |page=[https://archive.org/details/ancientgreeks00john/page/585 585] |url=https://archive.org/details/ancientgreeks00john |url-access=registration |language=en}} < /ref >  According to [[Xenophon]], < ref > [[Xenophon]], ''Agesilaus'', ii. 26, 27 < /ref >  Agesilaus, in order to gain money for prosecuting the war, supported the [[satrap]] [[Ariobarzanes of Phrygia]] in his revolt against [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] in 364 ([[Revolt of the Satraps]]). \n \n Again, in 362, Epaminondas almost succeeded in seizing the city of Sparta with a rapid and unexpected march.  The [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]], in which Agesilaus took no part, was followed by a general peace: Sparta, however, stood aloof, hoping even yet to recover her supremacy. \n \n ====Egypt expedition (361 BC)==== \n [[File:Agesilas in Egypt 361 BCE.jpg|thumb|Agesilas (center), with Athenian general [[Chabrias]] (left), in the service of Egyptian king [[Nectanebo I]], Egypt 361 BCE.]] \n In 361, Agesilaus went to [[Egypt]] at the head of a [[mercenary]] force to aid the king [[Nectanebo I]] and his regent [[Teos of Egypt|Teos]] against Persia.  He soon transferred his services to Teos's cousin and rival [[Nectanebo II]], who, in return for his help, gave him a sum of over 200 [[attic talent|talents]].  On his way home Agesilaus died in [[Cyrenaica]], around the age of 84, after a reign of some 41 years.  His body was embalmed in wax, and buried at Sparta. < ref name= \" DGRBM \" / > \n \n He was succeeded by his son [[Archidamus III]]. \n \n ==Legacy== \n Agesilaus was of small stature and unimpressive appearance, and was lame from birth. These facts were used as an argument against his succession, an [[oracle]] having warned Sparta against a  \" lame reign. \"   Most ancient writers considered him a highly successful leader in [[guerrilla warfare]], alert and quick, yet cautious\u2014a man, moreover, whose personal bravery was rarely questioned in his own time.  Of his courage, temperance, and hardiness, many instances are cited, and to these were added the less Spartan qualities of kindliness and tenderness as a father and a friend.  As examples, there is the story of his riding a stick-horse with his children and upon being discovered by a friend desiring that he not mention till he himself were the father of children; and because of the affection of his son [[Archidamus III|Archidamus]]' for [[Cleonymus, son of Sphodrias|Cleonymus]], he saved [[Sphodrias]], Cleonymus' father, from execution for his incursion into the [[Piraeus]], and dishonorable retreat, in 378. < ref name= \" DGRBM \" / >   Modern writers tend to be slightly more critical of Agesilaus' reputation and achievements, reckoning him an excellent soldier, but one who had a poor understanding of sea power and [[siegecraft]]. < ref name= \" OCD \" > {{Citation|last=Cartledge|first=Paul Anthony|title=[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]|year=1996|editor-last=Hornblower|editor-first=Simon|contribution=Agesilaus II|place=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}} < /ref > \n \n As a statesman he won himself both enthusiastic adherents and bitter enemies.  Agesilaus was most successful in the opening and closing periods of his reign: commencing but then surrendering a glorious career in Asia; and in extreme age, maintaining his prostrate country.  Other writers acknowledge his extremely high popularity at home, but suggest his occasionally rigid and arguably irrational political loyalties and convictions contributed greatly to Spartan decline, notably his unremitting hatred of Thebes, which led to Sparta's humiliation at the [[Battle of Leuctra]] and thus the end of Spartan hegemony. < ref name= \" OCD \" / >  Historian J. B. Bury remarks that  \" there is something melancholy about his career: \"  born into a Sparta that was the unquestioned continental power of Hellas, the Sparta which mourned him eighty four years later had suffered a series of military defeats which would have been unthinkable to his forebears, had seen its population severely decline, and had run so short of money that its soldiers were increasingly sent on campaigns fought more for money than for defense or glory. < ref > {{Cite book|title=A history of Greece to the death of Alexander the Great|last=Bury|first=J.

His awareness, thoughtfulness, and wisdom were all traits to be emulated diplomatically, while his bravery and shrewdness in battle epitomized the heroic Greek commander. These historians point towards the unstable oligarchies established by Lysander in the former Athenian Empire and the failures of Spartan leaders (such as Pausanias and Kleombrotos) for the eventual suppression of Spartan power. The ancient historian [[Xenophon]] was a huge admirer and served under Agesilaus during the campaigns into [[Asia Minor]]. < ref name= \" ReferenceA \" / > \n \n [[Plutarch]] includes among Agesilaus' 78 essays and speeches comprising the [[Apophthegmata Laconica|apophthegmata]] Agesilaus' letter to the [[ephor]]s on his recall: \n {{quote|We have reduced most of Asia, driven back the barbarians, made arms abundant in Ionia.
