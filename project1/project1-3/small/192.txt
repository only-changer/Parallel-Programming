On 21 October 1649, Ahmed along with his brothers Mehmed and Suleiman were [[circumcised]]. {{sfn|Sakao\u011flu|2007|p=271}}  \n \n During the reigns of his older brothers, Ahmed was imprisoned in [[Kafes]], and he stayed there almost 43 years. \n [[File:PIC 2004-08-23 09-12 9807.JPG|thumb|262px|''The [[mausoleum]] of Ahmed II'' is located inside the [[t\u00fcrbe]] of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].  < small > ''(In the above picture, his [[tomb]] is seen side by side with [[Suleiman II of the Ottoman Empire|Suleiman II]] and [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]).'' < /small > ]] \n \n ==Reign== \n {{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}} \n During his reign, Sultan Ahmed II devoted most of his attention to the wars against the [[Habsburgs]] and related foreign policy, governmental and economic issues. Of these, the most important were the tax reforms and the introduction of the lifelong tax farm system (''malikane'') (see [[tax farming]]). Following the recovery of Belgrade under his predecessor, [[Suleiman II of the Ottoman Empire|Suleiman II]], the military frontier reached a rough stalemate on the Danube, with the Habsburgs no longer able to advance south of it, and the Ottomans attempting, ultimately unsuccessfully, to regain the initiative north of it. \n \n Among the most important features of Ahmed's reign was his reliance on [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha|K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fczade Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha]]. Following his accession to the throne, Sultan Ahmed II confirmed K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fczade Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha in his office as [[grand vizier]]. In office from 1689, Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha was from the [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family]] of grand viziers, and like most of his K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc predecessors in the same office, was an able administrator and military commander. Like his father K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha (grand vizier 1656\u201361) before him,  Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha ordered the removal and execution of dozens of corrupt state officials of the previous regime and replaced them with men loyal to himself. He overhauled the tax system by adjusting it to the capabilities of the taxpayers affected by the latest wars. He also reformed troop mobilization and increased the pool of conscripts available for the army by drafting tribesmen in the Balkans and Anatolia. In October 1690, Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha recaptured [[Belgrade]], a key fortress that commanded the confluence of the rivers [[Danube]] and [[Sava]]; in Ottoman hands since 1521, the fortress had been conquered by the Habsburgs in 1688. \n \n Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha's victory at Belgrade was a major military achievement that gave the Ottomans hope that the military debacles of the 1680s\u2014which had led to the loss of Hungary and Transylvania, an Ottoman vassal principality ruled by pro-Istanbul Hungarian princes\u2014 could be reversed. However, the Ottoman success proved ephemeral. On 19 August 1691, Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha suffered a devastating defeat at the [[Battle of Slankamen]] at the hands of [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Ludwig Wilhelm von Baden]], the Habsburg commander in chief in Hungary, nicknamed \u201cT\u00fcrkenlouis\u201d (Louis the Turk) for his victories against the Ottomans. In the confrontation, recognized by contemporaries as \u201cthe bloodiest battle of the century,\u201d the Ottomans suffered heavy losses: 20,000 men, including the grand vizier. With him, the sultan lost his most capable military commander and the last member of the K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family, who for the previous half century had been instrumental in strengthening the Ottoman military. \n \n Under Faz\u0131l Mustafa Pasha's successors, the Ottomans suffered further defeats. In June 1692 the Habsburgs conquered V\u00e1rad (Oradea, Romania), the seat of an Ottoman governor ({{lang|tr|beylerbeyi}}) since 1660. In 1694 they attempted to recapture V\u00e1rad, but to no avail. On 12 January 1695, they surrendered the fortress of Gyula, the center of an Ottoman sanjak or subprovince since 1566. With the fall of Gyula, the only territory still in Ottoman hands in Hungary was to the east of the River Tisza and to the south of the river Maros, with its center at Temesv\u00e1r. Three weeks later, on 6 February 1695, Ahmed II died in [[Edirne Palace]]. \n \n ==Family== \n ;Consort \n *[[Rabia Sultan]] (died Eski Palace, Bayezid, Istanbul, 14 January 1712, buried in Suleiman I Mausoleum, [[S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque]]);{{sfn|Ulu\u00e7ay|1980|p=114}} \n \n ;Sons \n *\u015eehzade Ibrahim ([[Edirne Palace]], Edirne, 6 October 1692{{sfn|Mehmed Agha|2012|pp=1466-67, 1483-84, 1580}} \u2013 Topkap\u0131 Palace, Istanbul, 4 May 1714, buried in Mustafa I Mausoleum, [[Hagia Sophia]]), with Rabia Sultan, twin with Selim, became Crown Prince on 22 August 1703; \n *\u015eehzade Selim (Edirne Palace, Edirne, 6 October 1692 \u2013 Edirne Palace, Edirne, 15 May 1693, buried in Sultan Mustafa Mausoleum, Hagia Sophia), with Rabia Sultan, twin with Ibrahim.{{sfn|Mehmed Agha|2012|pp=1466-67, 1483-84, 1580}} \n \n ;Daughter \n *Asiye Sultan{{sfn|Ulu\u00e7ay|1980|p=115}} (Edirne Palace, Edirne, 23 October 1694{{sfn|Mehmed Agha|2012|pp=1466-67, 1483-84, 1580}} \u2013 Eski Palace, Bayezid, Istanbul, 9 December 1695, buried in Suleiman I Mausoleum, [[S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque]]), with Rabia Sultan; \n \n == References == \n {{Reflist}} \n \n ===Works cited=== \n *{{cite journal |last1=Mantran |first1=R. |editor1-last=Bearman |editor1-first=P. |editor2-last=Bianquis |editor2-first=Th. |editor3-last=Bosworth |editor3-first=C.E. |editor4-last=van Donzel |editor4-first=E. |editor5-last=Heinrichs |editor5-first=W.P. |title=A\u1e25mad II |journal=Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition |date=24 April 2012 |doi=10.1163/1573-3912_islam_sim_0389 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_0389}} \n *{{cite book|first1=Silahdar Findiklili |last1=Mehmed Agha|title=ZEYL-\u0130 FEZLEKE (1065-22 Ca.1106 / 1654-7 \u015eubat 1695)|year=2012|pages=1466-67, 1483-84, 1580}} \n *{{cite book |last1=Ulu\u00e7ay |first1=M. \u00c7a\u011fatay |title=Padi\u015fahlar\u0131n kad\u0131nlar\u0131 ve k\u0131zlar\u0131 |date=1980 |publisher=T\u00fcrk Tarih Kurumu Bas\u0131mevi |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Padi%C5%9Fahlar%C4%B1n_kad%C4%B1nlar%C4%B1_ve_k%C4%B1zlar%C4%B1/47agAAAAMAAJ?hl=en & gbpv=0 |access-date=7 October 2020 |language=tr}} \n ==Further reading== \n *{{Cite book|last=Finkel |first=Caroline |title=Osman's Dream: The Story of the Ottoman Empire, 1300-1923 |place=New York |publisher=Basic Books |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-465-02396-7}} \n *Michael Hochendlinger, Austria's Wars of Emergence: War, State and Society in the Habsburg Monarchy, 1683\u20131797 (London: Longman, 2003), 157\u201364. \n \n == External links == \n {{Commonscat-inline}} \n \n {{Wikisource author-inline}} \n \n {{s-start}} \n {{s-hou|[[Ottoman Dynasty|House of Osman]]||25 February 1643||6 February 1695}} \n {{s-reg|}} \n {{s-bef|before=[[Suleiman II of the Ottoman Empire|Suleiman II]]}} \n {{s-ttl|title=[[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan of the Ottoman Empire]]|years=22 June 1691 \u2013 6 February 1695}} \n {{s-aft|after=[[Mustafa II]]}} \n {{s-rel|su}} \n {{s-bef|before=[[Suleiman II of the Ottoman Empire|Suleiman II]]}} \n {{s-ttl|title=[[List of caliphs|Caliph of the Ottoman Caliphate]] < /small > |years=22 June 1691 \u2013 6 February 1695}} \n {{s-aft|after=[[Mustafa II]]}} \n {{s-end}} \n \n {{Sultans of the Ottoman Empire}} \n {{Sons of the Ottoman Sultans}} \n \n {{Authority control}} \n \n [[Category:1643 births]] \n [[Category:1695 deaths]] \n [[Category:Ottoman people of the Great Turkish War]] \n [[Category:17th-century Ottoman sultans]] \n [[Category:Turks of the Ottoman Empire]] \n [[Category:Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]] \n [[Category:Ottoman dynasty]]"
