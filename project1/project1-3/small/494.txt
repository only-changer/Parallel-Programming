The relation of the ampere (C/s) to the coulomb is the same as that of the [[watt]] (J/s) to the [[joule]]. \n \n == History == \n {{main|International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units}} \n The ampere is named for French physicist and mathematician [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] (1775\u20131836), who studied [[electromagnetism]] and laid the foundation of [[electrodynamics]]. In recognition of Amp\u00e8re's contributions to the creation of modern electrical science, an international convention, signed at the 1881 [[International Exposition of Electricity]], established the ampere as a standard unit of electrical measurement for electric current. \n \n The ampere was originally defined as one tenth of the unit of [[electric current]] in the [[centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units]]. That unit, now known as the [[abampere]], was defined as the amount of current that generates a force of two [[dyne]]s per centimetre of length between two wires one centimetre apart. < ref > {{Citation|url=http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020214114359/http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_page.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 February 2002 |title=A short history of the SI units in electricity |publisher=Montclair |last=Kowalski |first=L |journal=The Physics Teacher |year=1986 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=97\u201399 |doi=10.1119/1.2341955 |bibcode=1986PhTea..24...97K }} < /ref >  The size of the unit was chosen so that the units derived from it in the [[MKS system of units|MKSA]] system would be conveniently sized. \n \n The  \" international ampere \"  was an early realization of the ampere, defined as the current that would deposit {{val|0.001118|u=grams}} of silver per second from a [[silver nitrate]] solution. < ref > {{Citation |url=http://www.sizes.com/units/ampHist.htm |title=History of the ampere |publisher=Sizes |date=1 April 2014 |access-date=29 January 2017|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020170913/http://sizes.com/units/ampHist.htm |archive-date=20 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }} < /ref >  Later, more accurate measurements revealed that this current is {{val|0.99985|u=A}}. \n \n Since [[power (physics)|power]] is defined as the product of current and voltage, the ampere can alternatively be expressed in terms of the other units using the relationship {{math|1=''I'' = ''P''/''V''}}, and thus 1 & nbsp;A = 1 & nbsp;W/V. Current can be measured by a [[multimeter]], a device that can measure electrical voltage, current, and resistance. \n \n ===Former definition in the SI=== \n Until 2019, the SI defined the ampere as follows: \n < blockquote > \n The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed one [[metre]] apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to {{val|2|e=-7}} [[newton (unit)|newtons]] per metre of length. < ref name= \" formerSI definition \" > {{SIbrochure8th}} < /ref > {{rp|113}}  < ref > {{Citation | first = Paul MS | last = Monk | title = Physical Chemistry: Understanding our Chemical World | publisher = John Wiley  &  Sons | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-471-49180-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LupAi35QjhoC & q=ampere+definition+si & pg=PA16  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140102235952/http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0471491802 & id=LupAi35QjhoC & pg=PA16 & lpg=PA16 & ots=IMiGyIL-67 & dq=ampere+definition+si & sig=9Y0k0wgvymmLNYFMcXodwJZwvAM | archive-date = 2 January 2014 |url-status=live  }} < /ref > \n < /blockquote > \n \n [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]] < ref name=Serway > {{cite book \n  |first1      = Raymond A \n  |last1       = Serway \n  |last2       = Jewett \n  |first2      = JW \n  |title       = Serway's principles of physics: a calculus based text \n  |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=1DZz341Pp50C & q=wire+%22magnetic+force%22 & pg=RA1-PA746 \n  |publisher   = Thompson Brooks/Cole \n  |edition     = Fourth \n  |location    = Belmont, CA \n  |year        = 2006 \n  |page        = 746 \n  |isbn        = 0-53449143-X \n  |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130621210413/http://books.google.com/books?id=1DZz341Pp50C & pg=RA1-PA746 & dq=wire+%22magnetic+force%22 & lr= & as_brr=0 & sig=4vMV_CH6Nm8ZkgjtDJFlupekYoA#PRA1-PA746,M1 \n  |archive-date = 21 June 2013 \n |url-status=live   \n }} < /ref > < ref name =  \" Beyond \" > {{Citation | url = https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/newsfromnist_beyond_the_kilogram.htm | title = Beyond the Kilogram: Redefining the International System of Units | year = 2006 | publisher = [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] | place = US | access-date = 3 December 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080321221139/https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/newsfromnist_beyond_the_kilogram.htm| archive-date= 21 March 2008  < !--DASHBot-- > |url-status=live  }}. < /ref >  states that there is an attractive or repulsive force between two parallel wires carrying an electric current.
