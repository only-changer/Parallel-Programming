The act authorised the [[Governor of Western Australia]] to make ordinances for the territory. In July 1938 the territory was annexed to the [[Northern Territory]], then also administered by the Commonwealth, whose laws, ordinances and regulations applied to the Northern Territory. When [[self-government]] was granted to the Northern Territory [[Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978|on 1 July 1978]], administration of Ashmore and Cartier Islands was retained by the Commonwealth. < ref name=DIRD/ > < ref name=YrBk1981 > [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=MVc4-noHRpIC & pg=PA2 & lpg=PA2 & dq=Authorities+close+off+Cartier+Island & source=bl & ots=GAWhQNcmeV & sig=Hjw9iTjJA0CN1RASyjxCV9uiGys & hl=en & sa=X & ved=0ahUKEwiXoKH338LNAhXGoJQKHSv5BjYQ6AEIVjAH#v=onepage & q=Authorities%20close%20off%20Cartier%20Island & f=false Year Book Australia, 1981, p.2] < /ref > \n \n In 1983, the territory was declared a nature reserve under the ''National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975'', < ref name=DIRD/ >  now replaced by the ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]''. < ref > ''[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/epabca1999588/ Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]'' < /ref >  Cartier Island, which was a former bombing range, became a marine reserve in 2000. \n \n After the islands became a first point of contact with the [[Australian migration zone]], in September 2001, the Australian government excised the Ashmore and Cartier Islands from the Australian migration zone. < ref name=DIRD/ > \n \n ===Indonesian heritage and memorandum=== \n Ashmore has been regularly visited and fished by Indonesian fishermen since the early eighteenth century. A 1974 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Australia and Indonesia sets out arrangements by which traditional fishers can access resources in Australia's territorial sea in the region.
