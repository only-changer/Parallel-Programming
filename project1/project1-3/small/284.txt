Ruling briefly, he lost the crown to [[Demetrius II Nicator]] during his defeat at the [[Battle of Antioch (145 BC)]] in Syria, dying shortly after. His reign marks the beginning of the disintegration of the Seleucid realm, with important eastern satrapies such as [[Media (region)|Media]] being lost to the nascent [[Parthian Empire]]. \n \n ==Life== \n ===Origins and mission to Rome=== \n Alexander Balas claimed to be the son of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] and [[Laodice IV]] and heir to the Seleucid throne.

He also assumed the title of ''Theopator'' ('Divinely Fathered'), which recalled Antiochus' epithet ''Theos Epiphanes'' ('God Manifest'). The coinage also presented Alexander Balas in the guise of [[Alexander the Great]], with pronounced facial features and long flowing hair.

She is shown with divine attributes (a [[cornucopia]] and a [[Calathus (basket)|calathus]]) and is depicted in front of the king.

Much of [[Coele Syria]] was lost to him immediately, possibly as a result of the succession of the regional commander. Jonathan attacked Demetrius's position from the south, seizing [[Jaffa]] and [[Ashdod]], while Alexander Balas was occupied with a revolt in [[Cilicia]]. < ref > I Maccabees 10.69\u201389; Josephus ''AJ'' 13.88\u2013102 < /ref >  In 145 BC Ptolemy VI of Egypt invaded Syria, ostensibly in support of Alexander Balas.

Alexander now fled to Arabia in order to join up with Zabdiel, but he was killed.
