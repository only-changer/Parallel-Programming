Arsenic occurs in many minerals, usually in combination with [[sulfur]] and [[metal]]s, but also as a pure elemental [[crystal]]. Arsenic is a [[metalloid]]. It has various [[allotropy|allotropes]], but only the gray form, which has a metallic appearance, is important to industry. \n \n The primary use of arsenic is in alloys of [[lead]] (for example, in [[car batteries]] and [[ammunition]]). Arsenic is a common n-type [[dopant]] in [[semiconductor]] electronic devices. It is also a component of the III-V [[compound semiconductor]] [[gallium arsenide]]. Arsenic and its compounds, especially the trioxide, are used in the production of [[pesticide]]s, treated wood products, [[herbicide]]s, and [[insecticide]]s. These applications are declining with the increasing recognition of the toxicity of arsenic and its compounds. < ref name=Ullmann > {{Ullmann|author = Grund, Sabina C. |author2 = Hanusch, Kunibert |author3 = Wolf, Hans Uwe |title = Arsenic and Arsenic Compounds|doi = 10.1002/14356007.a03_113.pub2}} < /ref > \n \n [[#Bacteria|A few species of bacteria]] are able to use arsenic compounds as respiratory [[metabolite]]s.

It is sensitive to mobilization at pH values typical of natural waters (pH 6.5\u20138.5) under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. Arsenic can occur in the environment in several oxidation states (\u22123, 0, +3 and +5), but in natural waters it is mostly found in inorganic forms as oxyanions of trivalent arsenite [As(III)] or pentavalent arsenate [As(V)]. Organic forms of arsenic are produced by biological activity, mostly in surface waters, but are rarely quantitatively important. Organic arsenic compounds may, however, occur where waters are significantly impacted by industrial pollution. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Smedley, P. L.|title=A review of the source, behaviour and distribution of arsenic in natural waters|doi=10.1016/S0883-2927(02)00018-5|journal=Applied Geochemistry|volume =17| issue =5|year=2002|pages =517\u2013568|bibcode=2002ApGC...17..517S|url=http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/12311/1/Abstract.pdf}} < /ref > \n \n Arsenic may be solubilized by various processes. When pH is high, arsenic may be released from surface binding sites that lose their positive charge. When water level drops and [[sulfide]] minerals are exposed to air, arsenic trapped in sulfide minerals can be released into water. When organic carbon is present in water, bacteria are fed by directly reducing As(V) to As(III) or by reducing the element at the binding site, releasing inorganic arsenic. < ref > [https://web.archive.org/web/20110308104034/http://www.civil.umaine.edu/macrae/arsenic_gw.htm How Does Arsenic Get into the Groundwater]. Civil and Environmental Engineering. [[University of Maine]] < /ref > \n \n The aquatic transformations of arsenic are affected by pH, reduction-oxidation potential, organic matter concentration and the concentrations and forms of other elements, especially iron and manganese. The main factors are pH and the redox potential. Generally, the main forms of arsenic under oxic conditions are H < sub > 3 < /sub > AsO < sub > 4 < /sub > , H < sub > 2 < /sub > AsO < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > \u2212 < /sup > , HAsO < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > 2\u2212 < /sup > , and AsO < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > 3\u2212 < /sup >  at pH 2, 2\u20137, 7\u201311 and 11, respectively. Under reducing conditions, H < sub > 3 < /sub > AsO < sub > 4 < /sub >  is predominant at pH 2\u20139. \n \n Oxidation and reduction affects the migration of arsenic in subsurface environments. Arsenite is the most stable soluble form of arsenic in reducing environments and arsenate, which is less mobile than arsenite, is dominant in oxidizing environments at neutral pH. Therefore, arsenic may be more mobile under reducing conditions. The reducing environment is also rich in organic matter which may enhance the solubility of arsenic compounds. As a result, the [[adsorption]] of arsenic is reduced and dissolved arsenic accumulates in groundwater. That is why the arsenic content is higher in reducing environments than in oxidizing environments. < ref > Zeng Zhaohua, Zhang Zhiliang (2002).  \" The formation of As element in groundwater and the controlling factor \" . Shanghai Geology 87 (3): 11\u201315. < /ref > \n \n The presence of sulfur is another factor that affects the transformation of arsenic in natural water. Arsenic can [[precipitate]] when metal sulfides form. In this way, arsenic is removed from the water and its mobility decreases. When oxygen is present, bacteria oxidize reduced sulfur to generate energy, potentially releasing bound arsenic. \n \n Redox reactions involving Fe also appear to be essential factors in the fate of arsenic in aquatic systems. The reduction of iron oxyhydroxides plays a key role in the release of arsenic to water. So arsenic can be enriched in water with elevated Fe concentrations. < ref > {{cite journal|title=Redox control of arsenic mobilization in Bangladesh groundwater|doi=10.1016/j.apgeochem.2003.09.007 |volume=19 |issue=2 |journal=Applied Geochemistry|pages=201\u2013214|bibcode=2004ApGC...19..201Z|year=2004 |last1=Zheng |first1=Y |last2=Stute |first2=M |last3=Van Geen |first3=A |last4=Gavrieli |first4=I |last5=Dhar |first5=R |last6=Simpson |first6=H.J |last7=Schlosser |first7=P |last8=Ahmed |first8=K.M }} < /ref >  Under oxidizing conditions, arsenic can be mobilized from [[pyrite]] or iron oxides especially at elevated pH. Under reducing conditions, arsenic can be mobilized by reductive desorption or dissolution when associated with iron oxides. The reductive desorption occurs under two circumstances. One is when arsenate is reduced to arsenite which adsorbs to iron oxides less strongly. The other results from a change in the charge on the mineral surface which leads to the desorption of bound arsenic. < ref > Thomas, Mary Ann (2007).

Dissimilatory arsenate-respiring prokaryotes (DARP) speed up the reduction of As(V) to As(III). DARP use As(V) as the electron acceptor of anaerobic respiration and obtain energy to survive. Other organic and inorganic substances can be oxidized in this process. [[Chemoautotrophic]] arsenite oxidizers (CAO) and [[heterotrophic]] arsenite oxidizers (HAO) convert As(III) into As(V). CAO combine the oxidation of As(III) with the reduction of oxygen or nitrate. They use obtained energy to fix produce organic carbon from CO < sub > 2 < /sub > . HAO cannot obtain energy from As(III) oxidation.

In polluted areas, uptake of the more toxic arsenite ion (found more particularly in reducing conditions) is likely in poorly-drained soils. \n \n === Toxicity in animals === \n {| class= \" wikitable \" \n !Compound \n !Animal \n !LD < sub > 50 < /sub > \n !Route \n |- \n |Arsenic \n |Rat \n |763 & nbsp;mg/kg \n |oral \n |- \n |Arsenic \n |Mouse \n |145 & nbsp;mg/kg \n |oral \n |- \n |[[Calcium arsenate]] \n |Rat \n |20 & nbsp;mg/kg \n |oral \n |- \n |Calcium arsenate \n |Mouse \n |794 & nbsp;mg/kg \n |oral \n |- \n |Calcium arsenate \n |Rabbit \n |50 & nbsp;mg/kg \n |oral \n |- \n |Calcium arsenate \n |Dog \n |38 & nbsp;mg/kg \n |oral \n |- \n |[[Lead arsenate]] \n |Rabbit \n |75 & nbsp;mg/kg \n |oral \n |} \n \n {| class= \" wikitable \" \n !Compound \n !Animal \n !LD < sub > 50 < /sub > < ref name=Hughes/ > \n !Route \n |- \n |Arsenic trioxide (As(III)) \n |Mouse \n |26 & nbsp;mg/kg \n |oral \n |- \n |Arsenite (As(III)) \n |Mouse \n |8 & nbsp;mg/kg \n |im \n |- \n |Arsenate (As(V)) \n |Mouse \n |21 & nbsp;mg/kg \n |im \n |- \n |MMA (As(III)) \n |Hamster \n |2 & nbsp;mg/kg \n |ip \n |- \n |MMA (As(V)) \n |Mouse \n |916 & nbsp;mg/kg \n |oral \n |- \n |DMA (As(V)) \n |Mouse \n |648 & nbsp;mg/kg \n |oral \n |- \n | colspan= \" 4 \"  |im = injected intramuscularly \n ip = administered intraperitoneally \n |} \n \n === Biological mechanism === \n \n Arsenic's toxicity comes from the affinity of arsenic(III) oxides for [[thiol]]s. Thiols, in the form of [[cysteine]] residues and [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] such as [[lipoic acid]] and [[coenzyme A]], are situated at the active sites of many important [[enzyme]]s. < ref name=Ullmann / > \n \n Arsenic disrupts [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production through several mechanisms. At the level of the [[citric acid cycle]], arsenic inhibits [[lipoic acid]], which is a cofactor for [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]]. By competing with phosphate, arsenate uncouples [[oxidative phosphorylation]], thus inhibiting energy-linked reduction of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD+]], mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Hydrogen peroxide production is also increased, which, it is speculated, has potential to form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. These metabolic interferences lead to death from multi-system [[organ failure]]. The organ failure is presumed to be from [[necrotic]] cell death, not [[apoptosis]], since energy reserves have been too depleted for apoptosis to occur. < ref name=Hughes > {{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S0378-4274(02)00084-X |title = Arsenic toxicity and potential mechanisms of action |date = 2002 |last1 = Hughes |first1 = Michael F. |journal = Toxicology Letters |volume = 133 |pages = 1\u201316 |pmid = 12076506 |issue = 1| url = https://zenodo.org/record/1260065 }} < /ref > \n < !--A [[post mortem]] in an arsenic poisoning death reveals brick-red-colored [[mucosa]], owing to severe [[hemorrhage]]. copyright violation from http://rfppl.com/subscription/upload_pdf/Art%204_415.pdf if we need it there is another ref 10.1080/10643389991259227 -- > \n \n === Exposure risks and remediation === \n \n Occupational exposure and [[arsenic poisoning]] may occur in persons working in industries involving the use of inorganic arsenic and its compounds, such as wood preservation, glass production, nonferrous metal alloys, and electronic semiconductor manufacturing.
