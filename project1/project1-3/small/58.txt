Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration, hard stool, or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication.  This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area, and then develops into an abscess.  This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the [[anus]] which grows larger and more painful with time.  Like other abscesses, perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment, such as an incision and [[debridement]] or [[Lancing (surgical procedure)|lancing]]. \n \n {{Anchor|Incisional abscess}} \n \n ===Incisional abscess=== \n An ''incisional abscess'' is one that develops as a complication secondary to a [[surgical incision]].

The cytokines trigger an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]], which draws large numbers of [[white blood cell]]s to the area and increases the regional blood flow. \n \n The final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall, or capsule, that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures. However, such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus, or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object. \n < gallery mode= \" packed \"  heights= \" 180 \" > \n File:Blausen 0007 Abscess.png|A diagram of an abscess. \n file:Pyemic abscesses of kidney.jpg|[[Pyaemia|Pyemic]] abscesses of a [[kidney]]. \n < /gallery > \n \n ==Diagnosis== \n [[File:UOTW 66 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|thumb|Ultrasound showing an abscess of the skin < ref > {{cite web|title=UOTW #66 \u2013 Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-66/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|access-date=27 May 2017|date=7 January 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102223449/http://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-66/|archive-date=2 November 2016}} < /ref > ]] \n \n [[File:Ultrasound image of breast 110323101432 1023060.jpg|Ultrasound image of breast abscess, appearing as a mushroom-shaped dark (hypoechoic) area|thumb]] \n \n An abscess is a localized collection of pus (purulent inflammatory tissue) caused by suppuration buried in a tissue, an organ, or a confined space, lined by the pyogenic membrane. < ref > Robins/8th/68 < /ref >  [[Ultrasound]] imaging in the emergency department can help in a diagnosis. < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Barbic|first1=D|last2=Chenkin|first2=J|last3=Cho|first3=DD|last4=Jelic|first4=T|last5=Scheuermeyer|first5=FX|title=In patients presenting to the emergency department with skin and soft tissue infections what is the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasonography for the diagnosis of abscess compared to the current standard of care?

If foreign objects are not the cause, incising and draining the abscess is standard treatment. < ref name= \" ACEPfive \" / > < ref > {{cite book |title=Surgery: Facts and Figures |last=Green |first=James |author2=Saj Wajed |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn= 1-900151-96-0}} < /ref > \n \n In critical areas where surgery presents a high risk, it may be delayed or used as a last resort.  The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess. \n \n === Antibiotics === \n Most people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics. < ref name= \" ACEPfive \" / >  Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of [[cellulitis]], symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing [[immunosuppression]]. < ref name=NEJM2014/ >  People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics. < ref name=NEJM2014/ >  If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated. < ref name=NEJM2014/ > \n \n In those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective. < ref name=NEJM2014/ >  Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]]. < ref name=NEJM2014/ >  The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment. < ref name= \" ACEPfive \" / >  If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than an abscess, consideration should be given to the possibility of the strep species as a cause, that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin. This would be in the case of patients that are able to tolerate penicillin. [[Antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels. \n \n [[Cell culture|Culturing the wound]] is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage. < ref name= \" ACEPfive \" / >  Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment. < ref name= \" ACEPfive \" / > \n \n ===Packing=== \n In North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, nor bring faster healing, or fewer physician visits. < ref > {{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=KG|title=News, views, and reviews.
