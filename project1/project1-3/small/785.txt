Historically, these terms have been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the [[Sun]] that did not resolve into a disc in a telescope and was not observed to have characteristics of an active [[comet]] such as a [[Comet tail|tail]]. As [[Distant minor planet|minor planets in the outer Solar System]] were discovered that were found to have [[Volatiles|volatile]]-rich surfaces similar to comets, these came to be distinguished from the objects found in the main [[asteroid belt]]. < ref name=JPL-Asteroids/ >  The term  \" asteroid \"  refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System, including those co-orbital with [[Jupiter]]. Larger asteroids are often called '''planetoids'''. \n \n ==Overview== \n Millions of asteroids exist: many are shattered remnants of [[planetesimal]]s, bodies within the young Sun's [[solar nebula]] that never grew large enough to become [[planet]]s. < ref name=CNEOS-FAQ/ >  The vast majority of known asteroids orbit within the main asteroid belt located between the orbits of [[Mars]] and Jupiter, or are co-orbital with Jupiter (the [[Jupiter trojan]]s). However, other orbital families exist with significant populations, including the [[near-Earth object]]s. Individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic [[Emission spectrum|spectra]], with the majority falling into three main groups: [[C-type asteroid|C-type]], [[M-type asteroid|M-type]], and [[S-type asteroid|S-type]]. These were named after and are generally identified with [[Carbon|carbon-rich]], [[metal]]lic, and [[silicate]] (stony) compositions, respectively. The sizes of asteroids varies greatly; the largest, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], is almost {{cvt|1000|sigfig=1|km}} across and massive enough to qualify as a [[dwarf planet]]. \n \n Asteroids are somewhat arbitrarily differentiated from [[comet]]s and [[meteoroid]]s. In the case of comets, the difference is one of composition: while asteroids are mainly composed of mineral and rock, comets are primarily composed of dust and ice. Furthermore, asteroids formed closer to the sun, preventing the development of cometary ice. < ref name=CalTech-what-diff/ >  The difference between asteroids and meteoroids is mainly one of size: meteoroids have a diameter of one meter or less, whereas asteroids have a diameter of greater than one meter. < ref name=Rubin2010/ >  Finally, meteoroids can be composed of either cometary or asteroidal materials. < ref name= \" Universe Today \" / > \n \n Only one asteroid, [[4 Vesta]], which has a relatively [[Albedo|reflective surface]], is normally visible to the naked eye, and this is only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned. Rarely, small asteroids passing close to Earth may be visible to the naked eye for a short time. < ref name=SPACE-2004-02-04/ >  {{As of|2020|3|df=dmy}}, the [[Minor Planet Center]] had data on 930,000 & nbsp;minor planets in the inner and outer Solar System, of which about 545,000 had enough information to be given numbered designations. < ref name=MPCcount/ > \n \n The United Nations declared 30 & nbsp;June as International [[Asteroid Day]] to educate the public about asteroids.

Fifteen years later, he found [[5 Astraea]], the first new asteroid in 38 years. He also found [[6 Hebe]] less than two years later. After this, other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that (except the wartime year 1945).

First, a region of the sky was [[Astrophotography|photographed]] by a wide-field [[telescope]], or [[astrograph]]. Pairs of photographs were taken, typically one hour apart. Multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days. Second, the two films or [[photographic plate|plates]] of the same region were viewed under a [[stereoscope]]. Any body in orbit around the Sun would move slightly between the pair of films. Under the stereoscope, the image of the body would seem to float slightly above the background of stars. Third, once a moving body was identified, its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope. The location would be measured relative to known star locations. < ref > {{cite web |last=Chapman |first=Mary G. |date=17 May 1992 |title=Carolyn Shoemaker, planetary astronomer and most successful 'comet hunter' to date |publisher=USGS |department=Astrogeology |url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/About/People/CarolynShoemaker |access-date=15 April 2008}} < /ref > \n \n These first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery: the observer has only found an apparition, which gets a [[provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]], made up of the year of discovery, a letter representing the half-month of discovery, and finally a letter and a number indicating the discovery's sequential number (example: {{mp|1998 FJ|74}}). \n \n The last step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to the [[Minor Planet Center]], where computer programs determine whether an apparition ties together earlier apparitions into a single orbit. If so, the object receives a catalogue number and the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer, and granted the honor of naming the object subject to the approval of the [[International Astronomical Union]]. \n \n === Computerized methods === \n [[File:Asteroid 2004 FH.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|[[2004 FH]] is the center dot being followed by the sequence; the object that flashes by during the clip is an [[satellite|artificial satellite]].]] \n [[File:Known NEAs.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Cumulative discoveries of just the near-Earth asteroids known by size, 1980\u20132017]] \n There is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross [[Earth]]'s, and that could, given enough time, collide with Earth ''(see [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|Earth-crosser asteroids]])''. The three most important groups of [[near-Earth asteroid]]s are the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollos]], [[Amor asteroid|Amors]], and [[Aten asteroid|Atens]]. Various [[asteroid deflection strategies]] have been proposed, as early as the 1960s. < !--- ''Project Icarus'' --- > \n \n The [[near-Earth object|near-Earth]] asteroid [[433 Eros]] had been discovered as long ago as 1898, and the 1930s brought a flurry of similar objects.

Astronomers began to realize the possibilities of Earth impact. \n \n Two events in later decades increased the alarm: the increasing acceptance of the [[Alvarez hypothesis]] that an [[impact event]] resulted in the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction]], and the 1994 observation of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] crashing into [[Jupiter]].

The main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to [[Outgassing|sublimation]] of near-surface ices by solar radiation. A few objects have ended up being dual-listed because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity. Conversely, some (perhaps all) comets are eventually depleted of their surface [[volatiles|volatile ices]] and become asteroid-like.

Vesta is the parent body of the [[Vestian family]] and other [[V-type asteroid]]s, and is the source of the [[HED meteorite]]s, which constitute 5% of all meteorites on Earth. \n \n Pallas is unusual in that, like [[Uranus]], it rotates on its side, with its axis of rotation tilted at high angles to its orbital plane. < ref name= \" Torppa1996 \" / >  Its composition is similar to that of Ceres: high in carbon and silicon, and perhaps partially differentiated. < ref name=Icarus-1983-v56-p398/ >  Pallas is the parent body of the [[Palladian family]] of asteroids. \n \n Hygiea is the largest carbonaceous asteroid < ref name=Icarus-2002-156-p202/ >  and, unlike the other largest asteroids, lies relatively close to the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. < ref name=OrbitSimltr/ >  It is the largest member and presumed parent body of the [[Hygiean family]] of asteroids.

Observations taken with the [[Very Large Telescope]]'s [[VLT-SPHERE|SPHERE]] imager in 2017 and 2018, and announced in late 2019, revealed that Hygiea has a nearly spherical shape, which is consistent both with it being in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] (and thus a [[dwarf planet]]), or formerly being in hydrostatic equilibrium, or with being disrupted and recoalescing. < ref name=NatAstr-2019-10-28/ > < ref name=Strickland2019/ > \n \n {| class= \" wikitable \" \n |- style= \" background:#ccf; \" \n ! colspan= \" 13 \"  style= \" background:#ddd; \" | Attributes of largest asteroids \n |- style= \" font-size: smaller; \" \n !Name \n !Orbital < br/ > radius < br/ > ([[Astronomical unit|AU]]) \n ![[Orbital period|Orbital < br/ > period]] < br/ > (years) \n ![[Inclination|Inclination < br/ > to ecliptic]] \n ![[Orbital eccentricity|Orbital < br/ > eccentricity]] \n !

Very few asteroids with a diameter larger than 100 meters have a rotation period smaller than 2.2 & nbsp;hours. < ref > {{cite web |title=About Lightcurves |series=Asteroid Lightcurve Photometry Database |website=ALCDEF |date=4 December 2018 |url=http://alcdef.org/ |access-date=27 December 2018}} < /ref >  For asteroids rotating faster than approximately this rate, the inertial force at the surface is greater than the gravitational force, so any loose surface material would be flung out. However, a solid object should be able to rotate much more rapidly. This suggests that most asteroids with a diameter over 100 meters are [[rubble pile]]s formed through the accumulation of debris after collisions between asteroids. < ref name=Rossi-2004/ > \n \n {{further|List of fast rotators (minor planets)|List of slow rotators (minor planets)}} \n \n === Composition === \n [[File:Vesta Cratered terrain with hills and ridges.jpg|thumb|right|Cratered terrain on 4 Vesta]] \n The physical composition of asteroids is varied and in most cases poorly understood. Ceres appears to be composed of a rocky core covered by an icy mantle, where Vesta is thought to have a [[nickel-iron]] core, [[olivine]] mantle, and basaltic crust. < ref name=Hubble-Vespa-1995-04-19/ >  [[10 Hygiea]], however, which appears to have a uniformly primitive composition of [[carbonaceous chondrite]], is thought to be the largest undifferentiated asteroid. Most of the smaller asteroids are thought to be piles of rubble held together loosely by gravity, though the largest are probably solid. Some asteroids have [[Asteroid moon|moons]] or are co-orbiting [[binary asteroid|binaries]]: Rubble piles, moons, binaries, and scattered [[asteroid family|asteroid families]] are thought to be the results of collisions that disrupted a parent asteroid, or, possibly, a [[disrupted planet|planet]]. < ref name= \" ARX-20060816 \" / > \n \n Asteroids contain traces of [[amino acid]]s and other organic compounds, and some speculate that asteroid impacts may have seeded the early Earth with the chemicals necessary to initiate life, or may have even brought life itself to Earth ''(also see [[panspermia]])''. < ref name=SPACE-2001-12-19/ > < ref name=Reuell-2019/ >  In August & nbsp;2011, a report, based on [[NASA]] studies with [[meteorite]]s found on [[Earth]], was published suggesting [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] components ([[adenine]], [[guanine]] and related [[organic molecules]]) may have been formed on asteroids and [[comet]]s in [[outer space]]. < ref name= \" Callahan \" / > < ref name= \" Steigerwald \" / > < ref name= \" DNA \" / > \n [[File:PIA18469-AsteroidCollision-NearStarNGC2547-ID8-2013.jpg|thumb|right|Asteroid collision{{Snd}} building planets (artist concept).]] \n Composition is calculated from three primary sources: [[albedo]], surface spectrum, and density. The last can only be determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have. So far, every asteroid with moons has turned out to be a rubble pile, a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume. The investigated asteroids are as large as 280 & nbsp;km in diameter, and include [[121 Hermione]] (268\u00d7186\u00d7183 & nbsp;km), and [[87 Sylvia]] (384\u00d7262\u00d7232 & nbsp;km). Only half a dozen asteroids are [[List of notable asteroids#Largest by diameter|larger than 87 & nbsp;Sylvia]], though none of them have moons; however, some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive, suggesting they may not have been disrupted, and indeed [[511 Davida]], the same size as Sylvia to within measurement error, is estimated to be two and a half times as massive, though this is highly uncertain. The fact that such large asteroids as Sylvia can be rubble piles, presumably due to disruptive impacts, has important consequences for the formation of the Solar System: Computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging, but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge. This means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly. < ref name=Icarus-2011-02-p1022/ > \n \n On 7 & nbsp;October 2009, the presence of [[ice|water ice]] was confirmed on the surface of [[24 Themis]] using [[NASA]]'s [[Infrared Telescope Facility]]. The surface of the asteroid appears completely covered in ice. As this [[ice]] layer is [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimating]], it may be getting replenished by a reservoir of ice under the surface. Organic compounds were also detected on the surface. < ref name=Cowen-2009/ > < ref name=Atkinson-2009/ > < ref name= \" Campins2010 \" / > < ref name=RivkinEmery2010/ >  Scientists hypothesize that some of the first water brought to [[Earth]] was delivered by asteroid impacts after the collision that produced the [[Moon]].

Of the big four, Pallas and Hygiea are practically unknown. Vesta has compression fractures encircling a radius-size crater at its south pole but is otherwise a [[spheroid]]. Ceres seems quite different in the glimpses Hubble has provided, with surface features that are unlikely to be due to simple craters and impact basins, but details will be expanded with the ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn spacecraft]]'', which entered Ceres orbit on 6 & nbsp;March 2015. < ref name=Boyle2015Mar06/ > \n \n === Color === \n Asteroids become darker and redder with age due to [[space weathering]]. < ref name=UHi2005-05-19/ >  However evidence suggests most of the color change occurs rapidly, in the first hundred thousand years, limiting the usefulness of spectral measurement for determining the age of asteroids. < ref name=Courtland-2009/ > \n \n == Classification == \n [[File:Kirkwood-20060509.png|thumb|Showing [[Kirkwood gaps]], by showing positions based on their semi-major axis]] \n Asteroids are commonly categorized according to two criteria: the characteristics of their orbits, and features of their reflectance [[visible spectrum|spectrum]]. \n \n === Orbital classification === \n {{Main|Asteroid group|Asteroid family}} \n Many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Apart from the broadest divisions, it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered. Groups are relatively loose dynamical associations, whereas families are tighter and result from the catastrophic break-up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past. < ref name=AstFams-Icarus-1995/ >  Families are more common and easier to identify within the main asteroid belt, but several small families have been reported among the [[Jupiter trojan]]s. < ref name= \" JewittEtal2004 \" / >  Main belt families were first recognized by [[Kiyotsugu Hirayama]] in 1918 and are often called [[Hirayama families]] in his honor. \n \n About 30\u201335% of the bodies in the asteroid belt belong to dynamical families each thought to have a common origin in a past collision between asteroids. A family has also been associated with the plutoid [[dwarf planet]] {{dp|Haumea}}. \n \n ==== Quasi-satellites and horseshoe objects ==== \n Some asteroids have unusual [[horseshoe orbit]]s that are co-orbital with [[Earth]] or some other planet. Examples are [[3753 Cruithne]] and {{mpl|2002 AA|29}}. The first instance of this type of orbital arrangement was discovered between [[Saturn]]'s moons [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]] and [[Janus (moon)|Janus]]. \n \n Sometimes these horseshoe objects temporarily become [[quasi-satellite]]s for a few decades or a few hundred years, before returning to their earlier status. Both Earth and [[Venus]] are known to have quasi-satellites. \n \n Such objects, if associated with Earth or Venus or even hypothetically [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], are a special class of [[Aten asteroid]]s. However, such objects could be associated with outer planets as well. \n \n === Spectral classification === \n {{Main|Asteroid spectral types}} \n [[File:433eros.jpg|thumb|This picture of [[433 Eros]] shows the view looking from one end of the asteroid across the gouge on its underside and toward the opposite end. Features as small as {{cvt|35|m|0}} across can be seen.]] \n In 1975, an asteroid [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] system based on [[color]], [[albedo]], and [[spectral line|spectral shape]] was developed by [[Clark R. Chapman|Chapman]], [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|Morrison]], and [[Ben Zellner|Zellner]]. < ref name=CMZ-1975-Icarus/ >  These properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroid's surface material. The original classification system had three categories: [[C-type asteroid|C-types]] for dark carbonaceous objects (75% of known asteroids), [[S-type asteroid|S-types]] for stony (silicaceous) objects (17% of known asteroids) and U for those that did not fit into either C or S. This classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types. The number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied. \n \n The two most widely used taxonomies now used are the [[Tholen classification]] and [[SMASS classification]]. The former was proposed in 1984 by [[David J. Tholen]], and was based on data collected from an eight-color asteroid survey performed in the 1980s. This resulted in 14 & nbsp;asteroid categories. < ref name=Tholen-1989/ >  In 2002, the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey resulted in a modified version of the Tholen taxonomy with 24 & nbsp;different types. Both systems have three broad categories of C, S, and X asteroids, where X consists of mostly metallic asteroids, such as the [[M-type asteroid|M-type]]. There are also several smaller classes. < ref name=Bus-2002/ > \n \n The proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type; some types are easier to detect than others, biasing the totals. \n \n ==== Problems ==== \n Originally, spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroid's composition. < ref name=McSween-1999/ >  However, the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good, and a variety of classifications are in use. This has led to significant confusion. Although asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials, there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of the same (or similar) materials. \n \n == Naming == \n {{Main|Minor planet#Naming}} \n [[File:Asteroid20130318-full.jpg|thumb|right|[[2013 EC]], shown here in radar images, has a provisional designation]] \n A newly discovered asteroid is given a [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] (such as {{mpl|2002 AT|4}}) consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code indicating the [[half-month]] of discovery and the sequence within that half-month. Once an asteroid's orbit has been confirmed, it is given a number, and later may also be given a name (e.g. {{nowrap|[[433 Eros]]}}). The formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number \u2013 e.g. (433) & nbsp;Eros \u2013 but dropping the parentheses is quite common.

He introduced a disk (circle), a traditional symbol for a star, as the generic symbol for an asteroid. The circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid (although he assigned \u2460 to the fifth, [[5 Astraea|Astraea]], while continuing to designate the first four only with their existing iconic symbols). The numbered-circle convention was quickly adopted by astronomers, and the next asteroid to be discovered ([[16 Psyche]], in 1852) was the first to be designated in that way at the time of its discovery. However, Psyche was given an iconic symbol as well, as were a few other asteroids discovered over the next few years (see chart above). [[20 Massalia]] was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol, and no iconic symbols were created after the 1855 discovery of [[37 Fides]].{{efn|Except for Pluto and, in the astrological community, for a few outer bodies such as [[2060 Chiron]].}} That year Astraea's number was increased to \u2464, but the first four asteroids, Ceres to Vesta, were not listed by their numbers until the 1867 edition. The circle was soon abbreviated to a pair of parentheses, which were easier to typeset and sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades, leading to the modern convention. < ref name= \" hilton \" / > \n \n == Exploration == \n {{see also|Sample-return mission|Asteroid mining|Colonization of the asteroids}} \n [[File:Eros rotation Dec. 3-4 2000.gif|thumb|Eros as seen by visiting spacecraft]] \n Until the age of [[Spaceflight|space travel]], objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery. The best modern ground-based telescopes and the Earth-orbiting [[Hubble Space Telescope]] can resolve a small amount of detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids, but even these mostly remain little more than fuzzy blobs. Limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their [[light curve]]s (their variation in brightness as they rotate) and their spectral properties, and asteroid sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occultations (when an asteroid passes directly in front of a star). [[Radar]] imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters, especially for near-Earth asteroids. In terms of [[delta-v]] and propellant requirements, NEOs are more easily accessible than the Moon. < ref name=AIAA_NEO_feasibility/ > \n \n The first close-up photographs of asteroid-like objects were taken in 1971, when the ''[[Mariner 9]]'' probe imaged [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], the two small moons of [[Mars]], which are probably captured asteroids. These images revealed the irregular, potato-like shapes of most asteroids, as did later images from the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes of the small moons of the [[gas giant]]s. \n \n The first true asteroid to be photographed in close-up was [[951 Gaspra]] in 1991, followed in 1993 by [[243 Ida]] and its moon [[Dactyl (asteroid)|Dactyl]], all of which were imaged by the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' probe]] en route to [[Jupiter]]. \n \n The first dedicated asteroid probe was ''[[NEAR Shoemaker]]'', which photographed [[253 Mathilde]] in 1997, before entering into orbit around [[433 Eros]], finally landing on its surface in 2001. \n \n Other asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft en route to other destinations include [[9969 Braille]] (by ''[[Deep Space 1]]'' in 1999), and [[5535 Annefrank]] (by ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'' in 2002). \n \n From September to November & nbsp;2005, the Japanese ''[[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|Hayabusa]]'' probe studied [[25143 Itokawa]] in detail and was plagued with difficulties, but [[Sample return mission|returned samples]] of its surface to Earth on 13 & nbsp;June 2010. \n \n The European [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|''Rosetta'' probe]] (launched in 2004) flew by [[2867 \u0160teins]] in 2008 and [[21 Lutetia]], the third-largest asteroid visited to date, in 2010. \n \n In September & nbsp;2007, [[NASA]] launched the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'' spacecraft]], which orbited [[4 Vesta]] from July & nbsp;2011 to September & nbsp;2012, and has been orbiting the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|1 & nbsp;Ceres]] since 2015. 4 & nbsp;Vesta is the second-largest asteroid visited to date. \n \n On 13 & nbsp;December 2012, China's lunar orbiter ''[[Chang'e 2]]'' flew within {{cvt|2|mi|km|order=flip}} of the asteroid [[4179 Toutatis]] on an extended mission. \n \n The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched the ''[[Hayabusa2]]'' probe in December & nbsp;2014, and plans to return samples from [[162173 Ryugu]] in December & nbsp;2020. \n \n In June & nbsp;2018, the US [[National Science and Technology Council]] warned that America is unprepared for an [[Asteroid impact avoidance|asteroid impact event]], and has developed and released the '' \" National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy Action Plan \" '' to better prepare. < ref name= \" WH-20180621 \" / > < ref name= \" GIZ-20180621 \" / > < ref name= \" ICARUS-220180522 \" / > < ref name= \" NYT-20180614c \" / > \n [[File:Bennu 330km 181029.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Bennu]] \n In September & nbsp;2016, NASA launched the [[OSIRIS-REx]] sample return mission to asteroid [[101955 Bennu]], which it reached in December & nbsp;2018. {{As of|2019|06}}, the probe is in orbit around the asteroid. < ref name=NewSci2019Jun18/ > \n \n === Planned and future missions === \n [[File:Lucy--mission-13--v3.png|thumb|Planned Lucy spacecraft]] \n In early 2013, NASA announced the planning stages of a mission to capture a near-Earth asteroid and move it into lunar orbit where it could possibly be visited by astronauts and later impacted into the Moon. < ref name=Wall2013Sep30/ >  On 19 & nbsp;June 2014, NASA reported that asteroid [[2011 MD]] was a prime candidate for capture by a robotic mission, perhaps in the early 2020s. < ref name= \" AP-20140619 \" / > \n \n It has been suggested that asteroids might be used as a source of materials that may be rare or exhausted on Earth ([[asteroid mining]]), or materials for constructing [[space habitat]]s ''(see [[Colonization of the asteroids]])''.
