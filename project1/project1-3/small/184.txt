Professionals of the agricultural science are called agricultural scientists or [[agriculturists]]. \n \n ==History== \n {{Main|History of agricultural science}} \n \n In the 18th century, [[Johann Friedrich Mayer (agriculturist)|Johann Friedrich Mayer]] conducted experiments on the use of [[gypsum]] (hydrated [[calcium sulphate]]) as a fertilizer. < ref name= \" JB 1840 \" > John Armstrong, Jesse Buel.

The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. The [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built. < ref > Hillison J. (1996).

[[Blackwell Publishing]]. < /ref > {{rp|xxi}} \n < !-- \n Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and [[Developing country|developing countries]], often referred to as the [[Green Revolution]], was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s. \n \n As the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently [[intensive agriculture]], industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. These include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as [[integrated pest management]], [[waste management|waste treatment]] technologies, [[landscape architecture]], [[genomics]], and [[agricultural philosophy]] fields that include references to [[food industry|food production]] as something essentially different from non-essential economic 'goods'. In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science. \n \n New technologies, such as [[biotechnology]] and [[computer science]] (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including [[genetic engineering]], [[agrophysics]], improved [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[precision farming]]. Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of [[history of agriculture|traditional agriculture]], including interaction of [[Religion and Agriculture|religion and agriculture]], and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.-- > \n \n ==Prominent agricultural scientists== \n [[File:Norman Borlaug.jpg|thumb|200px|Norman Borlaug, father of the [[Green Revolution]].]] \n * [[Robert Bakewell (farmer)|Robert Bakewell]] \n * [[Norman Borlaug]] \n * [[Luther Burbank]] \n * [[George Washington Carver]] \n * [[Carl Henry Clerk]] \n * [[George C.

However, they cover different concepts: \n *Agriculture is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research. \n *[[Agronomy]] is [[research and development]] related to studying and improving plant-based crops. \n \n ==Research topics== \n Agricultural sciences include research and development on: < ref name= \" Bosso 2015 \" > {{cite book | last=Bosso | first=Thelma | title=Agricultural Science | publisher=Callisto Reference | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-63239-058-5}} < /ref > < ref name= \" Boucher 2018 \" > {{cite book | last=Boucher | first=Jude | title=Agricultural Science and Management | publisher=Callisto Reference  | year=2018 | isbn=978-1-63239-965-6}} < /ref > \n * Improving [[agricultural productivity]] in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of [[drought]]-resistant crops and animals, development of new [[pesticide]]s, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro [[cell culture]] techniques) \n * Minimizing the effects of pests ([[weed]]s, [[insect]]s, [[pathogen]]s, [[mollusk]]s, [[nematode]]s) on crop or animal production systems. \n * Transformation of primary products into end-consumer products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of [[dairy product]]s) \n * Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], [[waste management]], [[bioremediation]]) \n * [[Theoretical production ecology]], relating to crop production modeling \n * Traditional agricultural systems, sometimes termed [[subsistence agriculture]], which feed most of the poorest people in the world.  These systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological systems greater than that of [[industrial agriculture]], which may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems. \n * Food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers, such as China, India, Brazil, the US and the EU. \n * Various sciences relating to agricultural resources and the environment (e.g. soil science, agroclimatology); biology of agricultural crops and animals (e.g. crop science, animal science and their included sciences, e.g. ruminant nutrition, farm animal welfare); such fields as agricultural economics and rural sociology; various disciplines encompassed in [[agricultural engineering]]. \n \n ==See also== \n * [[Agricultural Research Council]] \n * [[Agricultural sciences basic topics]] \n * [[Agriculture ministry]] \n * [[Agroecology]] \n * [[American Society of Agronomy]] \n * [[Genomics of domestication]] \n * [[History of agricultural science]] \n * [[Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences]] \n * [[International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development]] \n * [[International Food Policy Research Institute]], IFPRI \n * [[List of agriculture topics]] \n * [[National FFA Organization]] \n * [[Research Institute of Crop Production]] (RICP) (in the Czech Republic) \n * [[University of Agricultural Sciences (disambiguation)|University of Agricultural Sciences]] \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist}} \n \n ==Further reading== \n *[https://web.archive.org/web/20080829120156/http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title_pages/9358.html Agricultural Research, Livelihoods, and Poverty: Studies of Economic and Social Impacts in Six Countries] Edited by Michelle Adato and Ruth Meinzen-Dick (2007), Johns Hopkins University Press Food Policy Report < ref name= \" Brief \" > [http://www.ifpri.org/publication/agricultural-research-livelihoods-and-poverty Agricultural research, livelihoods, and poverty | International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626071001/http://www.ifpri.org/publication/agricultural-research-livelihoods-and-poverty |date=26 June 2010 }} < /ref > \n *Claude Bourguignon, ''Regenerating the Soil: From Agronomy to Agrology'', Other India Press, 2005 \n *Pimentel David, Pimentel Marcia, ''Computer les kilocalories'', C\u00e9r\u00e8s, n. 59, sept-oct. 1977 \n *Russell E.
