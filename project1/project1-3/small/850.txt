[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]. 23 September 2008. < /ref >  It was originally named ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]] because it was the sixth month in the original ten-month [[Roman calendar]] under [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]] in 753 BC, with [[March]] being the first month of the year. About 700 & nbsp;BC, it became the eighth month when [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the year before March by King [[Numa Pompilius]], who also gave it 29 days. [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in 46 BC (708 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]]), giving it its modern length of 31 days. In 8 BC, it was renamed in honor of [[Augustus]]. According to a [[Senatus consultum]] quoted by [[Macrobius]], he chose this month because it was the time of several of his great triumphs, including the conquest of [[Egypt]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:id=calendarium-cn|title=Year of Julius Caesar, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (1890), William Smith, LLD, William Wayte, G. E. Marindin, Ed.}} < /ref > \n \n In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], August is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. In the Northern Hemisphere, August falls in the season of summer. In the Southern Hemisphere, the month falls during the season of winter. In many European countries, August is the holiday month for most workers. Numerous religious holidays occurred during August in ancient Rome. < ref > [[Supplicia canum]] was held on August 3, [[Lychnapsia]] on August 12, [[Nemoralia]] was held from August 13\u201315 (or on the full moon of August), [[Tiberinalia]] and [[Portunus (mythology)|Portumnalia]] on August 17, [[Consualia|Consuales Ludi]] on August 18, [[Vinalia|Vinalia rustica]] on August 19, [[Vulcan (mythology)#Vulcanalia|Vulcanalia]] on August 23, [[Opiconsivia]] on August 25, and [[Volturnalia]] on August 27. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. < /ref > \n \n Certain [[meteor shower]]s take place in August. The [[Kappa Cygnids]] take place in August, with the dates varying each year. The [[Alpha Capricornids]] meteor shower takes place as early as July 10 and ends at around August 10, and the  Southern Delta Aquariids take  place from mid-July to mid-August, with the peak usually around July 28\u201329. The [[Perseids]], a major meteor shower, typically takes place between July 17 and August 24, with the days of the peak varying yearly. The star cluster of [[Messier 30]] is best observed around August. \n \n Among the aborigines of the [[Canary Islands]], especially among the [[Guanches]] of [[Tenerife]], the month of August received in the name of Be\u00f1esmer or [[Be\u00f1esmen]], which was also the harvest festival held this month. < ref > {{cite book |last=Abr\u00e9u Galindo |first=Juan de |author-link=Juan de Abr\u00e9u Galindo |title=Historia de la conquista de las siete islas de Gran Canaria |url=http://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/ref/collection/MDC/id/70784 |year=1848 |orig-year=1632 |publisher=Imprenta, Litograf\u00eda y Librer\u00eda Isle\u00f1a |location=Santa Cruz de Tenerife}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite book |last=Torriani |first=Leonardo |author-link=Leonardo Torriani |title=Descripci\u00f3n e historia del reino de las Islas Canarias: antes Afortunadas, con el parecer de sus fortificaciones |url=http://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/ref/collection/MDC/id/44103 |year=1959 |orig-year=1590 |publisher=Goya Ediciones |location=Santa Cruz de Tenerife}} < /ref > \n \n ==August symbols== \n [[File:Gladiolus imbricatus1002.jpg|thumb|[[Gladiolus]]]] \n *[[File:Peridot-China.jpg|alt=Peridot gemstones|thumb|[[Peridot]] gemstones]][[File:Sardonyx Inscription.JPG|alt=Sardonyx stone|thumb|[[Sardonyx]] stone]][[File:Spinel-Calcite-258747.jpg|alt=Red spinel on calcite|thumb|Red [[spinel]] on [[calcite]]]]August's [[birthstone]]s are the [[peridot]], [[sardonyx]], and [[spinel]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.americangemsociety.org/en/august-birthstones|title=Why the American Gem Society|website=American Gem Society}} < /ref > \n *Its [[birth flower]] is the [[gladiolus]] or [[poppy]], meaning beauty, strength of character, love, marriage and family. < ref > [https://archive.is/20120911093344/http://www.shgresources.com/gems/birthflowers/ Birth months, flowers, and gemstones], shgresources.com < /ref > \n *The [[Zodiac|Western zodiac]] signs for the month of August are [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] (until August 22) and [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] (from August 23 onwards). < ref > The Earth passes the junction of the signs at 15:44 UT/GMT August 22, 2020, and will pass it again at 21:34 UT/GMT August 22, 2021. < /ref > < ref name=astrology > {{citation |title=Astrology Calendar |url=https://www.yourzodiacsign.com/calendar/ |website=yourzodiacsign}}.
