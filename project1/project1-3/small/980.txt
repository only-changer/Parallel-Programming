Among the Buddha's many disciples, \u0100nanda stood out for having the best memory. Most of the [[sutra|texts]] of the early Buddhist ''[[Sutta Pitaka|Sutta-Pi\u1e6daka]]'' ([[P\u0101li]]; {{lang-sa|S\u016btra-Pi\u1e6daka|italic=yes}}) are attributed to his recollection of the Buddha's teachings during the [[First Buddhist Council]]. For that reason, he is known as the '''Treasurer of the Dhamma''', with ''[[Dhamma]]'' ({{lang-sa|Dharma|italic=yes |link=no}}) referring to the Buddha's teaching. In [[Early Buddhist Texts]], \u0100nanda was the first cousin of the Buddha. Although the early texts do not agree on many parts of \u0100nanda's early life, they do agree that \u0100nanda was ordained as a monk and that [[Pu\u1e47\u1e47a Mant\u0101n\u012bputta]] ({{lang-sa|P\u016br\u1e47a Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47\u012bputra|link=no}}) became his teacher. Twenty years in the Buddha's ministry, \u0100nanda became the attendant of the Buddha, when the Buddha selected him for this task. \u0100nanda performed his duties with great devotion and care, and acted as an intermediary between the Buddha and the laypeople, as well as the ''[[sa\u1e45gha]]'' ({{lang-sa|sa\u1e43gha|italic=yes|link=no|lit=monastic community}}). He accompanied the Buddha for the rest of his life, acting not only as an assistant, but also a secretary and a mouthpiece. \n \n Scholars are skeptical about the historicity of many events in \u0100nanda's life, especially the First Council, and consensus about this has yet to be established. A traditional account can be drawn from early texts, [[atthakatha|commentaries]], and [[post-canonical Buddhist texts|post-canonical chronicles]]. \u0100nanda had an important role in establishing the order of ''[[bhikkhuni|bhikkhun\u012bs]]'' ({{lang-sa|bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b|italic=yes|link=no |lit=female mendicant}}), when he requested the Buddha on behalf of the latter's foster-mother [[Mahapajapati|Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati Gotam\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101praj\u0101pat\u012b Gautam\u012b|link=no}}) to allow her to be ordained. \u0100nanda also accompanied the Buddha in the last year of his life, and therefore was witness to many tenets and principles that the Buddha conveyed before his death, including the well-known principle that the Buddhist community should take his teaching and discipline as their refuge, and that he would not appoint a new leader. The final period of the Buddha's life also shows that \u0100nanda was very much attached to the Buddha's person, and he saw the Buddha's passing with great sorrow. \n \n Shortly after the Buddha's death, the First Council was convened, and \u0100nanda managed to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] just before the council started, which was a requirement. He had a historical role during the council as the living memory of the Buddha, reciting many of the Buddha's discourses and checking them for accuracy. During the same council, however, he was chastised by [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa|link=no}}) and the rest of the ''sa\u1e45gha'' for allowing women to be ordained and failing to understand or respect the Buddha at several crucial moments. \u0100nanda continued to teach until the end of his life, passing on his spiritual heritage to his pupils [[Shanavasa|S\u0101\u1e47av\u0101s\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|\u015a\u0101\u1e47akav\u0101s\u012b|link=no}}) and Majjhantika ({{lang-sa|Madhy\u0101ntika|link=no}}), among others, who later assumed leading roles in the [[Second Buddhist Council|Second]] and [[Third Buddhist Council|Third Councils]]. \u0100nanda died 20 years after the Buddha, and ''[[st\u016bpa]]s'' (monuments) were erected at the river where he died. \n \n \u0100nanda is one of the most loved figures in Buddhism. He was known for his memory, erudition and compassion, and was often praised by the Buddha for these matters. He functioned as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to the Buddha, however, in that he still had worldly attachments and was not yet enlightened, as opposed to the Buddha. In the [[agama (Buddhism)|Sanskrit textual traditions]], \u0100nanda is considered the patriarch of the Dhamma who stood in a spiritual lineage, receiving the teaching from Mah\u0101kassapa and passing them on to his own pupils. \u0100nanda has been honored by ''bhikkhun\u012bs'' since early medieval times for his merits in establishing the nun's order. In recent times, the composer [[Richard Wagner]] and Indian poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]] were inspired by stories about \u0100nanda in their work. \n \n == Name == \n The word ''\u0101nanda'' means 'bliss, joy' in P\u0101li and in Sanskrit.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=\u0100nanda}} < ref name= \" Larson \" > {{cite encyclopedia |last1=Larson |first1=Paul |editor1-last=Leeming |editor1-first=David A. |editor2-last=Madden |editor2-first=Kathryn |editor3-last=Marlan |editor3-first=Stanton |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion |title=Ananda |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=978-0-387-71802-6 |page=35}} < /ref >  P\u0101li [[Atthakatha|commentaries]] explain that when \u0100nanda was born, his relatives were joyous about this.

He met the attendant of Padumuttara Buddha and aspired to be like him in a future life. After having done many [[merit (Buddhism)|good deeds]], he made his resolution known to the Padumuttara Buddha, who confirmed that his wish will come true in a future life. After having been [[samsara|born and reborn]] throughout many lifetimes, and doing many good deeds, he was born as \u0100nanda in the time of the [[Gautama Buddha|current Buddha Gotama]].{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |p=535}} \n \n === Early life === \n [[File:Mahajanapadas (c. 500 BCE).png|thumb|Map of India, {{circa}} 500 BCE |alt=Map of India with names of major areas |upright=1.4]] \n \u0100nanda was born in the same time period as the Buddha (formerly Prince Siddhattha), which scholars place at 5th{{en dash}}4th centuries BCE. < ref name= \" Sarao \" > {{cite encyclopedia |last1=Sarao |first1=K.

In order to prevent \u0100nanda from leaving the palace to ordain, his father brought him to [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Ves\u0101l\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Vai\u015b\u0101l\u012b|link=no}}) during the Buddha's visit to Kapilavatthu, but later the Buddha met and taught \u0100nanda nonetheless.{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |pp=529{{en dash}}30}} On a similar note, the Mah\u0101vastu relates, however, that M\u1e5bg\u012b was initially opposed to \u0100nanda joining the holy life, because his brother Devadatta had already ordained and left the palace. \u0100nanda responded to his mother's resistance by moving to Videha ({{lang-sa|Vaideha|link=no}}) and lived there, taking a vow of silence.

regard to having women ordained, \u0100nanda answered that he had done this with great effort, because Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati was the Buddha's foster-mother who had long provided for him.{{sfn |Ohnuma |2006 |p=867}} With regard to not requesting the Buddha to continue to live, many textual traditions have \u0100nanda respond by saying he was distracted by M\u0101ra,{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=C\u0101p\u0101lacaitya}} though one early Chinese text has \u0100nanda reply he did not request the Buddha to prolong his life, for fear that this would interfere with the next Buddha [[Maitreya]]'s ministry. < ref name= \" Ch'en \"  / > \n \n According to the P\u0101li tradition, the charges were laid after \u0100nanda had become enlightened and done all the recitations; but the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da tradition has it that the charges were laid before \u0100nanda became enlightened and started the recitations. In this version, when \u0100nanda heard that he was banned from the council, he objected that he had not done anything that went against the teaching and discipline of the Buddha. Mah\u0101kassapa then listed seven charges to counter \u0100nanda's objection. The charges were similar to the five given in P\u0101li.{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |p=532}} Other textual traditions list slightly different charges, amounting to a combined total of eleven charges, some of which are only mentioned in one or two textual traditions.{{sfn |Tsukamoto |1963 |p=820}} Considering that an enlightened disciple was seen to have overcome all faults, it seems more likely that the charges were laid before \u0100nanda's attainment than after. < ref name= \" Ch'en \" > {{cite journal |last1=Ch'en |first1=Kenneth |title=The Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101nas\u016btra and The First Council |journal=[[Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies]] |date=1958 |volume=21 |page=132 |doi=10.2307/2718621 |jstor=2718621}} < /ref > \n \n Indologists von Hin\u00fcber and [[Jean Przyluski]] argue that the account of \u0100nanda being charged with offenses during the council indicate tensions between competing [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist]] schools, i.e. schools that emphasized the [[sutra|discourses]] ({{lang-pi|sutta|italic=yes |link=no}}, {{lang-sa|s\u016btra|italic=yes |link=no}}) and schools that emphasized monastic discipline. These differences have affected the scriptures of each tradition: < !--253-- >  e.g. the P\u0101li and Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka textual traditions portray a Mah\u0101kassapa that is more critical of \u0100nanda than that the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da tradition depicts him, < !--254-- > {{sfn |Findly |1992 |pages=253{{en dash}}4}}{{sfn |Tsukamoto |1963 |p=821}} reflecting a preference for discipline above discourse on the part of the former traditions, and a preference for discourse for the latter.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |page=254}} Another example is the recitations during the First Council. The P\u0101li texts state that [[Upali|Up\u0101li]], the person who was responsible for the recitation of the monastic discipline, recited {{em|before}} \u0100nanda does: again, monastic discipline above discourse.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=487}} Analyzing six recensions of different textual traditions of the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' extensively, Bareau distinguished two layers in the text, an older and a newer one, the former belonging to the compilers that emphasized discourse, the latter to the ones that emphasized discipline; the former emphasizing the figure of \u0100nanda, the latter Mah\u0101kassapa. < !--70-- >  He further argued that the passage on M\u0101ra obstructing the Buddha was inserted in the fourth century BCE, and that \u0100nanda was blamed for M\u0101ra's doing by inserting the passage of \u0100nanda's forgetfulness in the third century BCE. < !--79-- >  The passage in which the Buddha was ill and reminded \u0100nanda to be his own refuge, on the other hand, Bareau regarded as very ancient, pre-dating the passages blaming M\u0101ra and \u0100nanda.{{sfn |Bareau |1979 |pages=70, 79{{en dash}}80}} In conclusion, Bareau, Przyluski and Horner argued that the offenses \u0100nanda were charged with were a later interpolation. Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' and with \u0100nanda's character as generally depicted in the texts.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |p=268}} \n \n ==== Historicity ==== \n Tradition states that the First Council lasted for seven months.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Council, 1st}} Scholars doubt, however, whether the entire canon was really recited during the First Council,{{sfn |Harvey |2013 |page=88}} because the early texts contain different accounts on important subjects such as meditation. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Gombrich |first1=Richard |author-link1=Richard Gombrich |title=How Buddhism Began: The Conditioned Genesis of the Early Teachings |date=2006 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-415-37123-0 |pages=96{{en dash}}7 |edition=2nd}} < /ref >  It may be, though, that early versions were recited of what is now known as the ''[[Vinaya-pitaka|Vinaya-pi\u1e6daka]]'' and ''Sutta-pi\u1e6daka''.{{sfn |Hirakawa |1993 |p=69}} Nevertheless, many scholars, from the late 19th century onward, have considered the historicity of the First Council improbable. Some scholars, such as orientalists [[Louis de La Vall\u00e9e-Poussin]] and D.P. Minayeff, thought there must have been assemblies after the Buddha's death, but considered only the main characters and some events before or after the First Council historical.{{sfn |Prebish |2005 |page=226}}{{sfn |Mukherjee |1994 |pp=453}} Other scholars, such as Bareau and Indologist [[Hermann Oldenberg]], considered it likely that the account of the First Council was written after the [[Second Buddhist Council|Second Council]], and based on that of the Second, since there were not any major problems to solve after the Buddha's death, or any other need to organize the First Council.{{sfn |Prebish |2005 |page=231}}{{sfn |Mukherjee |1994 |pp=454{{en dash}}6}} Much material in the accounts, and even more so in the more developed later accounts, deal with \u0100nanda as the unsullied intermediary who passes on the legitimate teaching of the Buddha.{{sfn |MacQueen |2005|pp=314{{en dash}}5}} On the other hand, archaeologist [[Louis Finot (archaeologist)|Louis Finot]], Indologist E. E. Obermiller and to some extent Indologist Nalinaksha Dutt thought the account of the First Council was authentic, because of the correspondences between the P\u0101li texts and the [[Agama (Buddhism)|Sanskrit traditions]].{{sfn |Mukherjee |1994 |p=457}} Indologist [[Richard Gombrich]], following [[Bhikkhu Sujato]] and Bhikkhu Brahmali's arguments, states that  \" it makes good sense to believe ... that large parts of the Pali Canon do preserve for us the ''[[Buddhavacana|Buddha-vacana]]'', 'the Buddha's words', transmitted to us via his disciple \u0100nanda and the First Council \" .{{sfn |Gombrich |2018 |p=73}} \n \n === Role and character === \n {{Quote box \n | title = The attendant \n | quote= \" He served the Buddha following him everywhere like a shadow, bringing him tooth wood and water, washing his feet, rubbing his body, cleaning his cell and fulfilling all his duties with the greatest care.

He also taught other disciples to memorize Buddhist doctrine. For these reasons, \u0100nanda became known as the  \" Treasurer of the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dhamma]] \"  ({{lang-pi |Dhamma-bha\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101g\u0101rika|italic=yes |link=no}}, {{lang-sa |Dharma-bha\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101g\u0101rika|italic=yes |link=no}}), < ref name= \" Sarao \"  / > {{sfn |Filigenzi |2006 |p=271}} ''Dhamma'' ({{lang-sa|Dharma|link=no |italic=yes}}) referring to the doctrine of the Buddha. < ref name= \" Bodhi \"  / >  Being the person who had accompanied the Buddha throughout a great part of his life, \u0100nanda was in many ways the living memory of the Buddha, without which the ''sa\u1e45gha'' would be much worse off.{{sfn |Filigenzi |2006 |page=271}} Besides his memory skills, \u0100nanda also stood out in that, as the Buddha's cousin, he dared to ask the Buddha direct questions. For example, after the death of [[Mahavira|Mah\u0101vira]] and the depicted subsequent conflicts among the [[Jain]] community, \u0100nanda asked the Buddha how such problems could be prevented after the Buddha's death.{{sfn |Clasquin |2013 |page=7}}{{sfn |Gethin |2001 |page=232}}{{refn |group=note |The Buddha responded with a discussion of the role of a teacher, a student and the teaching, and concluded that he himself had proclaimed his teaching well. < !--232-3-- >  He continued that disputes about [[vinaya|monastic discipline]] were not so much a problem, but disputes about  \" the path and the way \"  were. < !--234-- > {{sfn |Gethin |2001 |pages=232{{en dash}}4}}}} However, Findly argues that \u0100nanda's duty to memorize the Buddha's teachings accurately and without distortion, was  \" both a gift and a burden \" . \u0100nanda was able to remember many discourses verbatim, but this also went hand-in-hand with a habit of not reflecting on those teachings, being afraid that reflection might distort the teachings as he heard them.{{sfn |Findly |2003 |pages=375{{en dash}}6}} At multiple occasions, \u0100nanda was warned by other disciples that he should spend less time on conversing to lay people, and more time on his own practice. < !--372, 390-- >  Even though \u0100nanda regularly practiced meditation for long hours, he was less experienced in [[samadhi|meditative concentration]] than other leading disciples. < !--391-- > {{sfn |Findly |2003 |pp=372, 390{{en dash}}1}} Thus, judgment of \u0100nanda's character depends on whether one judges his accomplishments as a monk or his accomplishments as an attendant, and person memorizing the discourses.{{sfn |Findly |2003 |pages=375{{en dash}}6}} \n [[File:039 Ananda (25595327227).jpg|left|thumb |East Javanese relief of \u0100nanda, depicted weeping |alt=Monk in forest rubbing in his eye. |upright=1.2]] \n From a literary and pedagogical point of view, \u0100nanda often functioned as a kind of [[foil (literature)|foil]] in the texts, being an unenlightened disciple attending to an enlightened Buddha.{{sfn |Shaw |2006 |p=115}} < ref > {{cite book |last1=Swearer |first1=Donald K. |title=The Buddhist World of Southeast Asia |date=1995 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |isbn=978-0-7914-2459-9 |page=209 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kFBR2cMDD8sC}} < /ref >  Because the run-of the-mill person could identify with \u0100nanda, the Buddha could through \u0100nanda convey his teachings to the mass easily.{{sfn |Shaw |2006 |p=115}}{{sfn |Findly |2003 |p=379}} \u0100nanda's character was in many ways a contradiction to that of the Buddha: being unenlightened and someone who made mistakes. At the same time, however, he was completely devoted to service to the Buddha.{{sfn |Filigenzi |2006 |pages=270{{en dash}}1}} The Buddha is depicted in the early texts as both a father and a teacher to \u0100nanda, stern but compassionate. \u0100nanda was very fond of and attached to the Buddha, willing to give his life for him.{{sfn |Findly |2003 |page=375}} He mourned the deaths of both the Buddha and S\u0101riputta, with whom he enjoyed a close friendship: in both cases \u0100nanda was very shocked.{{sfn |Witanachchi |1965 |p=533}} \u0100nanda's faith in the Buddha, however, constituted more of a faith in a person, especially the Buddha's person, as opposed to faith in the Buddha's teaching.

According to a Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka text, however, when Devadatta had turned against the Buddha, \u0100nanda was not persuaded by him, and voted against him in a formal meeting. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Bareau |first1=Andr\u00e9 |author-link1=Andr\u00e9 Bareau |title=Les agissements de Devadatta selon les chapitres relatifs au schisme dans les divers Vinayapitaka |language=fr |trans-title=The Actions of Devadatta According to Chapters Related to Schism in the Various ''Vinayapitakas'' |journal=[[Ecole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient|Bulletin de l'\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient]] |date=1991 |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=92, 94{{en dash}}5, 107, 109{{en dash}}10 |doi=10.3406/befeo.1991.1769 }} < /ref >  \u0100nanda's late spiritual growth is much discussed in Buddhist texts, and the general conclusion is that \u0100nanda was slower than other disciples due to his worldly attachments and his attachment to the person of the Buddha, both of which were rooted in his mediating work between the Buddha and the lay communities.{{sfn |Findly |2003 |p=373}} \n \n === Passing on the teaching === \n After the Buddha's death, some sources say \u0100nanda stayed mostly in the West of India, in the area of [[Kosambi|Kosamb\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Kausamb\u012b |link=no}}), where he taught most of his pupils.{{sfn |Baruah |2000 |p=10}}{{sfn |Hirakawa |1993 |p=85}} Other sources say he stayed in the monastery at [[Ve\u1e37uvana]] ({{lang-sa|Ve\u1e47uvana|link=no}}).{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Ve\u1e47uvanavih\u0101ra}} Several pupils of \u0100nanda became well-known in their own right. According to post-canonical Sanskrit sources such as the [[Divyavadana|Divyavad\u0101na]] and the [[Asokavadana|A\u015bokavad\u0101na]], before the Buddha's death, the Buddha confided to \u0100nanda that the latter's student Majjhantika ({{lang-sa|Madhy\u0101ntika|link=no}}) would travel to Udy\u0101na, [[Kashmir]], to bring the teaching of the Buddha there.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Madhy\u0101ntika}}{{sfn |Baruah |2000 |page=8}} Mah\u0101kassapa made a prediction that later would come true that another of \u0100nanda's future pupils, [[Shanavasa|S\u0101\u1e47av\u0101s\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|\u015a\u0101\u1e47akav\u0101s\u012b, \u015a\u0101\u1e47akav\u0101sin or \u015a\u0101\u1e47\u0101vasika|link=no}}), would make many gifts to the ''sa\u1e45gha'' at [[Mathura|Mathur\u0101]], during a feast held from profits of successful business.

Prak\u1e5bti agrees, and it is revealed that the Buddha means something else than she does: he asks Prak\u1e5bti to ordain as a ''bhikkhun\u012b'', and live the celibate life as a kind of sister to \u0100nanda. At first, Prak\u1e5bti weeps in dismay, but after the Buddha explains that her current situation is a result of [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]] from her previous life, she understands and rejoices in the life of a ''bhikkhun\u012b''.{{sfn |App |2011 |pages=33{{en dash}}4, 43}} Apart from the spiritual themes, Wagner also addresses the faults of the caste system by having the Buddha criticize it. < ref name= \" Wagner \" > {{cite journal |date=10 August 1889 |orig-year=1856 |journal=The Musical World |volume=69 |issue=32 |page=531 |title=Sketch of Wagner's 'Die Sieger' |first=R. |last=Wagner |author-link=Richard Wagner |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/3cbd37e266b00c7d |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001222537/https://search.proquest.com/openview/3cbd37e266b00c7d |url-status=live |archive-date=1 October 2018}} < /ref > \n \n Drawing from [[Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy, Wagner contrasts desire-driven salvation and true spiritual salvation: by seeking deliverance through the person she loves, Prak\u1e5bti only affirms her ''[[will to live]]'' ({{lang-de|Wille zum Leben|italic=yes}}), which is blocking her from attaining deliverance. By being ordained as a ''bhikkhun\u012b'' she strives for her spiritual salvation instead. Thus, the early Buddhist account of Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati's ordination is replaced by that of Prak\u1e5bti. According to Wagner, by allowing Prak\u1e5bti to become ordained, the Buddha also completes his own aim in life:  \" [H]e regards his existence in the world, whose aim was to benefit all beings, as completed, since he had become able to offer deliverance{{em dash}}without mediation{{em dash}}also to woman. \" {{sfn |App |2011 |pages=34{{en dash}}5 |ps=: \" ... und somit seine erl\u00f6senden, allen Wesen zugewendeten Weltlauf als volendet ansieht, da er auch dem Weibe{{em dash}}unmittelbar{{em dash}}die Erl\u00f6sung zusprechen konnte. \" }} \n \n The same legend of \u0100nanda and Prak\u1e5bti was made into a short prose play by the Indian poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], called ''Chandalika''. ''Chandalika'' deals with the themes of spiritual conflict, caste and social equality, < !--Jain-- >  and contains a strong critique of Indian society. < !--Chowdurie-- >  Just like in the traditional account, Prak\u1e5bti falls in love with \u0100nanda, after he gives her self-esteem by accepting a gift of water from her. Prak\u1e5bti's mother casts a spell to enchant \u0100nanda. In Tagore's play, however, Prak\u1e5bti later regrets what she has done and has the spell revoked. < !--Jain-- > < ref > {{cite journal |last=Jain |first=R. |year=2016 |title=Tagore's Drama Synthesis of Myths, Legends and Folklores: A Medium of Social Reformation |journal=Dialogue{{nowrap| \u2013}} A Journal Devoted to Literary Appreciation |volume=12 |issn=0974-5556 |issue=1 |url=http://dialoguethejournal.mripub.com/index.php/dailogue/article/view/39/39 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/72qzVmXXd?url=http://dialoguethejournal.mripub.com/index.php/dailogue/article/view/39/39 |archive-date=1 October 2018 |url-status=dead |p=71 |access-date=1 October 2018 |df=dmy-all }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news |last1=Chowdurie |first1=Tapati |title=Quenching Prakriti's Thirst... |url=https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/quenching-prakritis-thirst/article18261076.ece |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001222603/https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/quenching-prakritis-thirst/article18261076.ece |archive-date=1 October 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=24 September 2018 |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=27 April 2017}} < /ref > \n \n == Notes == \n {{reflist |group=note |30em}} \n \n == Citations == \n {{reflist |20em}} \n \n == References == \n {{refbegin |30em}} \n * {{Citation |last1=Ambros |first1=Barbara R |title=A Rite of Their Own: Japanese Buddhist Nuns and the Anan k\u014dshiki |journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies |date=27 June 2016 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=207{{en dash}}50 |doi=10.18874/jjrs.43.1.2016.207-250|doi-access=free }} \n * {{Citation |last1=App |first1=Urs |title=Richard Wagner and Buddhism |date=2011 |publisher=UniversityMedia |isbn=978-3-906000-00-8 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nm0Q5F85PSAC}} \n * {{Citation |last1=Bareau |first1=Andr\u00e9 |author-link1=Andr\u00e9 Bareau |title=III.
