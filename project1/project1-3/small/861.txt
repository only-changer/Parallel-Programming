It has been in [[Opposition (Australia)|Opposition]] in the [[Parliament of Australia|federal parliament]] since the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 election]]. The ALP is a federal party, with [[List of state branches of the Australian Labor Party|political branches]] in each [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]]. They are currently in government in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Queensland]], [[Western Australia]], the [[Australian Capital Territory]], and the [[Northern Territory]]. The Labor Party is the oldest political party in Australia. \n \n The ALP was not founded as a federal party until after the first sitting of the Australian parliament in 1901. Nevertheless, it is regarded as descended from labour parties founded in the various Australian colonies by the emerging [[Australian labour movement|labour movement in Australia]], formally beginning in 1891. Colonial labour parties contested seats from 1891, and federal seats following [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] at the [[1901 Australian federal election|1901 federal election]]. The ALP formed the world's first [[List of Labour parties|labour party]] government as well as the world's first [[social-democratic]] government at a national level. < ref name=moadoph > {{cite web|last=Rhodes |first=Campbell |url=https://moadoph.gov.au/blog/a-perfect-picture-of-the-statesman-john-christian-watson/ |title=A perfect picture of the statesman: John Christian Watson |publisher=Museum of Australian Democracy |date=27 April 1904 |access-date=19 September 2017}} < /ref >  At the [[1910 Australian federal election|1910 federal election]], Labor was the first party in Australia to win a majority in either house of the Australian parliament.

According to [[Ross McMullin]], who wrote an official history of the Labor Party, the title page of the proceedings of [[Australian Labor Party National Conference|Federal Conference]] used the spelling  \" Labor \"  in 1902,  \" Labour \"  in 1905 and 1908, and then  \" Labor \"  from 1912 onwards.{{sfn|McMullin|1991|p=ix}} In 1908, [[James Catts]] put forward a motion at Federal Conference that  \" the name of the party be the Australian Labour Party \" , which was carried by 22 votes to two. A separate motion recommending state branches to adopt the name was defeated. There was no uniformity of party names until 1918, when Federal Conference resolved that state branches should adopt the name  \" Australian Labor Party \" , now spelled without a ''u''. Each state branch had previously used a different name, due to their different origins.{{sfn|McMullin|1991|p=116}}{{efn|According to ''[[The Australian Worker]]'', in 1918 the state parties comprised the Political Labor League (New South Wales), the Queensland Labor Party, the United Labor Party (South Australia), the Workers' Political Labor League (Tasmania), the Political Labor Council (Victoria), and the Australian Labor Federation (Western Australia). < ref > {{cite news |url = https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/72188541 |title = 'The Australian Labor Party': Labor's Uniform Name |newspaper=[[The Australian Worker]] |date=12 December 1918 }} < /ref >  However, according to the ''[[South Australian Register]]'', the state parties in New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria had already adopted the standardised name by 1917. < ref > {{cite news |url = https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/60323264 |title = What's in a Name? |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |date=15 September 1917 }} < /ref > }} \n \n Despite the ALP officially adopting the spelling without a ''u'', it took decades for the official spelling to achieve widespread acceptance. < ref > {{cite book |quote = The Commonwealth conference of the party adopted the spelling 'Labor' in the official title of the Labor Party, but the parliamentary debates did not follow suit.

So successful, less than a decade later at the [[1905 South Australian state election|1905 state election]], [[Thomas Price (South Australian politician)|Thomas Price]] formed the world's first stable Labor government. [[John Verran]] led Labor to form the state's first of many [[majority government]]s at the [[1910 South Australian state election|1910 state election]]. \n \n In 1899, [[Anderson Dawson]] formed a minority Labour < !-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context -- >  government in [[Queensland]], the first in the world, which lasted one week while the [[Conservatism|conservatives]] regrouped after a split. \n \n The colonial Labour < !-- Do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context. -- >  parties and the trade unions were mixed in their support for the [[Federation of Australia]].

However, the first Labour < !-- Do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context. -- >  leader and Prime Minister [[Chris Watson]] was a supporter of federation. \n \n Historian Celia Hamilton, examining New South Wales, argues for the central role of Irish Catholics. Before 1890, they opposed Henry Parkes, the main Liberal leader, and of free trade, seeing them both as the ideals of Protestant Englishmen who represented landholding and large business interests. In the strike of 1890 the leading Catholic, Sydney's Archbishop [[Patrick Francis Moran]] was sympathetic toward unions, but Catholic newspapers were negative.  After 1900, says Hamilton, Irish Catholics were drawn to the Labour Party because its stress on equality and social welfare fitted with their status as manual labourers and small farmers. In the 1910 elections Labour gained in the more Catholic areas and the representation of Catholics increased in Labour's parliamentary ranks. < ref > Celia Hamilton,  \" Irish\u2010Catholics of New South Wales and the Labor Party, 1890\u20131910. \"  ''Historical Studies: Australia  &  New Zealand'' (1958) 8#31: 254\u2013267. < /ref > \n \n === Early decades at the federal level === \n [[File:Labor 1901b.jpg|thumb|Group photograph of Federal Labour Party MPs elected to the Australian House of Representatives and Australian Senate at the inaugural 1901 election]] \n The [[1901 Australian federal election|federal parliament in 1901]] was contested by each state Labour Party.

The state branches formed their first majority governments in [[1910 New South Wales state election|New South Wales]] and [[1910 South Australian state election|South Australia]] in 1910, [[1911 Western Australian state election|Western Australia]] in 1911, [[1915 Queensland state election|Queensland]] in 1915 and [[1925 Tasmanian state election|Tasmania]] in 1925. Such success eluded equivalent social democratic and labour parties in other countries for many years. \n \n Analysis of the early NSW Labor caucus reveals  \" a band of unhappy amateurs \" , made up of blue collar workers, a squatter, a doctor, and even a mine owner, indicating that the idea that only the socialist working class formed Labor is untrue. In addition, many members from the working class supported the liberal notion of free trade between the colonies; in the first grouping of state MPs, 17 of the 35 were free-traders. \n \n In the aftermath of [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, support for socialism grew in trade union ranks, and at the 1921 All-Australian Trades Union Congress a resolution was passed calling for  \" the socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange. \"  The 1922 [[Australian Labor Party National Conference|Labor Party National Conference]] adopted a similarly worded  \" socialist objective, \"  which remained official policy for many years. The resolution was immediately qualified, however, by the  \" [[Maurice Blackburn|Blackburn]] amendment, \"  which said that  \" socialisation \"  was desirable only when was necessary to  \" eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features. \" {{sfn|McKinlay|1981|p=53}} In practice the socialist objective was a dead letter. Only once has a federal Labor government attempted to nationalise any industry ([[Ben Chifley]]'s bank nationalisation of 1947), and that was held by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] to be unconstitutional. The commitment to nationalisation was dropped by [[Gough Whitlam]], and [[Bob Hawke]]'s government carried out many free market reforms including the floating of the dollar and [[privatisation]] of state enterprises such as [[Qantas]] airways and the [[Commonwealth Bank]]. \n \n The Labor Party is commonly described as a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, and its constitution stipulates that it is a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.alp.org.au/platform/chapter_12.php |title=National Constitution of the ALP |year=2009 |work=Official Website of the Australian Labor Party |publisher=Australian Labor Party |access-date=26 December 2009 |quote=The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030014535/http://www.alp.org.au/platform/chapter_12.php |archive-date=30 October 2009 }} < /ref >  The party was created by, and has always been influenced by, the trade unions, and in practice its policy at any given time has usually been the policy of the broader labour movement. Thus at the first federal election 1901 Labor's platform called for a [[White Australia policy]], a citizen army and compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes.{{sfn|McKinlay|1981|p=19}} Labor has at various times supported high [[tariff]]s and low tariffs, [[conscription]] and [[pacifism]], White Australia and [[multiculturalism]], [[nationalisation]] and [[privatisation]], [[isolationism]] and internationalism. \n \n Historically, Labor and its affiliated unions were strong defenders of the White Australia policy, which banned all non-European migration to Australia. This policy was partly motivated by 19th century theories about  \" [[Racial hygiene|racial purity]] \"  and by fears of economic competition from low-wage overseas workers which was shared by the vast majority of Australians and all major political parties.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In practice the Labor party opposed all migration, on the grounds that immigrants competed with Australian workers and drove down wages, until after [[World War II]], when the [[Chifley Government]] launched a major immigration program. The party's opposition to non-European immigration did not change until after the retirement of [[Arthur Calwell]] as leader in 1967. Subsequently, Labor has become an advocate of [[multiculturalism]], although some of its trade union base and some of its members continue to oppose high immigration levels. \n \n === World War II and beyond === \n The [[Curtin Government|Curtin]] and [[Chifley Government|Chifley]] governments governed Australia through the latter half of the [[Second World War]] and initial stages of transition to peace. Labor leader [[John Curtin]] became prime minister in October 1941 when two independents crossed the floor of Parliament. Labor, led by Curtin, then led Australia through the years of the [[Pacific War]]. In December 1941, Curtin announced that  \" Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom \" , thus helping to establish the Australian-American alliance (later formalised as [[ANZUS]] by the [[Menzies Government (1949\u201366)|Menzies Government]]). Remembered as a strong war time leader and for a landslide win at the [[1943 Australian federal election|1943 federal election]], Curtin died in office just prior to the end of the war and was succeeded by [[Ben Chifley]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/curtin/ |title=John Curtin \u2013 Australia's PMs \u2013 Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |access-date=5 July 2013}} < /ref >  Chifley Labor won the [[1946 Australian federal election|1946 federal election]] and oversaw Australia's initial transition to a peacetime economy. \n \n Labor was defeated at the [[1949 Australian federal election|1949 federal election]].

Whitlam also lost the [[1977 Australian federal election|1977 federal election]] and subsequently resigned as leader. \n \n [[Bill Hayden]] succeeded Whitlam as leader in the [[1980 Australian federal election|1980 federal election]] the party managed to gain more seats however they still lost. In 1983, [[Bob Hawke]] became leader of the party after Hayden resigned to avoid a leadership spill. \n \n [[Bob Hawke]] led Labor back to office at the [[1983 Australian federal election|1983 federal election]] and the party won 4 elections under Hawke. In December 1991 [[Paul Keating]] defeated Bob Hawke in a leadership spill. The Party then won the [[1993 Australian federal election|1993 federal election]]. The [[Hawke\u2013Keating Government]] was in power for 13 years with 5 terms until defeated by [[John Howard]] at the [[1996 Australian federal election|1996 federal election]]. This was the longest period the party was in Government. \n \n [[Kim Beazley]] led the party to the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998 federal election]], winning 51 percent of the [[two-party-preferred vote]] but falling short on seats, and lost ground at the [[2001 Australian federal election|2001 federal election]]. [[Mark Latham]] led Labor to the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 federal election]] but lost further ground. Beazley replaced Latham in 2005. Beazley in turn was challenged by [[Kevin Rudd]]. \n \n Rudd went on to defeat John Howard at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]] with 52.7 percent of the two-party vote. The [[Rudd Government (2007\u20132010)|Rudd Government]] ended prior to the [[2010 Australian federal election|2010 federal election]] with the replacement of Rudd as leader of the Party by deputy leader [[Julia Gillard]]. The [[Gillard Government]] was commissioned to govern in a [[hung parliament]] following the election with a one-seat parliamentary majority and 50.12 percent of the two-party vote. The Gillard government lasted until 2013 when Gillard lost a leadership spill with Rudd becoming leader once again. The party subsequently lost the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]]. \n \n After the 2013 election, Rudd resigned as leader and [[Bill Shorten]] became leader of the party. The party narrowly lost the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 federal election]] however it gained 14 seats and was 7 seats away from majority Government. It remained in opposition after the [[2019 Australian federal election|2019 federal election]] despite having been ahead in opinion polls for 2 years. The party lost some of the seats it had gained at the previous election. After the 2019 election, Shorten stood down as leader.

The Platform provides the policy foundation from which we can continue to work towards the election of a federal Labor Government. \" < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.alp.org.au/platform/index.php |publisher=Australian Labor Party |title=ALP National Platform and Constitution 2007 |access-date=23 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820193739/http://www.alp.org.au/platform/index.php |archive-date=20 August 2006 |url-status=dead  }} < /ref > \n \n The platform gives a general indication of the policy direction which a future Labor government would follow, but does not commit the party to specific policies. It maintains that  \" Labor's traditional values will remain a constant on which all Australians can rely. \"  While making it clear that Labor is fully committed to a market economy, it says that:  \" Labor believes in a strong role for national government \u2013 the one institution all Australians truly own and control through our right to vote. \"  Labor  \" will not allow the benefits of change to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, or located only in privileged communities. The benefits must be shared by all Australians and all our regions. \"  The platform and Labor  \" believe that all people are created equal in their entitlement to dignity and respect, and should have an equal chance to achieve their potential. \"  For Labor,  \" government has a critical role in ensuring fairness by: ensuring equal opportunity; removing unjustifiable discrimination; and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth, income and status. \"  Further sections of the platform stress Labor's support for equality and human rights, labour rights and democracy. \n \n In practice, the platform provides only general policy guidelines to Labor's federal, state and territory parliamentary leaderships. The policy Labor takes into an election campaign is determined by the Cabinet (if the party is in office) or the Shadow Cabinet (if it is in opposition), in consultation with key interest groups within the party, and is contained in the parliamentary Leader's policy speech delivered during the election campaign. When Labor is in office, the policies it implements are determined by the Cabinet, subject to the platform. Generally, it is accepted that while the platform binds Labor governments, how and when it is implemented remains the prerogative of the parliamentary caucus. It is now rare for the platform to conflict with government policy, as the content of the platform is usually developed in close collaboration with the party's parliamentary leadership as well as the factions. However, where there is a direct contradiction with the platform, Labor governments have sought to change the platform as a prerequisite for a change in policy. For example, privatisation legislation under the Hawke government occurred only after holding a special national conference to debate changing the platform. \n \n == Party structure == \n {{labour|sp=uk|expanded=parties}} \n {{labour politics in Australia}} \n \n === National executive and secretariat === \n The [[Australian Labor Party National Executive]] is the party's chief administrative authority, subject only to Labor's [[Australian Labor Party National Conference|national conference]].

If a Labor prime minister resigns or dies in office, the deputy leader acts as prime minister and party leader until a successor is elected. The deputy prime minister also acts as prime minister when the prime minister is on leave or out of the country. Members of the Ministry are also chosen by Caucus, though the leader may allocate portfolios to the ministers. \n \n [[Anthony Albanese]] is the leader of the federal Labor party, serving since 30 May 2019. The deputy leader is [[Richard Marles]], also serving since 30 May 2019. \n \n === State and territory branches === \n {{main|List of state branches of the Australian Labor Party}} \n The Australian Labor Party is a federal party, consisting of eight branches from each state and territory. While the National Executive is responsible for national campaign strategy, each state and territory are an autonomous branch and are responsible for campaigning in their own jurisdictions for federal, state and local elections. State and territory branches consist of both individual members and [[affiliated trade union]]s, who between them decide the party's policies, elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office. \n \n Members join a state branch and pay a membership fee, which is graduated according to income.  The majority of [[Australian labour movement|trade unions in Australia]] are affiliated to the party at a state level. Union affiliation is direct and not through the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]]. Affiliated unions pay an affiliation fee based on the size of their membership. Union affiliation fees make up a large part of the party's income. Other sources of funds for the party include [[political funding in Australia|political donations]] and [[Elections in Australia#Public funding|public funding]].  \n \n Members are generally expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year, although there are differences in the rules from state to state. In practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings. Many members are only active during election campaigns. \n \n The members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences (usually held annually, although more frequent conferences are often held). These conferences decide policy, and elect state or territory executives, a state or territory president (an honorary position usually held for a one-year term), and a state or territory secretary (a full-time professional position). However, [[Australian Labor Party (Australian Capital Territory Branch)|ACT Labor]] directly elects its president. The larger branches also have full-time assistant secretaries and organisers. In the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state, however under recent national reforms at least 50% of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches. \n \n In some states it also contests local government elections or endorses local candidates. In others it does not, preferring to allow its members to run as non-endorsed candidates. The process of choosing candidates is called [[preselection]]. Candidates are preselected by different methods in the various states and territories. In some they are chosen by ballots of all party members, in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference, in still others by a combination of these two. \n \n The state and territory Labor branches are the following: \n {|class= \" wikitable \"  style= \" font-size:95%;

Although not expressly defined, Country Labor operates mainly within [[Regions of New South Wales#Informal divisions|rural New South Wales]], and is mainly seen as an extension of the [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|New South Wales branch]] that operates in rural electorates. \n \n Country Labor is a subsection of the ALP, and is used as a designation by candidates contesting elections in rural areas. The Country Labor Party is registered as a separate party in [[New South Wales]], < ref > [http://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/candidates_and_parties/registered_political_parties/list_of_registered_parties List of Registered Parties], Electoral Commission NSW. < /ref >  and is also registered with the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] (AEC) for federal elections. < ref name=aec > [http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/party_registration/Registered_parties/ Current register of political parties], Australian Electoral Commission. < /ref >  It does not have the same status in other states and, consequently, that designation cannot be used on the ballot paper. \n \n The creation of a separation designation for rural candidates was first suggested at the June 1999 ALP state conference in New South Wales. In May 2000, following Labor's success at the [[2000 Benalla state by-election|2000 Benalla by-election]] in Victoria, [[Kim Beazley]] announced that the ALP intended to register a separate  \" Country Labor Party \"  with the AEC; < ref name=boland > [https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/country-labor-new-direction Country Labor: a new direction?], 7 June 2000. Retrieved 29 September 2017 < /ref >  this occurred in October 2000. < ref name=aec/ >  The Country Labor designation is most frequently used in New South Wales. According to the ALP's financial statements for the 2015\u201316 financial year, NSW Country Labor had around 2,600 members (around 17 percent of the party total), but almost no assets. It recorded a severe funding shortfall at the [[2015 New South Wales state election|2015 New South Wales election]], and had to rely on a $1.68-million loan from the party proper to remain solvent. It had been initially assumed that the party proper could provide the money from its own resources, but the NSW Electoral Commission ruled that this was impermissible because the parties were registered separately. Instead the party proper had to loan Country Labor the required funds at a commercial interest rate. < ref > [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/nearinsolvent-country-labor-may-never-repay-168m-to-party/news-story/b760e84faa14fda082bbb33600ec4743 Near-insolvent Country Labor \u2018may never repay\u2019 $1.68m to party], ''[[The Australian]]'', 28 July 2017. < /ref > \n \n === Australian Young Labor === \n {{main|Australian Young Labor}} \n Australian Young Labor is the youth wing of the Australian Labor Party, where all members under age 26 are automatically members.

The two largest factions are [[Labor Right]]  and  [[Labor Left]]. Labor Right generally supports free-market policies and the US alliance and tends to be conservative on some social issues. The Labor Left favours more state intervention in the economy, is generally less enthusiastic about the US alliance and is often more progressive on social issues. The national factions are themselves divided into sub-factions, primarily state-based such as Centre Unity in New South Wales and Labor Forum in Queensland. \n \n Some trade unions are affiliated with the Labor Party and are also factionally aligned. The largest unions supporting the right faction are the [[Australian Workers' Union]] (AWU), the [[Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association]] (SDA) and the [[Transport Workers Union of Australia|Transport Workers Union]] (TWU). < ref name= \" afr.com \" > {{cite web |last1=Marin-Guzman |first1=David |title=Inside the union factions that rule the ALP conference |url=https://www.afr.com/news/policy/industrial-relations/inside-the-union-factions-that-rule-the-alp-conference-20181216-h19692 |website=Australian Financial Review |access-date=6 August 2019|date=16 December 2018 }} < /ref >  Important unions supporting the left include the [[Australian Manufacturing Workers Union]] (AMWU), [[United Workers Union]], the [[Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union]] (CFMMEU) and the [[Community and Public Sector Union]] (CPSU). < ref name= \" afr.com \" / > \n \n [[Preselection]]s are usually conducted along factional lines, although sometimes a non-factional candidate will be given preferential treatment (this happened with [[Cheryl Kernot]] in 1998 and again with [[Peter Garrett]] in 2004). Deals between the factions to divide up the safe seats between them often take place. Preselections, particularly for safe Labor seats, can sometimes be strongly contested. A particularly fierce preselection sometimes gives rise to accusations of [[branch stacking]] (signing up large numbers of nominal party members to vote in preselection ballots), [[personation]], multiple voting and, on occasions, fraudulent electoral enrolment. Trade unions were in the past accused of giving inflated membership figures to increase their influence over preselections, but party rules changes have stamped out this practice. Preselection results are sometimes challenged, and the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|National Executive]] is sometimes called on to arbitrate these disputes. \n \n == Federal election results == \n {|class= \" wikitable sortable \" \n |- \n !Election \n !Leader \n !Seats won \n !\u00b1 \n !Total votes \n !% \n !Status \n |- \n ![[1901 Australian federal election|1901]] \n |rowspan=7|[[Chris Watson]] \n |{{composition bar|14|75|hex={{Australian Labor Party/meta/color}}}} \n |{{increase}} 14 \n |79,736 \n |15.76% \n |style= \" background:#FFFF99;
