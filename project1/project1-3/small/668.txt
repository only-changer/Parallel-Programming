  "{{for|the American political party|Approval Voting Party}} \n {{Electoral systems}} \n \n [[File:Approval ballot.svg|thumb|right|On an approval ballot, the voter can select any number of candidates.]] \n '''Approval voting''' is a single-winner [[electoral system]] where each voter may select ( \" approve \" ) any number of candidates. The winner is the most-approved candidate. It is related to [[score voting]] in which voters give each option a score on a scale, and the option with the highest total of scores is selected. It is distinct from [[plurality voting]] in which a voter may choose only one option among several, whereby the option with the most votes is chosen\u2014even absent a majority. \n \n Proposals to implement approval voting for municipal elections were approved in referendums in Fargo, North Dakota, in 2018, and St. Louis, Missouri, in 2020. Fargo used approval voting in June 2020 to elect two at-large seats on its city council, < ref name= \" Ballotpedia Fargo \" > [https://ballotpedia.org/Fargo,_North_Dakota,_Measure_1,_Approval_Voting_Initiative_(November_2018) Fargo, North Dakota, Measure 1, Approval Voting Initiative (November 2018)], November 7, 2018 ''[[Ballotpedia]]'' < /ref > < ref name= \" Fargo approves \" > [https://ivn.us/2018/11/06/one-americas-famous-towns-becomes-first-nation-adopt-approval-voting/ One of America\u2019s Most Famous Towns Becomes First in the Nation to Adopt Approval Voting] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107185459/https://ivn.us/2018/11/06/one-americas-famous-towns-becomes-first-nation-adopt-approval-voting/|date=2018-11-07}}, accessed November 7, 2018 < /ref > < ref name= \" Fargo votes \" > {{cite web |url=https://www.publicnewsservice.org/2020-06-10/civic-engagement/fargo-becomes-first-u-s-city-to-try-approval-voting/a70495-1 |title=Fargo Becomes First U.S. City to Try Approval Voting |last=Moen |first=Mike |date=June 10, 2020 |work=Public News Service |access-date=December 3, 2020 }} < /ref > < ref name= \" St. Louis approves \" > {{cite web|last=|first=|date=November 4, 2020|title=St. Louis Voters Approve Nonpartisan Elections|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/missouri/articles/2020-11-04/st-louis-voters-approve-nonpartisan-elections|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 3, 2020|work=US News and World Report}} < /ref >  and St. Louis used it to advance two candidates in March 2021 [[Unified primary|nonpartian primaries for]] mayor and aldermen. < ref > {{Cite web|last=Rakich|first=Nathaniel|date=2021-03-01|title=In St. Louis, Voters Will Get To Vote For As Many Candidates As They Want|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/in-st-louis-voters-will-get-to-vote-for-as-many-candidates-as-they-want/|access-date=2021-03-04|website=FiveThirtyEight|language=en-US}} < /ref > < ref name= \" :0 \" > {{Cite web|title=March 2, 2021 Non-Partisan Primary Municipal Election|url=https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/board-election-commissioners/elections/election.cfm?customel_datapageid_524494=852866|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-04|website=City of St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners|language=en}} < /ref > \n \n == Description == \n \n Approval voting ballots show a list of the candidates running for that seat for each office being contested. Next to each name is a checkbox (or another similar way to mark  \" Yes \"  or  \" No \"  for that candidate). \n \n Each candidate may be treated as a separate question:  \" Do you approve of this person for the job? \"  Approval voting lets each voter indicate support for one, some, or all candidates. All votes count equally, and everyone gets the same number of votes: one vote per candidate, either for or against. Final tallies show how many voters support each candidate, and the winner is the candidate whom the most voters support. \n \n Ballots on which the voter marked every candidate the same (whether yes or no) usually have no effect on the outcome of the election. Each ballot separates candidates into two groups: those supported and those that are not. Each candidate approved is considered preferred to any candidate not approved, while the voter's preferences among approved candidates is unspecified, and likewise, the voter's preferences among unapproved candidates is also unspecified. \n == Usage == \n === Current use === \n In 2018, [[Fargo, North Dakota]], passed a local ballot initiative adopting approval voting for the city's local elections, and it was used to elect officials in June 2020, becoming the first United States city and jurisdiction to adopt approval voting. < ref name= \" Ballotpedia Fargo \" / > < ref name= \" Fargo approves \" / > < ref name= \" Fargo votes \" / > \n \n In November 2020, [[St. Louis, Missouri]] passed Proposition D to authorize a variant of approval voting (as unified primary) for municipal offices. < ref name= \" St. Louis approves \" / > < ref name= \" St. Louis Approval 1 \" / > < ref name= \" St. Louis Approval 2 \" / > \n \n ===History ===  \n [[file:The story of the greatest nations, from the dawn of history to the twentieth century - a comprehensive history, founded upon the leading authorities, including a complete chronology of the world, and (14765071792).jpg|300px|thumb|Rows of [[secret ballot|secret]] approval vote boxes from early 1900s [[Greece]], where the voter drops a marble to the right or left of the box, through a tube, one for each candidate standing]] \n [[Robert J.

Strategic Approval voting, with more than two options, involves the voter changing their approval threshold. The voter decides which options to give the ''same'' rating, even if they were to have a preference order between them. \n \n Approval voting allows for [[Tactical voting#Bullet voting|bullet voting]] and [[Tactical voting#Compromising|compromising]],  while it is immune to [[Tactical voting#Push-over|push-over]] and [[Tactical voting#Burying|burying]]. \n \n [[Tactical voting#Bullet voting|Bullet Voting]] occurs when a voter approves ''only'' candidate 'a' instead of ''both'' 'a' and 'b' for the reason that voting for 'b' can cause 'a' to lose. The voter would be satisfied with either 'a' or 'b' but has a moderate preference for 'a'. Were 'b' to win, this hypothetical voter would still be satisfied. \n \n [[Tactical voting#Compromising|Compromising]] occurs when a voter approves an ''additional'' candidate who is otherwise considered unacceptable to the voter to prevent an even worse alternative from winning. \n \n === Sincere voting === \n {{more citations needed section|date=June 2019}}Approval voting experts describe sincere votes as those  \" ... that directly reflect the true preferences of a voter, i.e., that do not report preferences 'falsely.' \" {{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=29}}  They also give a specific definition of a sincere approval vote in terms of the voter's [[preference|ordinal preferences]] as being any vote that, if it votes for one candidate, it also votes for any more preferred candidate.  This definition allows a sincere vote to treat strictly preferred candidates the same, ensuring that every voter has at least one sincere vote. The definition also allows a sincere vote to treat equally preferred candidates differently.  When there are two or more candidates, every voter has at least three sincere approval votes to choose from.  Two of those sincere approval votes do not distinguish between any of the candidates: vote for none of the candidates and vote for all of the candidates.  When there are three or more candidates, every voter has more than one sincere approval vote that distinguishes between the candidates. \n \n ==== Examples ==== \n \n Based on the definition above, if there are four candidates, A, B, C, and D, and a voter has a strict preference order, preferring A to B to C to D, then the following are the voter's possible sincere approval votes: \n *vote for A, B, C, and D \n *vote for A, B, and C \n *vote for A and B \n *vote for A \n *vote for no candidates \n \n If the voter instead equally prefers B and C, while A is still the most preferred candidate and D is the least preferred candidate, then all of the above votes are sincere and the following combination is also a sincere vote: \n *vote for A and C \n \n The decision between the above ballots is equivalent to deciding an arbitrary  \" approval cutoff. \"  All candidates preferred to the cutoff are approved, all candidates less preferred are not approved, and any candidates equal to the cutoff may be approved or not arbitrarily. \n \n === Sincere strategy with ordinal preferences === \n \n A sincere voter with multiple options for voting sincerely still has to choose which sincere vote to use. [[tactical voting|Voting strategy]] is a way to make that choice, in which case strategic approval voting includes sincere voting, rather than being an alternative to it. < ref name=probstrat > {{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1955800 | last = Niemi |first=R.

In some cases, approval voting can sincerely elect any one of the candidates, including a [[Condorcet winner]] and a [[Condorcet loser]], without the voter preferences changing.  To the extent that electing a Condorcet winner and not electing a Condorcet loser is considered desirable outcomes for a voting system, approval voting can be considered vulnerable to sincere, strategic voting. < ref > {{Cite journal | last = Yilmaz | first=M.

For a voter with dichotomous preferences, approval voting is [[strategy-proof]] (also known as strategy-free).{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=31}}  When all voters have dichotomous preferences and vote the sincere, strategy-proof vote, approval voting is guaranteed to elect the Condorcet winner, if one exists.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=38}}  However, having dichotomous preferences when there are three or more candidates is not typical.  It is an unlikely situation for all voters to have dichotomous preferences when there are more than a few voters. < ref name=probstrat/ > \n \n Having dichotomous preferences means that a voter has bi-level preferences for the candidates.  All of the candidates are divided into two groups such that the voter is indifferent between any two candidates in the same group and any candidate in the top-level group is preferred to any candidate in the bottom-level group.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=16\u201317}}  A voter that has strict preferences between three candidates\u2014prefers A to B and B to C\u2014does not have dichotomous preferences. \n \n Being strategy-proof for a voter means that there is a unique way for the voter to vote that is a strategically best way to vote, regardless of how others vote. In approval voting, the strategy-proof vote, if it exists, is a sincere vote.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=29}} \n ==== Approval threshold ==== \n \n Another way to deal with multiple sincere votes is to augment the ordinal preference model with an approval or acceptance threshold.  An approval threshold divides all of the candidates into two sets, those the voter approves of and those the voter does not approve of.  A voter can approve of more than one candidate and still prefer one approved candidate to another approved candidate.  Acceptance thresholds are similar.  With such a threshold, a voter simply votes for every candidate that meets or exceeds the threshold. < ref name=probstrat/ > \n \n With threshold voting, it is still possible to not elect the Condorcet winner and instead elect the Condorcet loser when they both exist.  However, according to Steven Brams, this represents a strength rather than a weakness of approval voting.  Without providing specifics, he argues that the pragmatic judgements of voters about which candidates are acceptable should take precedence over the [[Condorcet criterion]] and other social choice criteria. < ref name=critstrats > {{Cite journal |last1=Brams |first1=S.

On the one hand, approval voting fails the [[later-no-harm criterion]], so voting for a candidate can cause that candidate to win instead of a candidate more preferred by that voter.  On the other hand, approval voting satisfies the [[monotonicity criterion]], so not voting for a candidate can never help that candidate win, but can cause that candidate to lose to a less preferred candidate.  Either way, the voter can risk getting a less preferred election winner.  A voter can balance the risk-benefit trade-offs by considering the voter's cardinal utilities, particularly via the [[von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern utility theorem]], and the probabilities of how others vote. \n \n A [[Tactical voting#Myerson-Weber strategy|rational voter model]] described by [[Roger Myerson|Myerson]] and Weber specifies an approval voting strategy that votes for those candidates that have a positive prospective rating. < ref > {{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2938959 |last1=Myerson |first1=R. |last2=Weber |first2=R.

However, an optimal vote can require voting for a candidate and not voting for a more preferred candidate if there 4 candidates or more. < ref > {{Cite journal | last1=Dutta |first1=B |last2=De Sinopoli |first2=F. | last3=Laslier |first3= J.-F.| year = 2006 | title = Approval voting: three examples | journal = International Journal of Game Theory | volume = 35 | pages = 27\u201338 |doi=10.1007/s00182-006-0053-2 |s2cid=801286 }} < /ref > \n \n Other strategies are also available and coincide with the optimal strategy in special situations.  For example: \n * Vote for the candidates that have above average utility.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if the voter thinks that all pairwise ties are equally likely{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=85}} \n * Vote for any candidate that is more preferred than the expected winner and also vote for the expected winner if the expected winner is more preferred than the expected runner-up.

When the voter thinks that others are balancing their votes randomly and evenly, the strategy maximizes the voter's power or efficacy, meaning that it maximizes the probability that the voter will make a difference in deciding which candidate wins.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=74, 81}} \n \n Optimal strategic approval voting fails to satisfy the Condorcet criterion and can elect a [[Condorcet loser criterion|Condorcet loser]].  Strategic approval voting can guarantee electing the Condorcet winner in some special circumstances.  For example, if all voters are rational and cast a strategically optimal vote based on a common knowledge of how all the other voters vote except for small-probability, statistically independent errors in recording the votes, then the winner will be the Condorcet winner, if one exists. < ref > Laslier, J.-F.

As a result, they vote for any candidate with an above-average utility.  Most voters vote for only their first choice.  Only the Knoxville faction also votes for its second choice, Chattanooga.  As a result, the winner is Memphis, the Condorcet loser, with Chattanooga coming in second place.  In this scenario, the winner has minority approval (more voters disapproved than approved) and all the others had even less support, reflecting the position that no choice gave an above-average utility to a majority of voters. \n \n In the second scenario, all of the voters expect that Memphis is the likely winner, that Chattanooga is the likely runner-up, and that the pivot probability for a Memphis-Chattanooga tie is much larger than the pivot probabilities of any other pair-wise ties.  As a result, each voter votes for any candidate they prefer more than the leading candidate, and also vote for the leading candidate if they prefer that candidate more than the expected runner-up. Each remaining scenario follows a similar pattern of expectations and voting strategies. \n \n In the second scenario, there is a three-way tie for first place.  This happens because the expected winner, Memphis, was the Condorcet loser and was also ranked last by any voter that did not rank it first. \n \n Only in the last scenario does the actual winner and runner-up match the expected winner and runner-up.  As a result, this can be considered a stable strategic voting scenario. In the language of [[game theory]], this is an  \" equilibrium. \"   In this scenario, the winner is also the Condorcet winner. \n \n ===Dichotomous cutoff=== \n {{more citations needed section|date=June 2019}}As this voting method is cardinal rather than ordinal, it is possible to model voters in a way that does not simplify to an ordinal method. Modelling voters with a 'dichotomous cutoff' assumes a voter has an immovable approval cutoff, while having meaningful cardinal preferences. This means that rather than voting for their top 3 candidates, or all candidates above the average approval (which may result in their vote changing if one candidate drops out, resulting in a system that does not satisfy IIA), they instead vote for all candidates above a certain approval 'cutoff' that they have decided. This cutoff does not change, regardless of which and how many candidates are running, so when all available alternatives are either above or below the cutoff, the voter votes for all or none of the candidates, despite preferring some over others.  This could be imagined to reflect a case where many voters become disenfranchised and apathetic if they see no candidates they approve of. In a case such as this, many voters may have an internal cutoff, and would not simply vote for their top 3, or the above average candidates, although that is not to say that it is necessarily entirely immovable. \n \n For example, in this scenario, voters are voting for candidates with approval above 50% (bold signifies that the voters voted for the candidate): \n \n {| class= \" wikitable \"  style= \" text-align:center; width:600px; \" \n |- \n !

On the other hand, if voters' threshold for receiving a vote is fixed (say 50%), this is a dichotomous cutoff, and satisfies IIA as shown below: \n \n {| class= \" wikitable \"  style= \" text-align:center; width:600px; \" \n |+ A drops out, candidates voting for above average approval \n !

In this case, approval voting requires voters to make an additional decision of where to put their approval cutoff (see examples above). Depending on how this decision is made, approval voting satisfies different sets of criteria. \n \n There is no ultimate authority on which criteria should be considered, but the following are criteria that many voting theorists accept and consider desirable: \n * [[Unrestricted domain]]\u2014A voter may have any preference ordering among the alternatives. \n * [[Non-dictatorship]]\u2014There does not exist a single voter whose preference for the alternatives always determines the outcome regardless of other voters' preferences. \n * [[Pareto efficiency]]\u2014If every voter prefers candidate A to all other candidates, then A must be elected. (from [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]) \n * [[Majority criterion]]\u2014If there exists a majority that ranks (or rates) a single candidate higher than all other candidates, does that candidate always win? \n * [[Monotonicity criterion]]\u2014Is it impossible to cause a winning candidate to lose by ranking that candidate higher, or to cause a losing candidate to win by ranking that candidate lower? \n * [[Consistency criterion]]\u2014If the electorate is divided in two and a choice wins in both parts, does it always win overall? \n * [[Participation criterion]]\u2014Is voting honestly always better than not voting at all? (This is grouped with the distinct but similar Consistency Criterion in the table below.{{efn|Consistency implies participation, but not vice versa. For example, Score Voting complies with participation and consistency, but median ratings satisfies participation and fails consistency.}}) \n * [[Condorcet criterion]]\u2014If a candidate beats every other candidate in [[Condorcet method|pairwise comparison]], does that candidate always win? (This implies the majority criterion, above) \n * [[Condorcet loser criterion]]\u2014If a candidate loses to every other candidate in pairwise comparison, does that candidate always lose? \n * [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]]\u2014Is the outcome the same after adding or removing non-winning candidates? \n * [[Independence of clones criterion]]\u2014Is the outcome the same if candidates identical to existing candidates are added? \n * [[Reversal symmetry]]\u2014If individual preferences of each voter are inverted, does the original winner never win? \n \n {| class= \" wikitable \"  style= \" text-align:center \" \n |- style= \" font-size:90%; \" \n ! scope= \" col \"  colspan=2 | !!

Plurality voting can lead to voters abandoning their first choice in order to help a  \" lesser of evils \"  to win. \n * However, approval voting forces voters to face an initial voting tactical decision as to whether to vote for (or ''approve of'') their second-choice candidate or not. The voter may want to retain expression of preference of their favorite candidate over their second choice.  But that does not allow the same voter to express preference of their second choice over any other. \n * Approval ballots can be counted by existing machines designed for plurality elections, as ballots are cast, so that final tallies are immediately available after the election, without any upgrades to equipment. Approval counting can be completed at the local level and conveniently summed at the regional or national level. \n * If voters are sincere, approval voting would elect centrists at least as often as moderates of each extreme. If backers of relatively extreme candidates are insincere and  \" bullet vote \"  for that first choice, they can help that candidate defeat a compromise candidate who would have won if every voter had cast sincere preferences. \n * If voters are sincere, candidates trying to win an approval voting election might need as much as 100% approval to beat a strong competitor, and would have to find solutions that are fair to everyone to do so. However, a candidate may win a [[plurality voting system|plurality]] race by promising many perks to a simple majority or even a plurality of voters at the expense of the smaller voting groups. \n * Approval voting fails the majority criterion, because a candidate who is preferred by a majority of voters is not always elected. In some cases approval voting will elect a candidate that has greater overall utility than a candidate preferred by a mere majority, if the majority also approves a compromise candidate that includes representation of the minority. In other cases, with elections having three or more candidates, approval voting will fail to elect the candidate with greater overall utility also preferred by a majority, if a less moderate candidate within the majority view gains enough approvals from the majority to win, while core supporters of the less moderate candidate are more selective (i.e. vote only for the extreme candidate), leaving a third sizable minority unrepresented.  It can also fail a different majority criterion in that the winner can win with fewer than half the votes approving.  \n * Suppose a candidate is eliminated (say, for medical reasons) between a primary election and the party convention. With plurality voting, voters who supported the eliminated candidate lose their franchise. Approval voting affords representation to voters by counting their approvals among remaining candidates. \n * Approval voting without write-ins is easily reversed as [[disapproval voting]] where a choice is disavowed, as is already required in other measures in politics (e.g., representative [[recall election|recall]]). \n * Unlike plurality voting, approval voting allows voters to block a candidate by voting for several alternatives instead of just one, increasing the probability an alternative wins. \n * In contentious elections with large groups of organized voters who prefer their favorite candidate vastly over all others, approval voting may revert to [[plurality voting]]. Some voters support only their single favored candidate when they perceive the other candidates more as competitors to their preferred candidate than as compromise choices. Score voting and [[Majority Judgment]] allow these voters to give intermediate approval ratings, but at the cost of added ballot complexity and longer ballot counts. \n \n == Multiple winners == \n \n Approval voting can be extended to multiple winner elections.  \n \n *Extending Approval voting to multiple winner elections in order to obtain [[proportional representation]] is possible through the methods such as [[Proportional approval voting]] < ref > http://www2.math.uu.se/~svante/papers/sjV9.pdf < /ref > < ref > {{cite arxiv|eprint=1611.08691|last1=Brill|first1=Markus|title=Multiwinner Approval Rules as Apportionment Methods|last2=Laslier|first2=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|last3=Skowron|first3=Piotr|class=cs.GT|year=2016}} < /ref >  or [[Sequential proportional approval voting]]. The voters fills a standard approval-type ballot, but the ballots are counted in a specific way, that produces proportional representation. \n \n * The straightforward extension of approval balloting is sometimes called [[Multiple non-transferable vote|plurality-at-large voting]]. Each voter can select an unlimited number of candidates and the candidates with the most approval votes win. This does not provide [[proportional representation]] and is subject to the [[Burr dilemma]], among other problems. Therefore, voting reform advocates refrain from calling it ''approval voting.'' < ref > {{Cite web |url=https://www.electionscience.org/library/voting-systems-confused-with-approval-voting/ |title=Voting Systems Confused with Approval Voting |website=The Center for Election Science |access-date=March 12, 2020}} < /ref > \n \n * Other ways of extending Approval voting to multiple winner elections are [[satisfaction approval voting]] < ref > {{cite book|citeseerx=10.1.1.74.3284|title=Technologies for political representation and accountability|first=Enric|last=Plaza|access-date=2011-06-17|url=http://www.iiia.csic.es/~enric/papers/egov.pdf}} < /ref >  excess method, < ref > https://as.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/faculty/documents/Excess%20Method%20(final).pdf < /ref >  and minimax approval. < ref > {{cite book|doi=10.1145/1329125.1329365|url=http://pages.cs.aueb.gr/~markakis/research/aamas07-minmax.pdf|first1=Rob|title=Proceedings of the 6th international joint conference on Autonomous agents and multiagent systems - AAMAS '07|pages=1|last1=LeGrand|first2=Evangelos|last2=Markakis|first3=Aranyak|last3=Mehta|access-date=2011-06-17|year=2007|isbn=9788190426275|s2cid=13870664}} < /ref >  These methods use approval ballots but count them in different ways. \n \n == Ballot types == \n {{more citations needed section|date=June 2019}}Approval ballots can be of at least four semi-distinct forms. The simplest form is a blank ballot on which voters hand-write the names of the candidates they support. A more structured ballot lists all candidates, and voters mark each candidate they support. A more explicit structured ballot can list the candidates and provide two choices by each. (Candidate list ballots can include spaces for write-in candidates as well.) \n {| BORDER \n |- \n | [[File:Approvalballotname.png|160px]] \n | [[File:Approvalballotword.png|160px]] \n | [[File:Approvalballotmark.png|160px]] \n | [[File:Approvalballotchoice.png|160px]] \n |} \n \n All four ballots are theoretically equivalent. The more structured ballots may aid voters in offering clear votes so they explicitly know all their choices. The Yes/No format can help to detect an  \" undervote \"  when a candidate is left unmarked and allow the voter a second chance to confirm the ballot markings are correct. The  \" single bubble \"  format is incapable of producing invalid ballots (which might otherwise be rejected in counting). \n \n Unless the second or fourth format is used, fraudulently adding votes to an approval voting ballot does not invalidate the ballot (that is, it does not make it appear inconsistent). Thus, approval voting raises the importance of ensuring that the  \" chain of custody \"  of ballots is secure. \n \n == See also == \n {{portal|Politics}} \n * [[Voting system]] \u2013 many other ways of voting \n * [[Borda count]] \n * [[Bucklin voting]] \n * [[Condorcet method]] \n * [[First Past the Post]] (also called Single-Member Plurality or Relative Majority) \n * [[Instant-runoff voting]] (also called Ranked-Choice voting, Alternative voting and Preferential voting) \n * [[Score Voting]] (also called Range voting) \n * [[Schulze method]] \n * [[Proportional approval voting]] and [[Sequential proportional approval voting]] \n \n == Notes == \n {{notelist|30em}} \n \n == References == \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n \n === Sources === \n * {{cite book |last1=Brams |first1=Steven J. |last2=Fishburn |first2=Peter C. |date=1983 |title=Approval Voting |location=Boston |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |isbn=3764331240 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/approvalvoting00bram }} \n \n == External links == \n {{Wiktionary|approval}} \n * [http://www.electology.org/approval-voting Approval Voting] Article by [http://www.electology.org/ The Center for Election Science] \n * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZiS3U7EG0M Could Approval Voting Prevent Electoral Disaster?] Video by [[Big Think]] \n * [http://pareto.uab.cat/wp/2004/61904.pdf Approval Voting on Dichotomous Preferences] Article by Marc Vorsatz. \n * [http://pareto.uab.cat/wp/2004/61704.pdf Scoring Rules on Dichotomous Preferences] Article by Marc Vorsatz. \n * [http://www.universalworkshop.com/ARVOfull.htm The Arithmetic of Voting] article by Guy Ottewell \n * [http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/brams/avcritical.pdf Critical Strategies Under Approval Voting: Who Gets Ruled In And Ruled Out] Article by Steven J.
