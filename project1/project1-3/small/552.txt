George Routledge and Sons, London. < /ref >  In 1855, the government proposed another settlement on the islands, including a [[Cellular Jail|convict establishment]], but the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] forced a delay in its construction. However, because the rebellion gave the British so many prisoners, it made the new Andaman settlement and prison urgently necessary. Construction began in November 1857 at Port Blair using inmates' labour, avoiding the vicinity of a salt swamp that seemed to have been the source of many of the earlier problems at Port Cornwallis. \n \n 17 May 1859 was another major day for Andaman. The [[Battle of Aberdeen (Andaman Islands)|Battle of Aberdeen]] was fought between the [[Great Andamanese]] tribe and the British. Today, a memorial stands in Andaman water sports complex as a tribute to the people who lost their lives. Fearing foreign invasion and with help from an escaped convict from Cellular Jail, the Great Andamanese stormed the British post, but they were outnumbered and soon suffered heavy loss of life. Later, it was identified that an escaped convict named [[Dudhnath Tewari]] had changed sides and informed the British about the tribe's plans. Today, the tribe has been reduced to some 50 people, with less than 50% of them adults. The government of the Andaman Islands is making efforts to increase the headcount of this tribe. < ref name= \" Rapidiq \" > {{cite web|url=https://rapidiq.wordpress.com/2012/04/08/the-rise-and-the-fall-of-the-great-andamanese/|title=The Rise and Fall of the Great Andamanese|work=Confessions of a Linguist!|date=8 April 2012}} < /ref > \n < ref name= \" One India \" > {{cite web|url=http://www.oneindia.com/2007/05/17/who-are-heroes-of-battle-of-aberdeen-1179405748.html|title=Who are heroes of Battle of Aberdeen?|work=oneindia.com|date=17 May 2007}} < /ref > < ref name= \" Andaman Sheekha \" > {{cite web|url=http://www.andamansheekha.com/2012/05/16/tribute-at-the-memorial-of-battle-of-aberdeen-today/|title=Tribute at the Memorial of  \" Battle of Aberdeen \"  Today|author =sanjib|work=andamansheekha.com|date=15 May 2012}} < /ref > \n \n In 1867, the ship ''Nineveh'' wrecked on the reef of North Sentinel Island.

Major commercial timber species are Gurjan (''[[Dipterocarpus]]'' spp.) and [[Padauk]] (''[[Pterocarpus dalbergioides]]''). The following ornamental woods are noted for their pronounced grain formation: \n * Marble wood (''[[Diospyros|Diospyros marmorata]]'') \n * Padauk (''[[Pterocarpus dalbergioides]]'') \n * Silver grey (a special formation of wood in white [[utkarsh]]) \n * Chooi (''[[Sageraea|Sageraea elliptica]]'') \n * Kokko (''[[Albizzia lebbeck]]'') \n \n Padauk wood is sturdier than teak and is widely used for furniture making. \n \n There are [[burr wood]] and [[buttress root]] formations in Andaman Padauk. The largest piece of buttress known from Andaman was a dining table of {{convert|13|x|7|ft|abbr=on}}. The largest piece of burr wood was again a dining table for eight. \n \n The [[Rudraksha]] (''Elaeocarps sphaericus'') and aromatic Dhoop-resin trees also are found here. \n \n ==Fauna== \n [[File:The Coral Reef at the Andaman Islands.jpg|thumb|The coral reef at Havelock in Andaman]] \n \n The Andaman Islands are home to a number of animals, many of them endemic.

The species uses the ocean as a means of travel between different rivers and estuaries, thus they are not as commonly observed in open ocean. It is best to avoid swimming near mangrove areas or the mouths of creeks; swimming in the open ocean should be safe, but it is best to have a spotter around. \n \n ==Religion== \n Most of the tribal people in Andaman and Nicobar Islands believe in a religion that can be described as a form of [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Animism]].

When they first came into sustained contact with outside groups in the 1850s, there were an estimated 7,000 Andamanese, divided into the [[Great Andamanese]], [[Jarawa (Andaman Islands)|Jarawa]], [[Jangil]] (or ''Rutland Jarawa''), [[Onge people|Onge]], and the [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]]. The Great Andamanese formed 10 tribes of 5,000 people total. \n \n As the numbers of settlers from the mainland increased (at first mostly prisoners and involuntary [[indentured labour]]ers, later purposely recruited farmers), these indigenous people lost territory and numbers in the face of punitive expeditions by British troops, land encroachment and various epidemic diseases. \n \n Presently, there remain only approximately 400\u2013450 indigenous Andamanese.

The Andaman Islands form a single administrative district within the Union Territory, the [[Andaman district]] (the Nicobar Islands were separated and established as the new [[Nicobar district]] in 1974). \n \n ==Cultural references== \n The islands are prominently featured in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] 1890 mystery ''[[The Sign of the Four]].'' The magistrate in [[Lady Gregory]]'s play ''[[Spreading the News]]'' had formerly served in the islands. \n \n [[M. M. Kaye]]'s 1985 novel ''Death in the Andamans'' and [[Marianne Wiggins]]' 1989 novel ''John Dollar'' are set in the islands. The latter begins with an expedition from Burma to celebrate King George's birthday, but turns into a grim survival story after an earthquake and tsunami. [[Priyadarshan]]'s 1996 film ''[[Kaalapani (1996 film)|Kaalapani]]'' (Malayalam; ''[[Sirai Chaalai]]'' in Tamil) depicts the Indian freedom struggle and the lives of prisoners in the [[Cellular Jail]] in Port Blair. ''Island's End'' is a 2011 novel by [[Padma Venkatraman]] about the training of an indigenous shaman. A principal character in the novel ''[[Six Suspects (novel)|Six Suspects]]'' by [[Vikas Swarup]] is from the Andaman Islands. \n \n Brodie Moncur, the main protagonist of [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd's]] 2018 novel ''Love is Blind'', spends time in the Andaman Islands in the early years of the 20th century. \n \n ==Transportation== \n The only commercial airport is [[Veer Savarkar International Airport]] in [[Port Blair]], which has scheduled services to [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[New Delhi]], [[Bengaluru]] and [[Visakhapatnam]]. The airport is under the control of the [[Indian Navy]].
