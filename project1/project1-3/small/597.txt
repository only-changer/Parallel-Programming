However, it was based on erroneous, unscientific observations about the nature of reality.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=8}} Stringer notes that his reading of ''Primitive Culture'' led him to believe that Tylor was far more sympathetic in regard to  \" primitive \"  populations than many of his contemporaries and that Tylor expressed no belief that there was any difference between the intellectual capabilities of  \" savage \"  people and Westerners. < ref name=stringer/ > \n \n The idea that there had once been  \" one universal form of primitive religion \"  (whether labeled ''animism'', ''totemism'', or ''shamanism'') has been dismissed as  \" unsophisticated \"  and  \" erroneous \"  by archaeologist [[Timothy Insoll]], who stated that  \" it removes complexity, a precondition of religion now, in ''all'' its variants \" .{{sfn|Insoll|2004|p=29}} \n \n ===Social evolutionist conceptions=== \n Tylor's definition of animism was part of a growing international debate on the nature of  \" primitive society \"  by lawyers, theologians, and philologists. The debate defined the field of research of a new science: ''[[anthropology]]''. By the end of the 19th century, an orthodoxy on  \" primitive society \"  had emerged, but few anthropologists still would accept that definition. The  \" 19th-century armchair anthropologists \"  argued,  \" primitive society \"  (an evolutionary category) was ordered by kinship and divided into exogamous [[kinship|descent groups]] related by a series of marriage exchanges. Their religion was animism, the belief that natural species and objects had souls. \n \n With the development of private property, the descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of  \" developed \"  religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced a society became, the fewer members of that society believed in animism. However, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented  \" survivals \"  of the original animism of early humanity. < ref > {{cite book |last=Kuper |first=Adam |title=The Invention of Primitive Society: Transformations of an illusion |year=1988 |publisher=Routledge  &  Kegan Paul |location=London |pages=6\u20137}} < /ref > \n \n {{quote box \n | quote = The term [ \" animism \" ] clearly began as an expression of a nest of insulting approaches to indigenous peoples and the earliest putatively religious humans.

Certain indigenous religious groups such as the [[Australian Aboriginals]] are more typically totemic in their worldview, whereas others like the [[Inuit]] are more typically animistic. < ref > Ingold, Tim. 2000.  \" Totemism, Animism, and the Depiction of Animals. \"  In ''The Perception of the Environment: Essays on Livelihood, Dwelling and Skill''.

He argued that both humans and other animal species view inanimate objects as potentially alive as a means of being constantly on guard against potential threats.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=15}} His suggested explanation, however, did not deal with the question of why such a belief became central to the religion.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=16}} In 2000, Guthrie suggested that the  \" most widespread \"  concept of animism was that it was the  \" attribution of spirits to natural phenomena such as stones and trees \" .{{sfn|Guthrie|2000|p=106}} \n \n == \" New animism \"  non-archaic definitions == \n Many anthropologists ceased using the term ''animism'', deeming it to be too close to early anthropological theory and religious [[polemic]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} However, the term had also been claimed by religious groups\u2014namely indigenous communities and [[nature worship]]ers\u2014who felt that it aptly described their own beliefs, and who in some cases actively identified as  \" animists \" .{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=xii, 3}} It was thus readopted by various scholars, who began using the term in a different way,{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} placing the focus on knowing how to behave toward other beings, some of whom are not human.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} As religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated, while the  \" old animist \"  definition had been problematic, the term ''animism'' was nevertheless  \" of considerable value as a critical, academic term for a style of religious and cultural relating to the world. \" {{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xv}} \n \n ===Hallowell and the Ojibwe=== \n [[File:Hombres ojibwe.jpg|thumb|Five [[Ojibwe]] chiefs in the 19th century; it was anthropological studies of Ojibwe religion that resulted in the development of the  \" new animism \" .]] \n The ''new animism'' emerged largely from the publications of anthropologist [[Alfred Irving Hallowell|Irving Hallowell]], produced on the basis of his ethnographic research among the [[Ojibwe]] communities of Canada in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=17}} For the Ojibwe encountered by Hallowell, ''[[personhood]]'' did not require human-likeness, but rather humans were perceived as being like other persons, who for instance included rock persons and bear persons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} For the Ojibwe, these persons were each wilful beings who gained meaning and power through their interactions with others; through respectfully interacting with other persons, they themselves learned to  \" act as a person \" .{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} \n \n Hallowell's approach to the understanding of Ojibwe personhood differed strongly from prior anthropological concepts of animism.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=19}} He emphasized the need to challenge the modernist, Western perspectives of what a person is by entering into a dialogue with different worldwide-views.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} Hallowell's approach influenced the work of anthropologist [[Nurit Bird-David]], who produced a [[Academic journal#Scholarly articles|scholarly article]] reassessing the idea of animism in 1999.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=20}} Seven comments from other academics were provided in the journal, debating Bird-David's ideas.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=21}} \n \n ===Postmodern anthropology=== \n More recently,{{When|date=April 2021}} postmodern anthropologists are increasingly engaging with the concept of animism. Modernism is characterized by a [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] [[Cartesian dualism|subject-object dualism]] that divides the subjective from the objective, and culture from nature. In the modernist view, animism is the inverse of [[scientism]], and hence is deemed inherently invalid by some anthropologists. Drawing on the work of [[Bruno Latour]], some anthropologists question modernist assumptions and theorize that all societies continue to  \" animate \"  the world around them. In contrast to Tylor's reasoning, however, this  \" animism \"  is considered to be more than just a remnant of primitive thought. More specifically, the  \" animism \"  of modernity is characterized by humanity's  \" professional subcultures \" , as in the ability to treat the world as a detached entity within a delimited sphere of activity. \n \n Human beings continue to create personal relationships with elements of the aforementioned objective world, such as pets, cars, or teddy-bears, which are recognized as subjects. As such, these entities are  \" approached as communicative subjects rather than the inert objects perceived by modernists \" . < ref > {{cite journal |last=Hornborg |first=Alf |s2cid=143991508 |title=Animism, fetishism, and objectivism as strategies for knowing (or not knowing) the world |journal=Ethnos |year=2006 |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=22\u20134 |doi=10.1080/00141840600603129}} < /ref >  These approaches aim to avoid the modernist assumption that the environment consists of a physical world distinct from the world of humans, as well as the modernist conception of the person being composed dualistically from a body and a soul. < ref name= \" Bird-David 1999 S68 \" / > \n \n [[Nurit Bird-David]] argues that: < ref name= \" Bird-David 1999 S68 \"  / > \n \n {{Blockquote|text=Positivistic ideas about the meaning of 'nature', 'life' and 'personhood' misdirected these previous attempts to understand the local concepts.

That is, self-identity among animists is based on their relationships with others, rather than any distinctive features of the  \" self \" . Instead of focusing on the essentialized, modernist self (the  \" individual \" ), persons are viewed as bundles of social relationships ( \" dividuals \" ), some of which include  \" superpersons \"  (i.e. non-humans). \n \n [[File:Autel animiste.

In his books ''The Spell of the Sensuous'' and ''Becoming Animal,'' Abram suggests that material things are never entirely passive in our direct perceptual experience, holding rather that perceived things actively  \" solicit our attention \"  or  \" call our focus \" , coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / > < ref name= \" :1 \"  / > \n \n In the absence of intervening technologies, he suggests, [[sensory experience]] is inherently animistic in that it discloses a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the beginning. Drawing upon contemporary [[Cognitive science|cognitive]] and [[natural science]], as well as upon the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralist]] and story-based cosmology in which matter is alive. He suggests that such a relational [[ontology]] is in close accord with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it would draw us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain, enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters, and weather-patterns that materially sustains us. < ref name= \" :0 \" > Abram, David.

''Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology''. Vintage. {{ISBN|978-0-375-71369-9}}. < /ref > \n \n In contrast to a long-standing tendency in the Western social sciences, which commonly provide rational explanations of animistic experience, Abram develops an animistic account of reason itself. He holds that civilized reason is sustained only by intensely animistic participation between human beings and their own written signs. For instance, as soon as we turn our gaze toward the alphabetic letters written on a page or a screen, we  \" see what they say \" \u2014the letters, that is, seem to speak to us\u2014much as spiders, trees, gushing rivers and lichen-encrusted boulders once spoke to our oral ancestors. For Abram, reading can usefully be understood as an intensely concentrated form of animism, one that effectively eclipses all of the other, older, more spontaneous forms of animistic participation in which we once engaged. \n \n {{blockquote|To tell the story in this manner\u2014to provide an animistic account of reason, rather than the other way around\u2014is to imply that animism is the wider and more inclusive term and that oral, mimetic modes of experience still underlie, and support, all our literate and technological modes of reflection. When reflection's rootedness in such bodily, participatory modes of experience is entirely unacknowledged or unconscious, reflective reason becomes dysfunctional, unintentionally destroying the corporeal, sensuous world that sustains it. < ref > {{cite book |last=Abram |first=David |title=The Spell of the Sensuous |url=https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0|url-access=registration |year=1996 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0/page/303 303]}} < /ref > }} \n \n ===Relation to the concept of 'I-thou'=== \n Religious studies scholar Graham Harvey defined ''animism'' as the belief  \" that the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human, and that life is always lived in relationship with others \" .{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} He added that it is therefore  \" concerned with learning how to be a good person in respectful relationships with other persons \" .{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} \n \n In his ''Handbook of Contemporary Animism'' (2013), Harvey identifies the animist perspective in line with [[Martin Buber]]'s  \" [[I and Thou|I-thou]] \"  as opposed to  \" I-it \" .

[[Oxford University Press]] and [[Dictionary.com]]. Retrieved 25 July 2020. < /ref > \n \n According to [[Mircea Eliade]], shamanism encompasses the premise that shamans are intermediaries or messengers between the human world and the spirit worlds. Shamans are said to treat ailments and illnesses by mending the soul. Alleviating traumas affecting the soul or spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness. The shaman also enters [[otherworld|supernatural realms]] or [[Plane (esotericism)|dimensions]] to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community. Shamans may visit other worlds or dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements. The shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world, which in turn affects the human world. The restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment. < ref name= \" Eli72 \" > [[Mircea Eliade|Eliadem Mircea]]. 1972. ''[[Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy]]'', Bollingen Series LXXVI. Princeton University Press. pp. 3\u20137. < /ref > \n \n Abram, however, articulates a less supernatural and much more ecological understanding of the shaman's role than that propounded by Eliade. Drawing upon his own field research in Indonesia, Nepal, and the Americas, Abram suggests that in animistic cultures, the shaman functions primarily as an intermediary between the human community and the more-than-human community of active agencies\u2014the local animals, plants, and landforms (mountains, rivers, forests, winds, and weather patterns, all of which are felt to have their own specific [[sentience]]). Hence, the shaman's ability to heal individual instances of dis-ease (or imbalance) within the human community is a by-product of their more continual practice of balancing the reciprocity between the human community and the wider collective of animate beings in which that community is embedded. < ref > {{cite book |last=Abram |first=David |title=The Spell of the Sensuous |url=https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0 |url-access=registration |year=1996 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/spellofsensuousp00abra_0/page/3 3\u201329]}} < /ref > \n \n === Christian animism === \n {{Main|Christian animism}} \n Christian animism is a [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentric]] approach that understands God being present in all earthly objects, such as animals, trees, and rocks. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2020-10-15|title=Theologian Mark Wallace Explores Christian Animism in Recent Book|url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/news-events/theologian-mark-wallace-explores-christian-animism-recent-book|access-date=2020-12-08|website=www.swarthmore.edu|language=en}} < /ref >  Scholars of Christian animism include [[Mark I.

One of the main differences is that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united ([[monism]]), the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits or souls. < ref > [[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Harrison, Paul A.]] 2004.

The assembled participants called out {{Lang|mic|kitpu}} ('eagle'), conveying welcome to the bird and expressing pleasure at its beauty, and they later articulated the view that the eagle's actions reflected its approval of the event and the Mi'kmaq's return to traditional spiritual practices.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=102\u2013103}} \n \n === Flora === \n Some animists also view plant and fungi life as persons and interact with them accordingly.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=104}} The most common encounter between humans and these plant and fungi persons is with the former's collection of the latter for food, and for animists, this interaction typically has to be carried out respectfully.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=106}} Harvey cited the example of Maori communities in New Zealand, who often offer ''[[karakia]]'' invocations to [[sweet potatoes]] as they dig the latter up; while doing so there is an awareness of a kinship relationship between the Maori and the sweet potatoes, with both understood as having arrived in [[Aotearoa]] together in the same canoes.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=106}} \n \n In other instances, animists believe that interaction with plant and fungi persons can result in the communication of things unknown or even otherwise unknowable.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=104}} Among some modern Pagans, for instance, relationships are cultivated with specific trees, who are understood to bestow knowledge or physical gifts, such as flowers, sap, or wood that can be used as firewood or to fashion into a [[wand]]; in return, these Pagans give offerings to the tree itself, which can come in the form of [[libation]]s of mead or ale, a drop of blood from a finger, or a strand of wool.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=104\u2013105}} \n \n === The elements === \n Various animistic cultures also comprehend stones as persons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=106\u2013107}} Discussing ethnographic work conducted among the Ojibwe, Harvey noted that their society generally conceived of stones as being inanimate, but with two notable exceptions: the stones of the [[Bell Rocks]] and those stones which are situated beneath trees struck by lightning, which were understood to have become Thunderers themselves.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=107}} The Ojibwe conceived of weather as being capable of having personhood, with storms being conceived of as persons known as 'Thunderers' whose sounds conveyed communications and who engaged in seasonal conflict over the lakes and forests, throwing lightning at lake monsters.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=107}} Wind, similarly, can be conceived as a person in animistic thought.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=108\u2013109}} \n \n The importance of place is also a recurring element of animism, with some places being understood to be persons in their own right.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=109}} \n \n === Spirits === \n \n Animism can also entail relationships being established with non-corporeal spirit entities.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=122}} \n \n == Other usage == \n \n === Science === \n In the early 20th century, [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] defended a form of animism in his book ''Body and Mind: A History and Defence of Animism'' (1911). \n \n Physicist [[Nick Herbert (physicist)|Nick Herbert]] has argued for  \" quantum animism \"  in which the mind permeates the world at every level: \n \n {{quote|The quantum consciousness assumption, which amounts to a kind of  \" quantum animism \"  likewise asserts that consciousness is an integral part of the physical world, not an emergent property of special biological or computational systems. Since everything in the world is on some level a quantum system, this assumption requires that everything be conscious on that level.

Human reason (and its rigorous extension in the natural sciences) fits an evolutionary niche just as [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] does for bats and [[infrared vision]] does for pit vipers, and is\u2014according to western science's own dictates\u2014epistemologically on par with, rather than superior to, such capabilities. The meaning or aliveness of the  \" objects \"  we encounter\u2014rocks, trees, rivers, other animals\u2014thus depends its validity not on a detached cognitive judgment, but purely on the quality of our experience. The animist experience, and the wolf's or raven's experience, thus become licensed as equally valid worldviews to the modern western scientific one; they are more valid, since they are not plagued with the incoherence that inevitably crops up{{colloquialism|date=April 2021}} when  \" objective existence \"  is separated from  \" subjective experience \" . \n \n === Socio-political impact === \n \n Harvey opined that animism's views on personhood represented a radical challenge to the dominant perspectives of [[modernity]], because it accords  \" intelligence, rationality, consciousness, volition, agency, intentionality, language, and desire \"  to non-humans.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xviii}} Similarly, it challenges the view of human uniqueness that is prevalent in both [[Abrahamic religion]]s and Western [[rationalism]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xix}} \n \n === Art and literature === \n Animist beliefs can also be expressed through artwork.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=50}} For instance, among the [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] communities of New Zealand, there is an acknowledgement that creating art through carving wood or stone entails violence against the wood or stone person and that the persons who are damaged therefore have to be placated and respected during the process; any excess or waste from the creation of the artwork is returned to the land, while the artwork itself is treated with particular respect.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=55}} Harvey, therefore, argued that the creation of art among the Maori was not about creating an inanimate object for display, but rather a transformation of different persons within a relationship.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}} \n \n Harvey expressed the view that animist worldviews were present in various works of literature, citing such examples as the writings of [[Alan Garner]], [[Leslie Silko]], [[Barbara Kingsolver]], [[Alice Walker]], [[Daniel Quinn]], [[Linda Hogan]], [[David Abram]], [[Patricia Grace]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Ursula Le Guin]], [[Louise Erdrich]], and [[Marge Piercy]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xxiii}} \n \n Animist worldviews have also been identified in the animated films of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/spirits-gods-and-pastel-paints-the-weird-world-of-master-animator-hayao-miyazaki-1880974.html|title=Spirits, gods and pastel paints: The weird world of master animator Hayao Miyazaki|author=Robert Epstein|date=31 January 2010|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=1 June 2018}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=https://kyotojournal.org/the-journal/culture-arts/musings-on-miyazaki-early-and-late-2/|title=Musings on Miyazaki|author=Dr. David A.
