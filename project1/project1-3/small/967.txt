The ASF was formed from a group of developers of the [[Apache HTTP Server]], and incorporated on March 25, 1999. < ref name=incorporation > \n {{cite web |first=Roy T. |last=Fielding |title=Certificate of Incorporation of the Apache Software Foundation |url=https://www.apache.org/foundation/records/certificate.html |access-date=May 26, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531160220/http://apache.org/foundation/records/certificate.html |archive-date=May 31, 2009  |url-status=live}} \n < /ref > < ref name=effDate > {{cite web |first=Jim |last=Jagielski |title=The Apache Software Foundation Board of Directors Meeting Minutes 01 June 1999 |url=https://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/1999/board_minutes_1999_06_01.txt |access-date=May 26, 2009}} < /ref > \n \n The Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized open source community of developers. The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the [[Apache License]] and is [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS). The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license. Each project is managed by a self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project. The ASF is a [[meritocracy]], implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects. The ASF is considered a second generation [[Open-source software|open-source]] organization,{{Cn|date=April 2021}} in that commercial support is provided without the risk of [[platform lock-in]]. \n \n Among the ASF's objectives are: to provide legal protection to volunteers working on Apache projects; to prevent the ''Apache'' brand name from being used by other organizations without permission. \n \n The ASF also holds several [[ApacheCon]] conferences each year, highlighting Apache projects and related technology. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.apachecon.com/ |title=apachecon.com |publisher=apachecon.com |access-date=June 26, 2014}} < /ref > \n \n ==History== \n The history of the Apache Software Foundation is linked to the Apache HTTP Server, development beginning in February 1993. A group of eight developers started working on enhancing the [[NCSA HTTPd]] [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]]. They came to be known as the Apache Group. On March 25, 1999, the Apache Software Foundation was formed. < ref name=incorporation/ >  The first official meeting of the Apache Software Foundation was held on April 13, 1999. < ref name= \" :1 \"  / >  The initial members of the Apache Software Foundation consisted of the Apache Group: [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Ken Coar]], Miguel Gonzales, Mark Cox, [[Lars Eilebrecht]], Ralf S.
