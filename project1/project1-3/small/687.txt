The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions (and fortune) of a wealthy widow.

It is an imaginative, irreverent, and amusing work that relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, who introduces himself as related to the famous philosophers [[Plutarch]] and [[Sextus of Chaeronea]]. Lucius experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into an [[donkey|ass]]. In this guise he hears and sees many unusual things, until escaping from his predicament in a rather unexpected way. Within this [[frame story]] are found many [[story within a story|digressions]], the longest among them being the well-known tale of [[Cupid and Psyche]]. This story is a rare instance of a fairy tale preserved in an ancient literary text. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / > \n \n The ''Metamorphoses'' ends with the (once again human) hero, Lucius, eager to be initiated into the [[mysteries of Isis|mystery cult of Isis]]; he abstains from forbidden foods, bathes, and purifies himself. He is introduced to the ''[[Navigium Isidis]]''. Then the secrets of the cult's books are explained to him, and further secrets are revealed before he goes through the process of initiation, which involves a trial by the elements in a journey to the underworld. Lucius is then asked to seek initiation into the cult of [[Osiris]] in Rome, and eventually is initiated into the ''pastophoroi'' & nbsp;\u2013 a group of priests that serves Isis and Osiris. < ref > {{citation |last=Iles Johnson |first=Sarah |chapter=Mysteries |title=Ancient Religions |pages=104\u20135 |publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-674-02548-6}} < /ref > \n \n === The Apologia === \n Apologia (''Apulei Platonici pro Se de Magia'') is the version of the defense presented in [[Sabratha]], in 158\u2013159, before the proconsul [[Claudius Maximus]], by Apuleius accused of the crime of magic. Between the traditional exordium and peroratio, the argumentation is divided into three sections: \n # Refutation of the accusations leveled against his private life. He demonstrates that by marrying Pudentilla he had no interested motive and that he carries it away, intellectually and morally, on his opponents. \n # Attempt to prove that his so-called  \" magical operations \"  were in fact indispensable scientific experiments for an imitator of Aristotle and Hippocrates, or the religious acts of a Roman Platonist. \n # A recount of the events that have occurred in Oea since his arrival and pulverize the arguments against him. \n The main interest of the Apology is historical, as he offers substantial information about its author, magic and life in Africa in the second century. < ref > {{Cite encyclopedia |year=1989 |title=Apul\u00e9e |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e9die berb\u00e8re]] |publisher=Edisud |url=http://journals.openedition.org/encyclopedieberbere/2565 |last=C\u00e8be |first=Jean-Pierre |location=Aix-en-Provence |volume=6 {{!}} Antilopes \u2013 Arzuges |pages=820\u2013827}} < /ref > \n \n === Other works === \n His other works are: \n * ''Florida''.
