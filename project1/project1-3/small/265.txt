This name was itself brought from the [[Arabic]] word ''al-k\u012bmiy\u0101'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0643\u064a\u0645\u064a\u0627\u0621}} or {{rtl-lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0645\u064a\u0627\u0621}}) composed of two parts: the [[Late Greek]] term ''kh\u0113me\u00eda'' (\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03b1), also spelled ''khumeia'' (\u03c7\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03b1) and ''kh\u0113m\u00eda'' (\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03af\u03b1) - see below, and the Arabic [[definite article]] ''[[al-]]''  ({{rtl-lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0640}}), meaning 'The'. < ref name= \" OED \" > {{OED|alchemy}}. < /ref >  Together this association can be interpreted as 'the process of [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|transmutation]] by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form'. Several etymologies have been proposed for the Greek term. The first was proposed by Zosimos of Panopolis (3rd\u20134th centuries), who derived it from the name of a book, the ''Khemeu.'' < ref > George Syncellus, ''Chronography'', 18\u20139 < /ref > < ref > On the ancient definitions of alchemy in ancient Greek and Syriac texts see Matteo Martelli. 2014.  \" The Alchemical Art of Dyeing: The Fourfold Division of Alchemy and the Enochian Tradition \" , In: Dupr\u00e9 S.

This Coptic word derives from [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] ''km\u1ec9'', itself from ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''kmt''. The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour  \" black \"  (Egypt was the  \" Black Land \" , by contrast with the  \" Red Land \" , the surrounding desert); so this etymology could also explain the nickname  \" Egyptian black arts \" . \n \n == History == \n Alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents. These traditions' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and  \" genetic \"  relationships. One can distinguish at least three major strands, which appear to be mostly independent, at least in their earlier stages: [[Chinese alchemy]], centered in China and [[Rasayana|Indian alchemy]], centered on the [[Indian subcontinent]]; and Western alchemy, which occurred around the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and whose center has shifted over the millennia from [[Egypt (Roman province)|Greco-Roman Egypt]] to the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], and finally [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]]. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoism]] and Indian alchemy with the [[Indian religions|Dharmic faiths]]. In contrast, Western alchemy developed its philosophical system mostly independent of but influenced by various [[Western religion]]s. It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other. \n \n === Hellenistic Egypt === \n {{Hermeticism}} \n [[File:Zosimosapparat.jpg|thumb|300px|Ambix, cucurbit and retort of [[Zosimos of Panopolis|Zosimos]], from [[Marcelin Berthelot]], ''Collection des anciens alchimistes grecs'' (3 vol., Paris, 1887\u20131888).]] \n \n The start of Western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and [[Hellenistic Egypt]], where the city of [[Alexandria]]  was a center of alchemical knowledge, and retained its pre-eminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods. < ref > ''New Scientist'', 24\u201331 December 1987 < /ref >  Following the work of Andr\u00e9-Jean Festugi\u00e8re, modern scholars see alchemical practice in the Roman Empire as originating from the Egyptian goldsmith's art, Greek philosophy and different religious traditions. < ref > {{Cite book|last=Festugi\u00e8re|first=Andr\u00e9-Jean|title=La r\u00e9v\u00e9lation d'Herm\u00e8s Trism\u00e9giste, Vol.1|publisher=Les Belles Lettres|year=2006|location=Paris|pages=218\u2013219}} < /ref >  Tracing the origins of the alchemical art in Egypt is complicated by the [[pseudepigraphic]] nature of texts from the Greek alchemical corpus.

The early Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy. [[Plato]]nic and [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translations and scholarship. \n \n In the late ninth and early tenth centuries, the Arabic works attributed to [[J\u0101bir ibn Hayy\u0101n]] (Latinized as  \" Geber \"  or  \" Geberus \" ) introduced a new approach to alchemy. [[Paul Kraus (Arabist)|Paul Kraus]], who wrote the standard reference work on Jabir, put it as follows: \n \n {{quote|To form an idea of the historical place of Jabir's alchemy and to tackle the problem of its sources, it is advisable to compare it with what remains to us of the alchemical literature in the [[Greek language]]. One knows in which miserable state this literature reached us. Collected by [[Byzantine science|Byzantine scientists]] from the tenth century, the corpus of the Greek alchemists is a cluster of incoherent fragments, going back to all the times since the third century until the end of the Middle Ages. \n \n The efforts of Berthelot and Ruelle to put a little order in this mass of literature led only to poor results, and the later researchers, among them in particular Mrs. Hammer-Jensen, Tannery, Lagercrantz, von Lippmann, Reitzenstein, Ruska, Bidez, Festugi\u00e8re and others, could make clear only few points of detail .... \n \n The study of the Greek alchemists is not very encouraging. An even surface examination of the Greek texts shows that a very small part only was organized according to true experiments of laboratory: even the supposedly technical writings, in the state where we find them today, are unintelligible nonsense which refuses any interpretation. \n \n It is different with Jabir's alchemy. The relatively clear description of the processes and the alchemical apparati, the methodical classification of the substances, mark an experimental spirit which is extremely far away from the weird and odd esotericism of the Greek texts. The theory on which Jabir supports his operations is one of clearness and of an impressive unity. More than with the other Arab authors, one notes with him a balance between theoretical teaching and practical teaching, between the ''[[Ilm (Arabic)|'ilm]]'' and the ''amal''. In vain one would seek in the Greek texts a work as systematic as that which is presented, for example, in the ''Book of Seventy''. < ref name=Kraus > Kraus, Paul, J\u00e2bir ibn Hayy\u00e2n, ''Contribution \u00e0 l'histoire des id\u00e9es scientifiques dans l'Islam.

The most influential author in this regard was arguably Jabir. Jabir's ultimate goal was ''[[Takwin]]'', the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory, up to, and including, human life. He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of ''hotness'', ''coldness'', ''dryness'', and ''moistness''. < ref name=burckhardt29 / >  According to Jabir, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist. Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result. < ref name=burckhardt29 > {{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | author-link=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=29 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}} < /ref >  By this reasoning, the search for the [[philosopher's stone]] was introduced to Western alchemy. Jabir developed an elaborate [[numerology]] whereby the root letters of a substance's name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element's physical properties. \n \n The elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with Jabir. His original system consisted of seven elements, which included the five [[classical element]]s ([[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], and [[Water (classical element)|water]]) in addition to two [[chemical element]]s representing the metals: [[Sulfur|sulphur]],  \" the stone which burns \" , which characterized the principle of combustibility, and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties.{{dubious|date=January 2021}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} Shortly thereafter, this evolved into eight elements, with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles: sulphur giving flammability or combustion, mercury giving volatility and stability, and [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] giving solidity. < ref name= \" r8 \" > Strathern, Paul.

The philosopher's stone of European alchemists can be compared to the [[Elixir of life|Grand Elixir of Immortality]] sought by Chinese alchemists. However, in the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosopher's stone was often equated with the [[Panacea (medicine)|universal panacea]]; therefore, the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears. \n \n [[Black powder]] may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists. As previously stated above, [[China|Chinese]] alchemy was more related to medicine. It is said that the Chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a [[potion]] for eternal life.

The efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists. In the 13th century, [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Roger Bacon]] were the most notable of these, their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in Aristotelian terms. < ref > John Read. ''From Alchemy to Chemistry''. 1995 p.90 < /ref >  Albertus Magnus, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]], is known to have written works such as the ''Book of Minerals'' where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like Hermes and Democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time. Albertus critically compared these to the writings of Aristotle and Avicenna, where they concerned the transmutation of metals. From the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century, more than 28 alchemical tracts were misattributed to him, a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist. < ref > James A. Weisheipl. ''Albertus Magnus and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays.'' PIMS. 1980. p.187-202 < /ref >  Likewise, alchemical texts have been attributed to Albert's student [[Thomas Aquinas]]. \n \n Roger Bacon, a [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan friar]] who wrote on a wide variety of topics including [[optics]], [[comparative linguistics]], and medicine, composed his ''[[Opus Majus|Great Work]]'' ({{lang-la|Opus Majus}}) for {{nowrap|[[Pope Clement IV]]}} as part of a project towards rebuilding the [[medieval university]] curriculum to include the new learning of his time. While alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic, he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy's connections to [[soteriology]] and Christian theology. Bacon's writings integrated morality, salvation, alchemy, and the prolongation of life. His correspondence with Clement highlighted this, noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy. < ref > Edmund Brehm.  \" Roger Bacon's Place in the History of Alchemy. \"  ''Ambix.'' Vol. 23, Part I, March 1976. < /ref >  Like the Greeks before him, Bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres. He noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of Aristotle, the natural philosophers, and all Latin writers of his time. The practical, however, confirmed the theoretical thought experiment, and Bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine. < ref > {{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=120\u2013121}} < /ref >  In later European legend, however, Bacon became an archmage. In particular, along with Albertus Magnus, he was credited with the forging of a [[brazen head]] capable of answering its owner's questions. \n \n Soon after Bacon, the influential work of [[Pseudo-Geber]] (sometimes identified as [[Paul of Taranto]]) appeared. His ''Summa Perfectionis'' remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods. It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity with which they were described. < ref > {{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=134\u2013141}}. < /ref >  By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the [[soul|human soul]]). They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded [[jargon]] set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made [[observation]]s and [[theory|theories]] about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with God. < ref > {{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | author-link=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=149 | others=Trans.

There were important overlaps between practitioners, and trying to classify them into alchemists, chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic. For example, [[Tycho Brahe]] (1546\u20131601), an alchemist better known for his [[astronomical]] and [[astrological]] investigations, had a laboratory built at his [[Uraniborg]] observatory/research institute. [[Micha\u0142 S\u0119dziw\u00f3j|Michael Sendivogius]] (''Micha\u0142 S\u0119dziw\u00f3j'', 1566\u20131636), a [[Poland|Polish]] alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling [[oxygen]] in a lab sometime around 1600. Sendivogious taught his technique to [[Cornelius Drebbel]] who, in 1621, applied this in a submarine. [[Isaac Newton]] devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy (see [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]]) than he did to either optics or physics. Other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include [[Robert Boyle]], and [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]].

Since the Victorian revival of alchemy,  \" occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice, involving the self-transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances \" , < ref name= \" Alchemy Restored \"  / >  which has contributed to a merger of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and alchemy in popular thought. \n \n === Modern esoteric interpretations of historical texts=== \n In the eyes of a variety of modern [[Esotericism|esoteric]] and [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Neo-Hermeticist]] practitioners, alchemy is fundamentally spiritual. In this interpretation, transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation, purification, and perfection. < ref name= \" Antoine Faivre 1995. p.96 \" > Antoine Faivre, Wouter J. Hanegraaff. ''Western esotericism and the science of religion.'' 1995. p.96 < /ref > \n \n According to this view, early alchemists such as [[Zosimos of Panopolis]] (c. AD 300) highlighted the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest, symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul. < ref > Allen G. Debus. ''Alchemy and early modern chemistry.'' The Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry. p.34. < /ref >  This approach is held to have continued in the Middle Ages, as metaphysical aspects, substances, physical states, and material processes are supposed to have been used as metaphors for spiritual entities, spiritual states, and, ultimately, transformation. In this sense, the literal meanings of 'Alchemical Formulas' were like a veil, hiding their true [[spiritual philosophy]]. In the Neo-Hermeticist interpretation, both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea are held to symbolize evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible, and ephemeral state toward a perfect, healthy, incorruptible, and everlasting state, so the philosopher's stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are held to have been written according to this view, the cryptic [[alchemical symbol]]s, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works are supposed to contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; which must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning. \n \n In his 1766 ''Alchemical Catechism'', Th\u00e9odore Henri de Tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was merely symbolic: \n \n {{quote| < poem > Q.

Initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images, after being given a copy of the translation of ''The Secret of the Golden Flower'', a Chinese alchemical text, by his friend Richard Wilhelm, Jung discovered a direct correlation or parallels between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner, symbolic images coming up in dreams, visions or imaginations during the psychic processes of transformation occurring in his patients. A process, which he called  \" process of individuation \" . He regarded the alchemical images as symbols expressing aspects of this  \" process of [[individuation]] \"  of which the creation of the gold or lapis within were symbols for its origin and goal. < ref name= \" Jung, C.

The volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemy's popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites brought into contact and inner and outer, spirit and matter are reunited in the ''[[hieros gamos]]''  or divine marriage. His writings are influential in psychology and for persons who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams, symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces ([[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]) < ref name= \" Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson.

Jung wrote volumes on alchemy and his magnum opus is Volume 14 of his Collected Works, ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis]]''. \n \n === Literature === \n {{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}} \n Alchemy has had a long-standing relationship with art, seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment. ''Literary alchemy'' appears throughout the history of English literature from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] to [[J. K. Rowling]], and also the popular Japanese manga ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]''. Here, characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus. In the 14th century, Chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of the late Sir [[Terry Pratchett]]. \n \n Visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy. While some of them used alchemy as a source of satire, others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work. Music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers. In the last hundred years, alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction, film, television, novels, comics and video games. \n \n === Modern science === \n One goal of alchemy, the transmutation of base substances into gold, is now known to be impossible by chemical means but possible by physical means. Although not financially worthwhile, [[Synthesis of precious metals#Gold|Gold was synthesized]] in particle accelerators as early as 1941. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Aleklett|first1=K.|last2=Morrissey|first2=D.
