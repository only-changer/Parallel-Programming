Fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide a portrait of the man. \n \n Anaximander was an early proponent of [[science]] and tried to observe and explain different aspects of the universe, with a particular [[cosmogony|interest in its origins]], claiming that nature is ruled by laws, just like human societies, and anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last long. < ref > Park, David (2005) ''The Grand Contraption'', Princeton University Press {{ISBN|0-691-12133-8}} < /ref >  Like many thinkers of his time, Anaximander's [[philosophy]] included contributions to many disciplines. In [[astronomy]], he attempted to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the Earth. In physics, his postulation that the indefinite (or [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]) was the source of all things led Greek philosophy to a new level of conceptual abstraction. His knowledge of [[geometry]] allowed him to introduce the [[gnomon]] in Greece. He created a [[World map|map of the world]] that contributed greatly to the advancement of [[geography]]. He was also involved in the [[politics]] of Miletus and was sent as a leader to one of its colonies. \n \n ==Biography== \n [[Image:Anaximander.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Detail of [[Raphael]]'s painting ''[[The School of Athens]]'', 1510\u20131511.

[[Themistius]], a 4th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[rhetoric]]ian, mentions that he was the  \" first of the known Greeks to publish a written document on nature. \"  Therefore, his texts would be amongst the earliest written in [[prose]], at least in the Western world. By the time of [[Plato]], his philosophy was almost forgotten, and [[Aristotle]], his successor [[Theophrastus]] and a few [[Doxography|doxographers]] provide us with the little information that remains. However, we know from Aristotle that Thales, also from Miletus, precedes Anaximander. It is debatable whether Thales actually was the teacher of Anaximander, but there is no doubt that Anaximander was influenced by Thales' theory that everything is derived from water. One thing that is not debatable is that even the ancient Greeks considered Anaximander to be from the [[Monist]] school which began in Miletus, with Thales followed by Anaximander and which ended with [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]. < ref > Richard D. McKirahan, ''Philosophy before Socrates'', Ch 5, 32\u201334 < /ref >   3rd-century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rhetorician [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] depicts Anaximander as leader of the Milesian colony to [[Sozopol|Apollonia]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast, and hence some have inferred that he was a prominent citizen. < ref name= \" Chisholm1911 \" > {{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Anaximander|page=944}} < /ref >  Indeed, ''Various History'' (III, 17) explains that philosophers sometimes also dealt with political matters. It is very likely that leaders of Miletus sent him there as a legislator to create a constitution or simply to maintain the colony's allegiance. \n \n Anaximander lived the final few years of his life as a subject of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Achaemenid Empire]]. < ref > {{cite book|last1=Dandamaev|first1=M.

In his desire to find some universal principle, he assumed, like traditional religion, the existence of a cosmic order; and  his ideas on this used the old  language of myths which ascribed divine control to various spheres of reality. This was a common practice for the Greek philosophers in a society which saw gods everywhere, and therefore could fit their ideas into a tolerably elastic system. < ref > C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World publishing Company. Cleveland and New York. p168,169. < /ref > \n \n Some scholars see a gap between the existing mythical and the new [[rationalism|rational]] way of thought which is the main characteristic of the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]] (8th to 6th century BC) in the Greek [[city-state]]s. < ref > [[Herbert Ernest Cushman]] claims Anaximander has  \" the first European philosophical conception of god \" , ''A beginner's history of philosophy'', Volume 1 pg. 24 < /ref >  This has given rise to the phrase  \" Greek miracle \" . But if we follow carefully the course of Anaximander's ideas, we will notice that there was not such an abrupt break as initially appears. The basic elements of nature ([[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]]) which the first Greek philosophers believed made up the universe  in fact represent  the primordial forces imagined in earlier ways of thinking. Their collision produced what the mythical tradition had called cosmic harmony. In the old cosmogonies & nbsp;\u2013 [[Hesiod]] (8th & nbsp;\u2013 7th century & nbsp;BC) and [[Pherecydes of Syros|Pherecydes]] (6th century BC) & nbsp;\u2013 [[Zeus]] establishes his order in the world by destroying the powers which were threatening this harmony (the [[Titans (mythology)|Titans]]). Anaximander claimed that the cosmic order is not [[monarchic]] but [[geometric]], and that this causes the equilibrium of the earth, which is lying in the centre of the universe. This is the projection on nature of a new political order and a new space organized around a centre which is the static point of the system in the society as in nature. < ref > C. Mosse (1984) ''La Grece archaique d'Homere a Eschyle''. Edition du Seuil. p 235 < /ref >  In this space there is ''isonomy'' (equal rights) and all the forces are symmetrical and transferable.

Consequently, deciding where they start and where they end is often difficult. However, it is generally accepted that this quote is not Simplicius' own interpretation, {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  but Anaximander's writing, in  \" somewhat poetic terms \"  as it is mentioned by Simplicius. < /ref > < ref > Curd, Patricia, ''A Presocratics Reader: Selected Fragments and Testimonia'' ([[Hackett Publishing]], 1996), p. 12. < /ref > \n \n < blockquote > \n Whence things have their origin, < br / > \n Thence also their destruction happens, < br / > \n According to necessity; < br / > \n For they give to each other justice and recompense < br / > \n For their injustice < br / > \n In conformity with the ordinance of Time. \n < /blockquote > \n \n Simplicius mentions that Anaximander said all these  \" in poetic terms \" , meaning that he used the old mythical language. The goddess Justice ([[Dike (mythology)|Dike]]) keeps the cosmic order. This concept of returning to the element of origin was often revisited afterwards, notably by Aristotle, < ref > Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', I, 3, 983 ''b'' 8\u201311; ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', III, 5, 204 ''b'' 33\u201334 < /ref >  and by the Greek [[Tragedy|tragedian]] [[Euripides]]:  \" what comes from earth must return to earth. \" < ref > Euripides''[[The Suppliants (Euripides)|Supplices]]'', v. 532 < /ref >   [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in his ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', stated that Anaximander viewed  \" ... all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance. \" < ref > [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'' (1873) \u00a7 4. < /ref >  Physicist [[Max Born]], in commenting upon [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s arriving at the idea that the elementary particles of [[quantum mechanics]] are to be seen as different manifestations, different quantum states, of one and the same \u201cprimordial substance,\u201d' proposed that this primordial substance be called ''apeiron''. < ref > {{cite web |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Bmcpsgp-Ml4C & pg=PA546 |title=A Cultural History of Physics |last=K\u00e1roly |first= Simonyi |author-link= Simonyi K\u00e1roly |date= April 7, 2012 |work=Chapter 5.5.10 Back to the Apeiron? |publisher= CRC Press |access-date=July 9, 2013}} < /ref > \n \n ===Cosmology=== \n [[File:Anaximander cosmology-en.svg|thumb|left|280px|Map of Anaximander's universe]] \n \n Anaximander's bold use of non-[[Greek mythology|mythological]] explanatory hypotheses considerably distinguishes him from previous cosmology writers such as [[Hesiod]]. It confirms that pre-Socratic philosophers were making an early effort to demystify physical processes. His major contribution to history was writing the oldest prose document about the [[Universe]] and the origins of [[life]]; for this he is often called the  \" Father of [[Cosmology]] \"  and founder of astronomy. However, [[pseudo-Plutarch]] states that he still viewed celestial bodies as deities. < ref > Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Doctrines of the Philosophers'', i. 7 < /ref > \n \n Anaximander was the first to conceive a [[Mechanics|mechanical]] model of the [[world]]. In his model, the [[Earth]] floats very still in the centre of the infinite, not supported by anything. It remains  \" in the same place because of its indifference \" , a point of view that Aristotle considered ingenious, but false, in ''[[On the Heavens]]''. < ref > Aristotle, ''On the Heavens'', ii, 13 < /ref >  Its curious shape is that of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] < ref > \" A column of stone \" , [[A\u00ebtius (theologian)|Aetius]] reports in ''De Fide'' (III, 7, 1), or  \" similar to a pillar-shaped stone \" , pseudo-Plutarch (III, 10). < /ref >  with a height one-third of its diameter. The flat top forms the inhabited world, which is surrounded by a circular oceanic mass. \n \n Anaximander's realization that the Earth floats free without falling and does not need to be resting on something has been indicated by many as the first cosmological revolution and the starting point of scientific thinking. < ref > Carlo Rovelli,  \" The First Scientist, Anaximander and his Legacy \"  (Yardley: Westholme, 2011). < /ref > < ref > Daniel W. Graham,  \" Explaining the Cosmos: The Ionian Tradition of Scientific Philosophy \"  (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006). < /ref >  [[Karl Popper]] calls this idea  \" one of the boldest, most revolutionary, and most portentous ideas in the whole history of human thinking. \" < ref > Karl Popper,  \" Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge \"  (New York: Routledge, 1998), pg 186. < /ref >   Such a model allowed the concept that [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]] could pass under the Earth, opening the way to Greek astronomy. \n \n [[File:Persectives of Anaximander's universe.png|thumb|right|350px|Illustration of Anaximander's models of the universe. On the left, daytime in summer; on the right, nighttime in winter. Note the sphere represents the combined rings of all of the stars about the very small inner cylinder which represents the Earth.]] \n \n At the origin, after the separation of [[Temperature|hot and cold]], a ball of flame appeared that surrounded Earth like bark on a tree. This ball broke apart to form the rest of the Universe. It resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels, filled with fire, with the rims pierced by holes like those of a flute. Consequently, the [[Sun]] was the fire that one could see through a hole the same size as the Earth on the farthest wheel, and an eclipse corresponded with the [[Occultation|occlusion]] of that hole. The diameter of the solar wheel was twenty-seven times that of the Earth (or twenty-eight, depending on the sources) < ref > In ''Refutation'', it is reported that the circle of the Sun is twenty-seven times bigger than the Moon. < /ref >  and the [[Moon|lunar]] wheel, whose fire was less intense, eighteen (or nineteen) times. Its hole could change shape, thus explaining [[lunar phase]]s. The [[star]]s and the [[planet]]s, located closer, < ref > Aetius, ''De Fide'' (II, 15, 6) < /ref >  followed the same model. < ref > Most of Anaximander's model of the Universe comes from pseudo-Plutarch (II, 20\u201328): \n \n :  \" [The Sun] is a circle twenty-eight times as big as the Earth, with the outline similar to that of a fire-filled chariot wheel, on which appears a mouth in certain places and through which it exposes its fire, as through the hole on a flute. [...] the Sun is equal to the Earth, but the circle on which it breathes and on which it's borne is twenty-seven times as big as the whole earth. [...] [The eclipse] is when the mouth from which comes the fire heat is closed. [...] [The Moon] is a circle nineteen times as big as the whole earth, all filled with fire, like that of the Sun \" . < /ref > \n \n Anaximander was the first astronomer to consider the Sun as a huge mass, and consequently, to realize how far from Earth it might be, and the first to present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances. Furthermore, according to Diogenes Laertius (II, 2), he built a [[celestial spheres|celestial sphere]]. This invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the [[Axial tilt|obliquity]] of the [[Zodiac]] as the Roman philosopher [[Pliny the Elder]] reports in ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (II, 8). It is a little early to use the term [[ecliptic]], but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the Earth to explain the seasons. The [[doxography|doxographer]] and theologian Aetius attributes to Pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity. \n \n ===Multiple worlds=== \n According to Simplicius, Anaximander already speculated on the [[Cosmic pluralism|plurality of worlds]], similar to [[atomism|atomists]] [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]], and later philosopher [[Epicurus]]. These thinkers supposed that worlds appeared and disappeared for a while, and that some were born when others perished. They claimed that this movement was eternal,  \" for without movement, there can be no generation, no destruction \" . < ref > Simplicius, ''Commentary on Aristotle's Physics'', 1121, 5\u20139 < /ref > \n \n In addition to Simplicius, Hippolytus < ref > Hippolytus (?), ''Refutation'' I, 6 < /ref >  reports Anaximander's claim that from the infinite comes the principle of beings, which themselves come from the heavens and the worlds (several doxographers use the plural when this philosopher is referring to the worlds within, < ref > Notably pseudo-Plutarch (III, 2) and Aetius, (I, 3, 3; I, 7, 12; II, 1, 3; II, 1, 8). < /ref >  which are often infinite in quantity). [[Cicero]] writes that he attributes different gods to the countless worlds. < ref > ''On the Nature of the Gods'' (I, 10, 25): \n \n : '' \" Anaximandri autem opinio est nativos esse deos longis intervallis orientis occidentisque, eosque innumerabiles esse mundos. \" '' \n :  \" For Anaximander, gods were born, but the time is long between their birth and their death; and the worlds are countless. \" < /ref > \n \n This theory places Anaximander close to the Atomists and the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] who, more than a century later, also claimed that an infinity of worlds appeared and disappeared. In the [[Timeline of Western philosophers#Classical philosophers|timeline of the Greek history of thought]], some thinkers conceptualized a single world (Plato, Aristotle, [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]]), while others instead speculated on the existence of a series of worlds, continuous or non-continuous ([[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Empedocles]] and [[Diogenes Apolloniates|Diogenes]]). \n \n ===Meteorological phenomena=== \n Anaximander attributed some phenomena, such as [[thunder]] and [[lightning]], to the intervention of elements, rather than to divine causes. < ref > Pseudo-Plutarch (III, 3): \n \n :  \" Anaximander claims that all this is done by the wind, for when it happens to be enclosed in a thick cloud, then by its subtlety and lightness, the rupture produces the sound; and the scattering, because of the darkness of the cloud, creates the light. \" < /ref >  In his system, thunder results from the shock of clouds hitting each other; the loudness of the sound is proportionate with that of the shock. Thunder without lightning is the result of the wind being too weak to emit any flame, but strong enough to produce a sound. A flash of lightning without thunder is a jolt of the air that disperses and falls, allowing a less active fire to break free. Thunderbolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air flow. < ref > According to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Naturales quaestiones'' (II, 18). < /ref > \n \n He saw the sea as a remnant of the mass of humidity that once surrounded Earth. < ref > Pseudo-Plutarch (III, 16) < /ref >  A part of that mass [[Evaporation|evaporated]] under the sun's action, thus causing the winds and even the rotation of the celestial bodies, which he believed were attracted to places where water is more abundant. < ref > It is then very likely that by observing the moon and the tides, Anaximander thought the latter were the cause, and not the effect of the satellite's movement. < /ref >  He explained rain as a product of the humidity pumped up from Earth by the sun. < ref name= \" Refutation \"  / >  For him, the Earth was slowly drying up and water only remained in the deepest regions, which someday would go dry as well. According to Aristotle's ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'' (II, 3), Democritus also shared this opinion. \n \n ===Origin of humankind=== \n Anaximander speculated about the beginnings and [[Evolution|origin]] of animal life, and that humans came from other animals in waters. < ref name= \" :0 \" > {{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/presocra/#SH2b|title=Presocratics|last=Graham|first=Jacob|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}} < /ref > < ref > Anaximander, frag. A30 < /ref >  According to his [[History of evolutionary thought|evolutionary theory]], animals sprang out of the sea long ago, born trapped in a spiny bark, but as they got older, the bark would dry up and animals would be able to break it. < ref > Aetius, Opinions, V, XIX, 4. < /ref >  As the early humidity evaporated, dry land emerged and, in time, humankind had to adapt.{{Dubious|date=December 2015}} The 3rd century Roman writer [[Censorinus]] reports: \n \n {{quote|text=Anaximander of Miletus considered that from warmed up water and earth emerged either fish or entirely fishlike animals. Inside these animals, men took form and embryos were held prisoners until puberty; only then, after these animals burst open, could men and women come out, now able to feed themselves. < ref > Censorinus, ''De Die Natali'', IV, 7 < /ref > |sign=|source=}} \n \n Anaximander put forward the idea that humans had to spend part of this transition inside the mouths of big fish to protect themselves from the Earth's climate until they could come out in open air and lose their scales. < ref > [[Plutarch]] also mentions Anaximander's theory that humans were born inside fish, feeding like sharks, and that when they could defend themselves, they were thrown ashore to live on dry land. < /ref >  He thought that, considering humans' extended infancy, we could not have survived in the primeval world in the same manner we do presently. \n \n ==Other accomplishments== \n \n ===Cartography=== \n [[File:Anaximander world map-en.svg|thumb|right|280px|Possible rendering of Anaximander's world map < ref > According to John Mansley Robinson, ''An Introduction to Early Greek Philosophy'', Houghton and Mifflin, 1968. < /ref > ]] \n \n Both [[Strabo]] and [[Agathemerus]] (later Greek geographers) claim that, according to the geographer [[Eratosthenes]], Anaximander was the first to publish a [[World map|map of the world]]. The map probably inspired the Greek historian [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] to draw a more accurate version. Strabo viewed both as the first geographers after [[Homer]]. \n \n Maps were produced in ancient times, also notably in [[Egypt]], [[Lydia]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Babylon]]. Only some small examples survived until today. The unique example of a world map comes from late Babylonian tablet [[Babylonian Map of the World|BM 92687]] later than 9th century BC but is based probably on a much older map. These maps indicated directions, roads, towns, borders, and geological features. Anaximander's innovation was to represent the entire inhabited land known to the ancient Greeks. \n \n Such an accomplishment is more significant than it at first appears. Anaximander most likely drew this map for three reasons. < ref > As established by Marcel Conche, ''Anaximandre. Fragments et t\u00e9moignages'', introduction (p. & nbsp;43\u201347). < /ref >  First, it could be used to improve navigation and trade between [[Miletus]]'s colonies and other colonies around the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Second, [[Thales]] would probably have found it easier to convince the Ionian [[Polis|city-states]] to join in a federation in order to push the [[Medes|Median]] threat away if he possessed such a tool. Finally, the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one. \n \n Surely aware of the sea's convexity, he may have designed his map on a slightly rounded metal surface. The centre or \u201cnavel\u201d of the world ({{lang|grc|\u1f40\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b3\u1fc6\u03c2}} ''omphal\u00f3s g\u1ebds'') could have been [[Delphi]], but is more likely in Anaximander's time to have been located near Miletus. The [[Aegean Sea]] was near the map's centre and enclosed by three continents, themselves located in the middle of the ocean and isolated like islands by sea and rivers. [[Europe]] was bordered on the south by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and was separated from [[Asia]] by the Black Sea, the [[Sea of Azov|Lake Maeotis]], and, further east, either by the [[Rioni River|Phasis River]] (now called the Rioni) or the [[Tanais]]. The [[Nile]] flowed south into the ocean, separating [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] (which was the name for the part of the then-known [[Africa]]n continent) from Asia. \n \n ===Gnomon=== \n The ''[[Suda]]'' relates that Anaximander explained some basic notions of geometry. It also mentions his interest in the measurement of time and associates him with the introduction in [[Greece]] of the gnomon. In [[Lacedaemon]], he participated in the construction, or at least in the adjustment, of [[sundial]]s to indicate [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es. < ref > These accomplishments are often attributed to him, notably by Diogenes Laertius (II, 1) and by the Roman historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Preparation for the Gospel]]'' (X, 14, 11). < /ref >  Indeed, a gnomon required adjustments from a place to another because of the difference in latitude. \n \n In his time, the gnomon was simply a vertical pillar or rod mounted on a horizontal plane. The position of its shadow on the plane indicated the time of day. As it moves through its apparent course, the Sun draws a curve with the tip of the projected shadow, which is shortest at noon, when pointing due south. The variation in the tip's position at noon indicates the solar time and the seasons; the shadow is longest on the winter solstice and shortest on the summer solstice. \n \n The invention of the gnomon itself cannot be attributed to Anaximander because its use, as well as the division of days into twelve parts, came from the [[Babylonia]]ns. It is they, according to [[Herodotus]]' [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] (II, 109), who gave the Greeks the art of time measurement. It is likely that he was not the first to determine the solstices, because no calculation is necessary. On the other hand, equinoxes do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during solstices, as the Babylonians thought. As the ''Suda'' seems to suggest, it is very likely that with his knowledge of geometry, he became the first Greek to accurately determine the equinoxes. \n \n ===Prediction of an earthquake=== \n In his philosophical work ''[[De Divinatione]]'' (I, 50, 112), Cicero states that Anaximander convinced the inhabitants of [[Lacedaemon]] to abandon their city and spend the night in the country with their weapons because an earthquake was near. < ref > [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/divinatione1.shtml ''Da Divinatione'' (in Latin)] < /ref >  The city collapsed when the top of the [[Taygetus]] split like the stern of a ship. Pliny the Elder also mentions this anecdote (II, 81), suggesting that it came from an  \" admirable inspiration \" , as opposed to Cicero, who did not associate the prediction with divination. \n \n ==Interpretations== \n [[Bertrand Russell]] in the ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'' interprets Anaximander's theories as  < !-- the above quote as | CLARIFY: probably due to editing, the quote referenced here is unclear. -- >  an assertion of the necessity of an appropriate balance between earth, fire, and water, all of which may be independently seeking to aggrandize their proportions relative to the others. Anaximander seems to express his belief that a natural order ensures balance between these elements, that where there was fire, ashes (earth) now exist. < ref > Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy and Its Connection with Political and Social Circumstances from the Earliest Times to the Present Day'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1946). < /ref >  His Greek peers echoed this sentiment with their belief in natural boundaries beyond which not even the gods could operate. \n \n [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist who asserted that the primal being of the world was a state of indefiniteness. In accordance with this, anything definite has to eventually pass back into indefiniteness. In other words, Anaximander viewed  \" ...all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance \" . (''Ibid.'', \u00a7 4) The world of individual objects, in this way of thinking, has no worth and should perish. < ref > Friedrich Nietzsche, ''Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks'' (Washington, D.C.: Regnery Gateway, 1962). < /ref > \n \n [[Martin Heidegger]] lectured extensively on Anaximander, and delivered a lecture entitled  \" Anaximander's Saying \"  which was subsequently included in ''Off the Beaten Track''. The lecture examines the ontological difference and the oblivion of Being or ''[[Dasein]]'' in the context of the Anaximander fragment. < ref > Martin Heidegger, ''Off the Beaten Track'' (Cambridge  &  New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002). < /ref >  Heidegger's lecture is, in turn, an important influence on the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]. < ref > Cf. Jacques Derrida, ''Margins of Philosophy'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), pp. 66\u20137; Derrida,  \" ''Geschlecht'' II: Heidegger's Hand, \"  in [[John Sallis]] (ed.), ''Deconstruction and Philosophy'' (Chicago  &  London: University of Chicago Press, 1987), pp. 181\u20132; Derrida, ''Given Time: I. Counterfeit Money'' (Chicago  &  London: University of Chicago Press, 1992), p. 159, n. 28. < /ref > \n \n ==Works== \n According to the ''Suda'': < ref > Themistius and Simplicius also mention some work  \" on nature \" . The list could refer to book titles or simply their topics. Again, no one can tell because there is no punctuation sign in Ancient Greek. Furthermore, this list is incomplete since the ''Suda'' ends it with {{lang|grc|\u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac}}, thus implying  \" other works \" . < /ref > \n \n * ''[[On Nature (Anaximander)|On Nature]]'' ({{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2}} / ''Per\u00ec ph\u00fase\u00f4s'') \n * ''Rotation of the Earth'' ({{lang|grc|\u0393\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2}} / ''G\u1ec5s per\u00edodos'') \n * ''On Fixed stars'' ({{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u1ff6\u03bd}} / ''Per\u00ec t\u1ed7n aplan\u1ed7n'') \n * ''The [Celestial] Sphere'' ({{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03c6\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b1}} / ''Spha\u0129ra'') \n \n ==See also== \n {{Portal|Philosophy}} \n * [[Material monism]] \n * [[Indefinite monism]] \n \n ==Footnotes== \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n \n ==References== \n \n ===Primary sources=== \n * [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]]: ''Various History'' (III, 17) \n * [[A\u00ebtius (theologian)|A\u00ebtius]]: ''De Fide'' (I-III; V) \n * [[Agathemerus]]: ''A Sketch of Geography in Epitome'' (I, 1) \n * [[Aristotle]]: ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'' (II, 3) Translated by [https://web.archive.org/web/20070217110549/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/meteorology/ E.
