It is listed as a threatened species in the United States and the [[IUCN]] lists the species as near threatened. \n \n During a 2013 study of ''Amblyopsis spelaea'', scientists found that the species was divided into two distinct evolutionary lineages: one north of the [[Ohio River]], in Indiana, and one south of the river, in [[Kentucky]].  The southern population retained the name ''A. spelaea'' and the northern was re-designated ''[[Amblyopsis hoosieri]]'' in a 2014 paper published in the journal ''[[ZooKeys]]''. < ref name= \" ZooKeys \" > {{cite journal |last=Chakrabarty |first=Prosanta |last2=Prejean |first2=Jacques A. |last3=Niemiller |first3=Matthew L. |date=May 29, 2014 |title=The Hoosier cavefish, a new and endangered species (Amblyopsidae, ''Amblyopsis'') from the caves of southern Indiana |url=https://zookeys.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=3824 |journal=[[ZooKeys]] |publisher=Pensoft |volume=412 |pages=41\u201357 |doi=10.3897/zookeys.412.7245 |access-date=January 23, 2015 |pmc=4042695 |pmid=24899861}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web |last=Howard |first=Brian Clark |date=May 30, 2014 |title=Blind Hoosier Cavefish: Freshwater Species of the Week |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2014/05/30/blind-hoosier-cavefish-freshwater-species-of-the-week/ |website=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |access-date=January 23, 2015 }} < /ref >  Neither species is found north of the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]], flowing east to west south of [[Bedford, Indiana]]. \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist}} \n * {{FishBase species|genus=Amblyopsis|species=spelaea|year=2005|month=10}} \n \n {{Taxonbar|from=Q2842127}} \n \n [[Category:Amblyopsidae]] \n [[Category:Cave fish]] \n [[Category:Fish of North America|Cavefish, Northern]] \n [[Category:Fish of the United States]] \n [[Category:Fish described in 1842]] \n [[Category:Taxa named by James Ellsworth De Kay]]"
