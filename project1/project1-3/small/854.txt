The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries, despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the  \" [[Year of the Four Emperors]] \"  over the imperial succession. \n \n Originally named '''Gaius Octavius''', he was born into an old and wealthy [[equites|equestrian branch]] of the [[plebeian]] [[Octavia gens|''gens'' Octavia]]. His maternal great-uncle [[Julius Caesar]] was [[assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] in 44 BC, and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] son and heir, after which he took the name '''Gaius Julius Caesar''', though later historians would take to calling him '''Octavian''' to avoid confusion with his great-uncle. He, [[Mark Antony]], and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]] formed the [[Second Triumvirate]] to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at the [[Battle of Philippi]] (42 BC), the Triumvirate divided the [[Roman Republic]] among themselves and ruled as ''de facto'' [[Roman dictator|dictators]]. The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members; Lepidus was exiled in 36 BC, and Antony was defeated by Octavian at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC. \n \n After the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward fa\u00e7ade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the [[Roman Senate]], the [[Roman magistrate|executive magistrates]], and the [[Roman assemblies|legislative assemblies]], yet maintained autocratic authority by having the Senate grant him lifetime tenure as [[commander-in-chief|supreme military command]], [[tribune]], and [[Roman censor|censor]]. A similar ambiguity is seen in his chosen names, the implied rejection of monarchical titles whereby he called himself ''[[Princeps]] Civitatis'' ( \" First Citizen \" ) juxtaposed with his adoption of the ancient title [[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]. \n \n Augustus dramatically enlarged the Empire, annexing [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Noricum]], and [[Raetia]], expanding possessions in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], and completing the conquest of [[Hispania]], but suffered a [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|major setback]] in [[Germania]]. Beyond the frontiers, he secured the Empire with a buffer region of [[client state]]s and made peace with the [[Parthian Empire]] through diplomacy. He reformed the Roman system of taxation, developed [[Roman roads|networks of roads]] with an [[cursus publicus|official courier system]], established a [[standing army]], established the [[Praetorian Guard]], created official [[cohortes urbanae|police]] and [[vigiles|fire-fighting services]] for Rome, and rebuilt much of the city during his reign. Augustus died in AD 14 at the age of 75, probably from natural causes. Persistent rumors, substantiated somewhat by [[#Death_and_succession|numerous deaths]] in the imperial family, have claimed his wife [[Livia]] poisoned him. He was succeeded as emperor by Livia's son \u2013 also his by adoption and former husband of his only biological daughter [[Julia the Elder|Julia]] \u2013 [[Tiberius]], who consolidated the Principate into a de facto autocratic monarchy, the Roman Empire. \n \n == Name == \n As a consequence of [[Roman naming conventions|Roman customs]], society, and personal preference, Augustus ({{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0|\u02c8|\u0261|\u028c|s|t|\u0259|s|}} {{respell|aw|GUST|\u0259s|}}) was known by many names throughout his life: \n * '''Gaius Octavius''' ({{IPAc-en|\u0252|k|\u02c8|t|e\u026a|v|i|\u0259|s}} {{respell|ok|TAY|vee|\u0259s}}, {{IPA-la|\u02c8\u0261a\u02d0i\u028as \u0254k\u02c8ta\u02d0u\u032fi\u028as|lang}}): He received his [[Given name|birth name]], after his [[Gaius Octavius (father of Augustus)|biological father]], in 63 BC.  \" [[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]] \"  was his [[praenomen]], while  \" [[Octavia gens|Octavius]] \"  was his [[Nomen gentilicium|nomen]].

Mark Antony later used the examples of these battles as a means to belittle Octavian, as both battles were decisively won with the use of Antony's forces. In addition to claiming responsibility for both victories, Antony also branded Octavian as a coward for handing over his direct military control to [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] instead. < ref name= \" eck 17 18 \" > Eck (2003), 17\u201318. < /ref > \n \n After Philippi, a new territorial arrangement was made among the members of the Second Triumvirate. [[Gaul]] and the province of Hispania were placed in the hands of Octavian. Antony traveled east to Egypt where he allied himself with Queen [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra VII]], the former lover of Julius Caesar and mother of Caesar's infant son [[Caesarion]]. Lepidus was left with the [[Africa Province|province of Africa]], stymied by Antony, who conceded Hispania to Octavian instead. < ref name= \" eck 18 \" > Eck (2003), 18. < /ref > \n \n Octavian was left to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of thousands of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land. < ref name= \" eck 18 \"  / >  There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former. < ref name= \" eck 18 19 \" > Eck (2003), 18\u201319. < /ref >  There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions. < ref name= \" eck 19 \" > Eck (2003), 19. < /ref > \n \n ==== Rebellion and marriage alliances ==== \n \n There was widespread dissatisfaction with Octavian over these settlements of his soldiers, and this encouraged many to rally at the side of [[Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Lucius Antonius]], who was brother of Mark Antony and supported by a majority in the Senate. Meanwhile, Octavian asked for a divorce from [[Claudia (wife of Octavian)|Claudia]], the daughter of [[Fulvia]] (Mark Antony's wife) and her first husband [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. He returned Claudia to her mother, claiming that their marriage had never been consummated. Fulvia decided to take action. Together with Lucius Antonius, she raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian. Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian, however, since the Roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries. Lucius and his allies ended up in a defensive siege at [[Perusia]] (modern [[Perugia]]), where Octavian [[Perusine War|forced them into surrender]] in early 40 & nbsp;BC. < ref name= \" eck 19 \"  / > \n [[File:Domus-augusti-2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|Fresco paintings inside the [[House of Augustus]], his residence during his reign as emperor.]] \n \n Lucius and his army were spared, due to his kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia was exiled to [[Sicyon]]. < ref name= \" rowell 32 \" > Rowell (1962), 32. < /ref >  Octavian showed no mercy, however, for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius; on 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesar's assassination, he had 300 Roman senators and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius. < ref name= \" eck 20 \" > Eck (2003), 20. < /ref >  Perusia also was pillaged and burned as a warning for others. < ref name= \" rowell 32 \"  / >  This bloody event sullied Octavian's reputation and was criticized by many, such as Augustan poet [[Sextus Propertius]]. < ref name= \" eck 20 \"  / > \n \n [[Sextus Pompeius]], the son of Pompey and still a renegade general following Julius Caesar's victory over his father, had established himself in [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] as part of an agreement reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39 & nbsp;BC. < ref > Scullard (1982), 162 < /ref >  Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius. Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance in 40 & nbsp;BC when he married [[Scribonia (wife of Octavian)|Scribonia]], a sister or daughter of Pompeius's father-in-law [[Lucius Scribonius Libo]]. Scribonia gave birth to Octavian's only natural child, [[Julia the Elder|Julia]], the same day that he divorced her to marry [[Livia|Livia Drusilla]], little more than a year after their marriage. < ref name= \" eck 20 \"  / > \n \n While in Egypt, Antony had been engaged in an affair with [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] and had fathered twin children with her.{{#tag:ref|These were [[Alexander Helios]], [[Cleopatra Selene II]], and [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]].|group= \" nb \" }} Aware of his deteriorating relationship with Octavian, Antony left Cleopatra; he sailed to Italy in 40 & nbsp;BC with a large force to oppose Octavian, laying siege to Brundisium. This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however. Their centurions, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight due to their Caesarian cause, while the legions under their command followed suit. Meanwhile, in Sicyon, Antony's wife Fulvia died of a sudden illness while Antony was en route to meet her. Fulvia's death and the mutiny of their centurions allowed the two remaining triumvirs to effect a reconciliation. < ref name= \" eck 21 \" > Eck (2003) 21. < /ref > < ref name= \" ccaa 19 \" > Eder (2005), 19. < /ref > \n [[File:Marcus Antonius marble bust in the Vatican Museums.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman portraiture|Roman marble portrait]] bust of [[Mark Antony]], made during the [[Flavian dynasty]] (69\u201396 AD), [[Vatican Museums]]]] \n \n In the autumn of 40, Octavian and Antony approved the Treaty of Brundisium, by which Lepidus would remain in Africa, Antony in the East, Octavian in the West. The [[Italian Peninsula]] was left open to all for the recruitment of soldiers, but in reality, this provision was useless for Antony in the East. To further cement relations of alliance with Mark Antony, Octavian gave his sister, [[Octavia Minor]], in marriage to Antony in late 40 & nbsp;BC. < ref name= \" eck 21 \"  / > \n \n ==== War with Pompeius ==== \n {{Further|Sicilian revolt}} \n \n [[File:Denarius Sextus Pompeius-Scilla.jpg|thumb|400px|A [[denarius]] of [[Sextus Pompeius]], minted for his victory over Octavian's fleet.

As Lepidus and Octavian accepted the surrender of Pompeius's troops, Lepidus attempted to claim Sicily for himself, ordering Octavian to leave.

At the same time, Octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars among the Roman generals and, even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever, his position demanded that he look to the well-being of the city of Rome and the [[Roman province]]s. Octavian's aims from this point forward were to return Rome to a state of stability, traditional legality, and civility by lifting the overt political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free elections\u2014in name at least. < ref name= \" eck 44 45 \" > Eck (2003), 44\u201345. < /ref > \n \n === First settlement === \n {{Main|Constitution of the Roman Empire|History of the Constitution of the Roman Empire}} \n \n In 27 BC, Octavian made a show of returning full power to the Roman Senate and relinquishing his control of the Roman provinces and their armies. Under his consulship, however, the Senate had little power in initiating legislation by introducing [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] for senatorial debate. Octavian was no longer in direct control of the provinces and their armies, but he retained the loyalty of active duty soldiers and veterans alike. The careers of many clients and adherents depended on his [[patronage]], as his financial power was unrivaled in the Roman Republic. < ref name= \" eck 45 \" > Eck (2003), 45. < /ref >  Historian [[Werner Eck]] states: \n \n {{bquote|The sum of his power derived first of all from various powers of office delegated to him by the Senate and people, secondly from his immense private fortune, and thirdly from numerous patron-client relationships he established with individuals and groups throughout the Empire.

He failed to encourage enough senators to finance the building and maintenance of networks of roads in Italy in 20 BC, but he undertook direct responsibility for them. This was publicized on the Roman currency issued in 16 BC, after he donated vast amounts of money to the ''[[aerarium Saturni]]'', the public treasury. < ref name= \" eck 80 \" > Eck (2003), 80. < /ref > \n [[File:Caesar augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Octavian as a magistrate.

Scullard, however, Octavian's power was based on the exercise of  \" a predominant military power and & nbsp;... the ultimate sanction of his authority was force, however much the fact was disguised. \" < ref name =  \" Scullard_p211 \" > Scullard (1982), 211. < /ref >  The Senate proposed to Octavian, the victor of Rome's civil wars, that he once again assume command of the provinces. The Senate's proposal was a ratification of Octavian's extra-constitutional power. Through the Senate, Octavian was able to continue the appearance of a still-functional [[constitution of the Roman Republic|constitution]]. Feigning reluctance, he accepted a ten-year responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered chaotic. < ref name= \" eck 46 \" > Eck (2003), 46. < /ref > < ref > Scullard (1982), 210. < /ref > \n \n The provinces ceded to Augustus for that ten-year period comprised much of the conquered Roman world, including all of Hispania and Gaul, [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cyprus]], and [[\u00c6gyptus|Egypt]]. < ref name= \" eck 46 \"  / > < ref name= \" ccaa 34 \" > Gruen (2005), 34. < /ref >  Moreover, command of these provinces provided Octavian with control over the majority of Rome's legions. < ref name= \" ccaa 34 \"  / > < ref name= \" eck 47 \" > Eck (2003), 47. < /ref > \n \n While Octavian acted as consul in Rome, he dispatched senators to the provinces under his command as his representatives to manage provincial affairs and ensure that his orders were carried out. The provinces not under Octavian's control were overseen by governors chosen by the Roman Senate. < ref name= \" eck 47 \"  / >  Octavian became the most powerful political figure in the city of Rome and in most of its provinces, but he did not have a monopoly on political and martial power. < ref name= \" ccaa 24 \"  / > \n \n The Senate still controlled North Africa, an important regional [[Roman agriculture|producer of grain]], as well as [[Illyria]] and Macedonia, two strategic regions with several legions. < ref name= \" ccaa 24 \"  / >  However, the Senate had control of only five or six legions distributed among three senatorial proconsuls, compared to the twenty legions under the control of Octavian, and their control of these regions did not amount to any political or military challenge to Octavian. < ref name= \" ccaa 24 25 \" > Eder (2005), 24\u201325. < /ref > < ref name =  \" Scullard_p211 \"  / >  The Senate's control over some of the Roman provinces helped maintain a republican fa\u00e7ade for the autocratic Principate.

With this title, he boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar, and the use of ''[[Imperator]]'' signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory. He transformed ''Caesar'', a cognomen for one branch of the [[Julius|Julian family]], into a new family line that began with him. < ref name= \" eck 50 \"  / > \n \n [[File:Arch of Augustus at Ariminum, dedicated to the Emperor Augustus by the Roman Senate in 27 BC, the oldest Roman arch which survives, Rimini, Italy (19948839545).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Arch of Augustus (Rimini)|Arch of Augustus]] in [[Rimini]] (Ariminum), dedicated to Augustus by the [[Roman Senate]] in 27 BC, the oldest surviving [[List of Roman triumphal arches|Roman triumphal arch]]]] \n \n Augustus was granted the right to hang the ''[[corona civica]]'' above his door, the  \" civic crown \"  made from oak, and to have laurels drape his doorposts. < ref name= \" ccaa 24 \" > Eder (2005), 24. < /ref >  However, he renounced flaunting insignia of power such as holding a [[scepter]], wearing a [[diadem (personal wear)|diadem]], or wearing the golden crown and purple [[toga]] of his predecessor Julius Caesar. < ref name= \" ccaa 13 \" > Eder (2005), 13. < /ref >  If he refused to symbolize his power by donning and bearing these items on his person, the Senate nonetheless awarded him with a golden shield displayed in the meeting hall of the [[Curia]], bearing the inscription ''virtus'', ''pietas'', ''clementia'', ''iustitia''\u2014 \" valor, piety, clemency, and justice. \" < ref name= \" ccaa 24 \"  / > < ref name= \" eck 3 \" > Eck (2003), 3. < /ref > \n \n === Second settlement === \n [[File:Roman - Portrait of Emperor Augustus - Walters 2321.jpg|thumb|right|Portraits of Augustus show the emperor with idealized features]] \n By 23 & nbsp;BC, some of the un-Republican implications were becoming apparent concerning the settlement of 27 & nbsp;BC.

Augustus prepared to hand down his [[Seal (device)#Signet rings|signet ring]] to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus's supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed. < ref name= \" ccaa 25 \" > Eder (2005), 25. < /ref > < ref name= \" eck 56 \" > Eck (2003), 56. < /ref >  This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor. < ref name= \" ccaa 38 \" > Gruen (2005), 38. < /ref > \n \n Augustus bestowed only properties and possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy. < ref name= \" ccaa 38 39 \" > Gruen (2005), 38\u201339. < /ref >  With regards to the Principate, it was obvious to Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position; < ref name= \" Stern, Gaius p. 23 \" > Stern, Gaius, ''Women, children, and senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae: A study of Augustus's vision of a new world order in 13 BC'', p. 23 < /ref >  nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they should continue to obey Agrippa. < ref > Holland, pp. 294\u201395; Southern, p. 108 < /ref > \n \n [[File:Cameo August BM Gem3577.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Blacas Cameo]] showing Augustus wearing a ''[[gorgoneion]]'' on a three layered [[sardonyx]] cameo, AD 20\u201350]] \n Soon after his bout of illness subsided, Augustus gave up his consulship. The only other times Augustus would serve as consul would be in the years 5 and 2 & nbsp;BC, < ref name= \" eck 56 \"  / > < ref name= \" ccaa 26 \" > Eder (2005), 26. < /ref >  both times to introduce his grandsons into public life. < ref name= \" Davies, p. 259 \"  / >  This was a clever ploy by Augustus; ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain the consular position, while allowing Augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class. < ref name= \" ccaa 36 \"  / >  Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his consular ''[[imperium]]'' not just in his provinces but throughout the empire. This desire, as well as the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement. < ref name= \" eck 57 \" > Eck (2003), 57. < /ref > \n \n === Primary reasons for the Second Settlement === \n The primary reasons for the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, he was no longer in an official position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a [[proconsul]]. < ref name= \" eck 56 \"  / > < ref name= \" ccaa 37 \" > Gruen (2005), 37. < /ref >  When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary. < ref name= \" eck 56 57 \" > Eck (2003), 56\u201357. < /ref > \n \n A second problem later arose showing the need for the Second Settlement in what became known as the  \" Marcus Primus Affair \" . < ref name= \" Southern p. 109 \" > Southern, p. 109; Holland, p. 299 < /ref >  In late 24 or early 23 & nbsp;BC, charges were brought against Marcus Primus, the former proconsul (governor) of Macedonia, for waging a war without prior approval of the Senate on the [[Odrysian]] kingdom of [[Thrace]], whose king was a Roman ally. < ref > Wells, p. 53 < /ref >  He was defended by [[Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena]], who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus, ordering him to attack the client state. < ref name= \" Southern, p. 108 \" > Southern, p. 108 < /ref >  Later, Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus. < ref > Holland, p. 300 < /ref > \n \n Such orders, had they been given, would have been considered a breach of the Senate's prerogative under the Constitutional settlement of 27 BC and its aftermath\u2014i.e., before Augustus was granted ''imperium proconsulare maius''\u2014as Macedonia was a Senatorial province under the Senate's jurisdiction, not an imperial province under the authority of Augustus. Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of Republican restoration as promoted by Augustus, and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen, a first among equals. < ref name= \" Southern, p. 108 \"  / >  Even worse, the involvement of Marcellus provided some measure of proof that Augustus's policy was to have the youth take his place as Princeps, instituting a form of monarchy & nbsp;\u2013 accusations that had already played out. < ref name= \" Stern, Gaius p. 23 \"  / > \n [[File:Augusto come giove, 00-50 dc circa.JPG|thumb|upright|Augustus as [[Jove]], holding a scepter and orb (first half of 1st century AD)]] \n \n The situation was so serious that Augustus himself appeared at the trial, even though he had not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order. < ref > Syme, p. 333 < /ref >  Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his ''[[auctoritas]]''. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. < ref > Syme, p. 333; Holland, p. 300; Southern, p. 108 < /ref >  Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'. < ref > Wells, p. 53; Raaflaub, p. 426 < /ref > \n \n The Second Constitutional Settlement was completed in part to allay confusion and formalize Augustus's legal authority to intervene in Senatorial provinces. The Senate granted Augustus a form of general ''imperium proconsulare'', or proconsular imperium (power) that applied throughout the empire, not solely to his provinces. Moreover, the Senate augmented Augustus's proconsular imperium into ''imperium proconsulare maius'', or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more (maius) or greater than that held by the other proconsuls. This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire. < ref name= \" eck 57 \"  / >  Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support, thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13 & nbsp;BC. < ref name= \" ccaa 26 \"  / > \n \n === Additional powers === \n During the second settlement, Augustus was also granted the power of a [[tribune of the plebs|tribune]] (''tribunicia potestas'') for life, though not the official title of tribune. < ref name= \" eck 57 \"  / >  For some years, Augustus had been awarded ''tribunicia sacrosanctitas'', the immunity given to a [[Tribune of the Plebs]]. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to [[Patrician (Ancient Rome)|patricians]], a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar. < ref name= \" ccaa 36 \" > Gruen (2005), 36. < /ref > \n \n This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting. < ref name= \" ccaa 26 \"  / > < ref name= \" eck 57 58 \" > Eck (2003), 57\u201358. < /ref >  Also included in Augustus's tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the [[Roman censor]]; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a [[census]] and determine the membership of the Senate. < ref name= \" eck 59 \" > Eck (2003), 59. < /ref > \n \n With the powers of a censor, Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all attire but the classic toga while entering the Forum. < ref name= \" ccaa 30 \" > Eder (2005), 30. < /ref >  There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position, nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor. < ref name= \" bunson 80 \" > Bunson (1994), 80. < /ref >  Julius Caesar had been granted similar powers, wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state. However, this position did not extend to the censor's ability to hold a census and determine the Senate's roster. The office of the ''tribunus plebis'' began to lose its prestige due to Augustus's amassing of tribunal powers, so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the [[praetor]]ship. < ref name= \" bunson 427 \" > Bunson (1994), 427. < /ref > \n \n [[File:August Labicana Massimo Inv56230 n2.jpg|thumb|[[Via Labicana Augustus|Head of Augustus]] as [[Pontifex Maximus]], Roman artwork of the late Augustan period, last decade of the 1st century BC]] \n Augustus was granted sole ''imperium'' within the city of Rome itself, in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular  \" imperium \"  when they crossed the [[Pomerium]] \u2013 the sacred boundary of Rome \u2013 and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, when he was in the city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or ''auctoritas'', his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus. < ref name= \" eck 60 \" > Eck (2003), 60. < /ref > \n \n In addition, the credit was given to Augustus for each subsequent Roman military victory after this time, because the majority of Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the [[legatus]] who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus's proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general. [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus the Younger|Lucius Cornelius Balbus]] was the last man outside Augustus's family to receive this award, in 19 & nbsp;BC. < ref name= \" eck 61 \" > Eck (2003), 61. < /ref >  Tiberius, Augustus's eldest stepson by Livia, was the only other general to receive a triumph\u2014for victories in Germania in 7 & nbsp;BC. < ref name= \" eck 117 \" > Eck (2003), 117. < /ref > \n \n Normally during republican times, the powers Augustus held even after the Second Settlement would have been split between several people, who would each exercise them with the assistance of a colleague and for a specific period of time. Augustus held them all at once by himself, and with no time limits; even those that nominally had time limits were automatically renewed whenever they lapsed. < ref > [https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Rome/Augustan-art-and-literature#ref26662 Ancient Rome] at [[Encyclopedia Britannica]] < /ref > \n \n === Conspiracy === \n [[File:Augustus MAN Napoli Inv6040.jpg|thumb|left|A colossal statue of Augustus from the [[Sodales Augustales|Augusteum]] of [[Herculaneum]], seated and wearing a [[laurel wreath]].]] \n Many of the political subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class, who were Augustus's greatest supporters and clientele. This caused them to insist upon Augustus's participation in imperial affairs from time to time. Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22 & nbsp;BC, and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In 22, 21, and 19 & nbsp;BC, the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus. < ref > Dio [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#1 54.1], [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#6 6], [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#10 10]. < /ref > \n \n Likewise, there was a food shortage in Rome in 22 & nbsp;BC which sparked panic, while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis. After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Rome's grain supply  \" by virtue of his proconsular ''imperium'' \" , and ended the crisis almost immediately. < ref name= \" ccaa 26 \"  / >  It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a ''praefectus annonae'', a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for Rome. < ref name= \" eck 78 \" > Eck (2003), 78. < /ref > \n \n There were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio. < ref name= \" Southern p. 109 \" / >  Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio. < ref > Swan, p. 241; Syme, p. 483 < /ref >  [[Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena|Murena]], the outspoken Consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus Affair, was named among the conspirators.

Like his tribune authority, the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold. < ref name= \" ccaa 43 \"  / >  In addition, Augustus was allowed to wear the consul's insignia in public and before the Senate, < ref name= \" eck 60 \"  / >  as well as to sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the [[fasces]], an emblem of consular authority. < ref name= \" ccaa 43 \" > Gruen (2005), 43. < /ref >  This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was a consul, the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary. On 6 March 12 & nbsp;BC, after the death of [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]], he additionally took up the position of pontifex maximus, the high priest of the college of the Pontiffs, the most important position in Roman religion. < ref > Bowersock (1990), p. 380.

Dio [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#27.2 27.2] reports this under 13 & nbsp;BC, probably as the year in which Lepidus died (Bowersock (1990), p. 383). < /ref > < ref name= \" ccaa 28 \" > Eder (2005), 28. < /ref >  On 5 February 2 & nbsp;BC, Augustus was also given the title ''[[pater patriae]]'', or  \" father of the country \" . < ref > Mackay (2004), 186. < /ref > < ref name= \" eck 129 \" > Eck (2003), 129. < /ref > \n \n === Stability and staying power === \n A final reason for the Second Settlement was to give the Principate constitutional stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread of the life of one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life. < ref > [[The Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], ''Augustus'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#81 81]. < /ref >  If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid in the minds of many citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] for five years, similar to Augustus's power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus's imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas. < ref > Syme (1939), 337\u2013338. < /ref >  Augustus's accumulation of powers was now complete.

By the year 13, Augustus boasted 21 occasions where his troops proclaimed  \" imperator \"  as his title after a successful battle. Almost the entire fourth chapter in his publicly released memoirs of achievements known as the ''Res Gestae'' was devoted to his military victories and honors. < ref name= \" eck 93 \" > Eck (2003), 93. < /ref > \n \n Augustus also promoted the ideal of a superior Roman civilization with a task of ruling the world (to the extent to which the Romans knew it), a sentiment embodied in words that the contemporary poet [[Virgil]] attributes to a legendary ancestor of Augustus: ''tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento''\u2014 \" Roman, remember by your strength to rule the Earth's peoples! \" < ref name= \" ccaa 30 \"  / >  The impulse for [[expansionism]] was apparently prominent among all classes at Rome, and it is accorded divine sanction by Virgil's Jupiter in Book 1 of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', where Jupiter promises Rome ''imperium sine fine'',  \" sovereignty without end \" . < ref name= \" eck 95 \" > Eck (2003), 95. < /ref > \n \n By the end of his reign, the armies of Augustus had conquered northern Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal) and the [[Alps|Alpine]] regions of [[Raetia]] and [[Noricum]] (modern Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, Slovenia), [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and [[Pannonia]] (modern Albania, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, etc.), and had extended the borders of the [[Africa Province]] to the east and south. [[Iudaea Province|Judea]] was added to the [[Syria (Roman province)|province of Syria]] when Augustus deposed [[Herod Archelaus]], successor to [[client state|client king]] [[Herod the Great]] (73\u20134 & nbsp;BC).

To ensure security of the Empire's eastern flank, Augustus stationed a Roman army in Syria, while his skilled stepson Tiberius negotiated with the Parthians as Rome's diplomat to the East. < ref name= \" eck 96 \" > Eck (2003), 96. < /ref >  Tiberius was responsible for restoring [[Tigranes V of Armenia|Tigranes V]] to the throne of the Kingdom of Armenia. < ref name= \" bunson 416 \"  / > \n \n Yet arguably his greatest diplomatic achievement was negotiating with [[Phraates IV of Parthia]] (37\u20132 & nbsp;BC) in 20 & nbsp;BC for the return of the [[Vexilloid|battle standards]] lost by [[Crassus]] in the [[Battle of Carrhae]], a symbolic victory and great boost of morale for Rome. < ref name= \" bunson 416 \" > Bunson (1994), 416. < /ref > < ref name= \" eck 96 \"  / > < ref > Brosius (2006), 96\u201397, 136\u2013138. < /ref >  Werner Eck claims that this was a great disappointment for Romans seeking to avenge Crassus's defeat by military means. < ref name= \" eck 95 96 \" > Eck (2003), 95\u201396. < /ref >  However, Maria Brosius explains that Augustus used the return of the standards as [[propaganda]] symbolizing the submission of Parthia to Rome.

From the book ''Romanorum Imperatorum effigies'' (1583), preserved in the Municipal Library of Trento (Italy)]] \n \n The illness of Augustus in 23 & nbsp;BC brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed to Augustus's unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits. < ref name= \" ccaa 50 \" > Gruen (2005), 50. < /ref > \n \n Some Augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sister's son [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]], who had been quickly married to Augustus's daughter [[Julia the Elder]]. < ref name= \" eck 114 115 \" > Eck (2003), 114\u2013115. < /ref >  Other historians dispute this due to Augustus's will being read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23 & nbsp;BC, < ref name= \" eck 115 \" > Eck (2003), 115. < /ref >  instead indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa, who was Augustus's second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together. < ref name= \" ccaa 44 \"  / > \n \n After the death of Marcellus in 23 & nbsp;BC, Augustus married his daughter to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: [[Gaius Caesar]], [[Lucius Caesar]], [[Vipsania Julia]], [[Agrippina the Elder]], and [[Agrippa Postumus|Postumus Agrippa]], so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the eastern half of the Empire with the ''imperium'' of a proconsul and the same ''tribunicia potestas'' granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus's authority), his seat of governance stationed at [[Samos]] in the eastern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. < ref name= \" ccaa 44 \" > Gruen (2005), 44. < /ref > < ref name= \" eck 58 \" > Eck (2003), 58. < /ref >  This granting of power showed Augustus's favor for Agrippa, but it was also a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him. < ref name= \" eck 58 \"  / > \n [[File:Augustuksen mauseleomi.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]]] \n \n Augustus's intent became apparent to make Gaius and Lucius Caesar his heirs when he adopted them as his own children. < ref > Syme (1939), 416\u2013417. < /ref >  He took the consulship in 5 and 2 & nbsp;BC so that he could personally usher them into their political careers, < ref > Scullard (1982), 217. < /ref >  and they were nominated for the consulships of AD 1 and 4. < ref > Syme (1939), 417. < /ref >  Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livia's children from her first marriage [[Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus]] (henceforth referred to as Drusus) and [[Tiberius|Tiberius Claudius]] (henceforth Tiberius), granting them military commands and public office, though seeming to favor Drusus. After Agrippa died in 12 & nbsp;BC, Tiberius was ordered to divorce his own wife [[Vipsania Agrippina]] and marry Agrippa's widow, Augustus's daughter Julia\u2014as soon as a period of mourning for Agrippa had ended. < ref name= \" eck 116 \" > Eck (2003), 116. < /ref >  Drusus's marriage to Augustus's niece [[Antonia Minor|Antonia]] was considered an unbreakable affair, whereas Vipsania was  \" only \"  the daughter of the late Agrippa from his first marriage. < ref name= \" eck 116 \"  / > \n \n Tiberius shared in Augustus's tribune powers as of 6 & nbsp;BC, but shortly thereafter went into retirement, reportedly wanting no further role in politics while he exiled himself to [[Rhodes]]. < ref name= \" eck 117 \"  / > < ref name= \" ccaa 46 \" > Gruen (2005), 46. < /ref >  No specific reason is known for his departure, though it could have been a combination of reasons, including a failing marriage with Julia, < ref name= \" eck 117 \"  / > < ref name= \" ccaa 46 \"  / >  as well as a sense of envy and exclusion over Augustus's apparent favouring of his young grandchildren-turned-sons Gaius and Lucius.

He certainly fell out of Augustus's favor as an heir; the historian Erich S.

Augustus's health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death, and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power, having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as his choice of heir. < ref name= \" eck 123 \" > Eck (2003), 123. < /ref >  It is likely that Augustus was not expected to return alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger that transition. < ref name= \" Everitt \" / > \n \n Augustus's famous last words were,  \" Have I played the part well?

Publicly, though, his last words were,  \" Behold, I found Rome of clay, and leave her to you of marble \"  ({{lang|la| \" Marmoream se relinquere, quam latericiam accepisset \" }}).

Both his adoptive surname, Caesar, and his title ''Augustus'' became the permanent titles of the rulers of the Roman Empire for fourteen centuries after his death, in use both at [[Rome|Old Rome]] and at [[Constantinople|New Rome]]. In many languages, ''Caesar'' became the word for ''Emperor'', as in the German ''[[Kaiser]]'' and in the Bulgarian and subsequently Russian ''[[Tsar]]'' (sometimes Csar or Czar). The cult of ''Divus Augustus'' continued until the state religion of the Empire was changed to [[Christianity]] in 391 by [[Theodosius I]]. Consequently, there are many excellent statues and busts of the first emperor. He had composed an account of his achievements, the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', to be inscribed in bronze in front of [[Mausoleum of Augustus|his mausoleum]]. < ref > Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#101.4 101.4]. < /ref >  Copies of the text were inscribed throughout the Empire upon his death. < ref name= \" eck 1 2 \" > Eck (2003), 1\u20132 < /ref >  The inscriptions in Latin featured translations in Greek beside it, and were inscribed on many public edifices, such as the temple in [[Ankara]] dubbed the ''Monumentum Ancyranum'', called the  \" queen of inscriptions \"  by historian [[Theodor Mommsen]]. < ref name= \" eck 2 \" > Eck (2003), 2. < /ref > \n \n The ''Res Gestae'' is the only work to have survived from antiquity, though Augustus is also known to have composed poems entitled ''Sicily'', ''Epiphanus'', and ''Ajax'', an autobiography of 13 books, a philosophical treatise, and a written rebuttal to Brutus's ''Eulogy of Cato''. < ref name= \" bunson 47 \" > Bunson (1994), 47. < /ref >  Historians are able to analyze excerpts of letters penned by Augustus, preserved in other works, to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life. < ref name= \" shaw-smith 213 \" > Shaw-Smith (1971), 213. < /ref > < ref > Bourne (1918), 53\u201366. < /ref > \n \n Many consider Augustus to be Rome's greatest emperor; his policies certainly extended the Empire's life span and initiated the celebrated ''Pax Romana'' or ''Pax Augusta''. The Roman Senate wished subsequent emperors to  \" [[Felicior Augusto, melior Traiano|be more fortunate than Augustus and better than Trajan]] \" . Augustus was intelligent, decisive, and a shrewd politician, but he was not perhaps as charismatic as Julius Caesar and was influenced on occasion by Livia (sometimes for the worse). Nevertheless, his legacy proved more enduring. The city of Rome was utterly transformed under Augustus, with Rome's first institutionalized [[History of criminal justice|police force]], [[fire fighting]] force, and the establishment of the municipal [[prefect]] as a permanent office. The police force was divided into cohorts of 500 men each, while the units of firemen ranged from 500 to 1,000 men each, with 7 units assigned to 14 divided city sectors. < ref name= \" eck 79 \"  / > \n \n A ''[[praefectus vigilum]]'', or  \" Prefect of the Watch \"  was put in charge of the [[vigiles]], Rome's fire brigade and police. < ref name= \" bunson 345 \" > Bunson (1994), 345. < /ref >  With Rome's civil wars at an end, Augustus was also able to create a [[standing army]] for the Roman Empire, fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170,000 soldiers. < ref name= \" eck 85 86 \" > Eck (2003), 85\u201387. < /ref >  This was supported by numerous [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] units of 500 non-citizen soldiers each, often recruited from recently conquered areas. < ref name= \" eck 86 \" > Eck (2003), 86. < /ref > \n \n With his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout Italy, Augustus also installed an official [[courier]] system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the ''praefectus vehiculorum''. < ref name= \" eck 81 \"  / >  Besides the advent of swifter communication among Italian polities, his extensive building of roads throughout Italy also allowed Rome's armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country. < ref name= \" chisholm 122 \" > Chisholm (1981), 122. < /ref >  In the year 6 Augustus established the ''[[aerarium militare]]'', donating 170 & nbsp;million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers. < ref name= \" bunson 6 \" > Bunson (1994), 6. < /ref > \n \n One of the most enduring institutions of Augustus was the establishment of the Praetorian Guard in 27 & nbsp;BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome. < ref name= \" bunson 341 \" > Bunson (1994), 341. < /ref >  They had the power to intimidate the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked; the last emperor they served was [[Maxentius]], as it was [[Constantine I]] who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the [[Castra Praetoria]]. < ref name= \" bunson 341 342 \" > Bunson (1994), 341\u2013342. < /ref > \n \n [[File:Augustus-in-Kalabsha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Augustus in an Egyptian-style depiction, a stone carving of the [[New Kalabsha|Kalabsha Temple]] in [[Nubia]]]] \n Although the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms.

The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a [[de facto]] monarchy in these years. Augustus's own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus's ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title. < ref name= \" eck 124 \"  / >  The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire. < ref name= \" kelsall 120 \" > Kelsall (1976), 120. < /ref > \n \n However, for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate, Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages. The contemporary Roman jurist [[Marcus Antistius Labeo]] (d. AD 10/11), fond of the days of pre-Augustan republican [[liberty]] in which he had been born, openly criticized the Augustan regime. In the beginning of his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (c. 56\u2013c.117) wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery. He continued to say that, with Augustus's death and swearing of loyalty to Tiberius, the people of Rome simply traded one slaveholder for another. < ref name= \" starr 5 \" > Starr (1952), 5. < /ref >  Tacitus, however, records two contradictory but common views of Augustus: \n \n {{quote|Intelligent people praised or criticized him in varying ways. One opinion was as follows. Filial duty and a national emergency, in which there was no place for law-abiding conduct, had driven him to civil war\u2014and this can neither be initiated nor maintained by decent methods. He had made many concessions to Anthony and to Lepidus for the sake of vengeance on his father's murderers. When Lepidus grew old and lazy, and Anthony's self-indulgence got the better of him, the only possible cure for the distracted country had been government by one man. However, Augustus had put the state in order not by making himself king or dictator, but by creating the Principate. The Empire's frontiers were on the ocean, or distant rivers. Armies, provinces, fleets, the whole system was interrelated. Roman citizens were protected by the law. Provincials were decently treated. Rome itself had been lavishly beautified. Force had been sparingly used\u2014merely to preserve peace for the majority. < ref > Tacitus, The Annals, I 9 < /ref > }} \n [[File:Augustus Bronze X23322 NAMAthens.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a bronze equestrian statue of Augustus, 1st century AD, [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]]] \n [[File:VirgilAeneidVI.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Virgil]] reading the [[Aeneid]] to Augustus and Octavia'', by [[Jean-Joseph Taillasson]], 1787]] \n According to the second opposing opinion: \n {{quote|filial duty and national crisis had been merely pretexts.

The story of his career shows that Augustus was indeed ruthless, cruel, and ambitious for himself. This was only in part a personal trait, for upper-class Romans were educated to compete with one another and to excel. However, he combined an overriding concern for his personal interests with a deep-seated patriotism, based on a nostalgia of Rome's antique virtues. In his capacity as ''princeps'', selfishness and selflessness coexisted in his mind. While fighting for dominance, he paid little attention to legality or to the normal civilities of political life. He was devious, untrustworthy, and bloodthirsty. But once he had established his authority, he governed efficiently and justly, generally allowed freedom of speech, and promoted the rule of law. He was immensely hardworking and tried as hard as any [[Democracy in Ancient Rome|democratic]] parliamentarian to treat his senatorial colleagues with respect and sensitivity. He suffered from no delusions of grandeur. < ref > [[Anthony Everitt|Everitt]] (2006), 324\u2013325. < /ref > }} \n \n Tacitus was of the belief that [[Nerva]] (r. 96\u201398) successfully  \" mingled two formerly alien ideas, principate and liberty \" . < ref name= \" starr 6 \" > Starr (1952), 6. < /ref >  The 3rd-century historian Cassius Dio acknowledged Augustus as a benign, moderate ruler, yet like most other historians after the death of Augustus, Dio viewed Augustus as an [[Autocracy|autocrat]]. < ref name= \" starr 5 \"  / >  The poet [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus]] (AD 39\u201365) was of the opinion that Caesar's victory over Pompey and the fall of [[Cato the Younger]] (95 BC\u201346 & nbsp;BC) marked the end of traditional liberty in Rome; historian Chester G.

In his criticism of Augustus, the admiral and historian [[Thomas Gordon (Royal Scots Navy officer)|Thomas Gordon]] (1658\u20131741) compared Augustus to the puritanical tyrant [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1599\u20131658). < ref name= \" kelsall 118 \" > Kelsall (1976), 118. < /ref >  Thomas Gordon and the French political philosopher [[Montesquieu]] (1689\u20131755) both remarked that Augustus was a coward in battle. < ref name= \" kelsall 119 \" > Kelsall (1976), 119. < /ref >  In his ''Memoirs of the Court of Augustus'', the Scottish scholar [[Thomas Blackwell (scholar)|Thomas Blackwell]] (1701\u20131757) deemed Augustus a [[Machiavelli]]an ruler,  \" a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper \" ,  \" wicked and worthless \" ,  \" a mean spirit \" , and a  \" tyrant \" . < ref name= \" kelsall 119 \"  / > \n \n === Revenue reforms === \n [[File:AugustusCoinPudukottaiHoardIndia.jpg|thumb|left|Coin of Augustus found at the [[Pudukottai]] hoard, from an [[ancient Tamil country]], [[Pandyan Kingdom]] of present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] in India, a testimony to [[Indo-Roman trade]].

Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus's predecessors had done. This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute. < ref name= \" eck 83 84 \" > Eck (2003), 83\u201384. < /ref > \n [[File:HymiariteKingdomAugustusImitation1stCenturyCE.jpg|thumb|right|1st century coin of the [[Himyarite]] Kingdom, southern coast of the [[Arabian peninsula]]. This is also an imitation of a coin of Augustus.]] \n The measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province. Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces. Indirect taxes included a 4% tax on the price of slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the [[next of kin]]. < ref name= \" bunson 404 \" > Bunson (1994), 404. < /ref > \n \n An equally important reform was the abolition of private [[tax farming]], which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors who collected taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era. Some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome. These tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations, great private wealth, and the right to tax local areas. < ref name= \" eck 83 84 \"  / > \n \n The use of Egypt's immense land rents to finance the Empire's operations resulted from Augustus's conquest of Egypt and the shift to a Roman form of government. < ref name= \" bunson 144 \" > Bunson (1994), 144. < /ref >  As it was effectively considered Augustus's private property rather than a province of the Empire, it became part of each succeeding emperor's patrimonium. < ref name= \" bunson 144 145 \" > Bunson (1994), 144\u2013145. < /ref > \n \n Instead of a legate or proconsul, Augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer Egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports; this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming [[Praetorian prefect|Prefect of the Praetorian Guard]]. < ref name= \" bunson 145 \" > Bunson (1994), 145. < /ref >  The highly productive agricultural land of Egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to Augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions. < ref name= \" bunson 144 \"  / >  During his reign the [[Venatio|circus games]] resulted in the killing of 3,500 [[North African elephant|elephants]]. < ref name= \" Woolf2007 \" > {{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94NuSg3tlsgC & q=3%2C500+elephants|year=2007|publisher=Barnes  &  Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=397}} < /ref > \n \n === Month of August === \n The month of August (Latin: ''Augustus'') is named after Augustus; until his time it was called [[Sextilis]] (named so because it had been the sixth month of the original [[Roman calendar]] and the Latin word for six is ''sex''). Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesar's July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar [[Johannes de Sacrobosco]]. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see [[Julian calendar]]). \n \n According to a ''senatus consultum'' quoted by [[Macrobius]], Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, fell in that month. < ref > Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#12.35 1.12.35]. < /ref > \n \n ===Creation of  \" Italia \" === \n [[Roman Italy]] was established by Augustus in 7 BC with the Latin name  \" Italia \" . This was the first time that the [[Italian peninsula]] was united administratively and politically under the same name. Due to this act, Augustus was called the ''Father of Italy'' by Italian historians such as G. Giannelli. < ref > G. Giannelli, Trattato di storia romana. 1.

Even his [[Mausoleum of Augustus]] was built before his death to house members of his family. < ref name= \" eck 118 121 \" > Eck (2003), 118\u2013121 < /ref >  To celebrate his victory at the Battle of Actium, the [[Arch of Augustus, Rome|Arch of Augustus]] was built in 29 & nbsp;BC near the entrance of the [[Temple of Castor and Pollux]], and widened in 19 & nbsp;BC to include a triple-arch design. < ref name= \" bunson 34 \"  / > \n \n [[File:Vienne-RomanTemple2.JPG|thumb|The Temple of Augustus and [[Livia]] in [[Vienne, Is\u00e8re|Vienne]], late 1st century BC]] \n After the death of Agrippa in 12 & nbsp;BC, a solution had to be found in maintaining Rome's water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense. In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into disrepair. < ref name= \" eck 79 \" > Eck (2003), 79. < /ref > \n \n In the late Augustan era, the commission of five senators called the ''curatores locorum publicorum iudicandorum'' (translated as  \" Supervisors of Public Property \" ) was put in charge of maintaining public buildings and temples of the state cult. < ref name= \" eck 79 \"  / >  Augustus created the senatorial group of the ''curatores viarum'' (translated as  \" Supervisors for Roads \" ) for the upkeep of roads; this senatorial commission worked with local officials and contractors to organize regular repairs. < ref name= \" eck 81 \" > Eck (2003), 81. < /ref > \n \n The [[Corinthian order]] of architectural style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural style in the age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome.
