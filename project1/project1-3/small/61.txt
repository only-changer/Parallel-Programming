The [[kinetic energy]] of the ground state cannot be removed.  \n   \n Scientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero, where matter exhibits [[Quantum mechanics|quantum effects]] such as [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]], [[superconductivity]] and [[superfluidity]]. \n \n ==Thermodynamics near absolute zero== \n At temperatures near {{convert|0|K|C F}}, nearly all molecular motion ceases and \u0394''S'' & nbsp;= & nbsp;0 for any [[adiabatic process]], where ''S'' is the [[entropy]]. In such a circumstance, pure substances can (ideally) form [[perfect crystal]]s as ''T'' \u2192 0. [[Max Planck]]'s strong form of the [[third law of thermodynamics]] states the [[entropy]] of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero. The original [[Walther Nernst|Nernst]] ''[[Nernst heat theorem|heat theorem]]'' makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any [[isothermal process]] approaches zero as ''T'' \u2192 0: \n : < math >  \\lim_{T \\to 0} \\Delta S = 0  < /math > \n \n The implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches a constant value. \n \n < blockquote > The [[Third law of thermodynamics|Nernst postulate]] identifies the [[isothermal process|isotherm]] T & nbsp;= & nbsp;0 as coincident with the [[adiabat]] S & nbsp;= & nbsp;0, although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct. As no two adiabats intersect, no other adiabat can [[Line\u2013line intersection|intersect]] the T & nbsp;= & nbsp;0 isotherm. Consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature. (\u2248 & nbsp;Callen, pp. & nbsp;189\u2013190) < /blockquote > \n \n A perfect crystal is one in which the internal [[lattice (group)|lattice]] structure extends uninterrupted in all directions. The perfect order can be represented by translational [[symmetry]] along three (not usually [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]) [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]]. Every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place, whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping. For [[chemical substance|substances]] that exist in two (or more) stable crystalline forms, such as diamond and [[graphite]] for [[carbon]], there is a kind of ''chemical degeneracy''. The question remains whether both can have zero entropy at ''T'' & nbsp;= & nbsp;0 even though each is perfectly ordered. \n \n Perfect crystals never occur in practice; imperfections, and even entire amorphous material inclusions, can and do get  \" frozen in \"  at low temperatures, so transitions to more stable states do not occur. \n \n Using the [[Debye model]], the [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to ''T'' < sup > & nbsp;3 < /sup > , while the [[enthalpy]] and [[chemical potential]] are proportional to ''T'' < sup > & nbsp;4 < /sup > . (Guggenheim, p. & nbsp;111) These quantities drop toward their ''T'' & nbsp;= & nbsp;0 limiting values and approach with ''zero'' slopes. For the specific heats at least, the limiting value itself is definitely zero, as borne out by experiments to below 10 & nbsp;K. Even the less detailed [[Einstein solid|Einstein model]] shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish at absolute zero, not just those of crystals. Likewise for the coefficient of [[thermal expansion]]. [[Maxwell relations|Maxwell's relations]] show that various other quantities also vanish. These [[phenomenon|phenomena]] were unanticipated. \n \n Since the relation between changes in [[Gibbs free energy]] (''G''), the enthalpy (''H'') and the entropy is \n \n : < math >  \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S \\, < /math > \n \n thus, as ''T'' decreases, \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' approach each other (so long as \u0394''S'' is bounded). Experimentally, it is found that all spontaneous processes (including [[chemical reaction]]s) result in a decrease in ''G'' as they proceed toward [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. If \u0394''S'' and/or ''T'' are small, the condition \u0394''G'' & nbsp; < & nbsp;0 may imply that \u0394''H'' & nbsp; < & nbsp;0, which would indicate an [[exothermic]] reaction. However, this is not required; [[endothermic]] reactions can proceed spontaneously if the ''T''\u0394''S'' term is large enough. \n \n Moreover, the slopes of the [[derivative]]s of \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' converge and are equal to zero at ''T'' & nbsp;= & nbsp;0. This ensures that \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' are nearly the same over a considerable range of temperatures and justifies the approximate [[empiricism|empirical]] Principle of Thomsen and Berthelot, which states that ''the equilibrium state to which a system proceeds is the one that evolves the greatest amount of heat'', i.e., an actual process is the ''most exothermic one''. (Callen, pp. & nbsp;186\u2013187) \n \n One model that estimates the properties of an [[electron]] gas at absolute zero in metals is the [[Fermi gas]]. The electrons, being [[Fermion]]s, must be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical [[velocities]], even at absolute zero. The maximum energy that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the [[Fermi energy]]. The Fermi temperature is defined as this maximum energy divided by Boltzmann's constant, and is of the order of 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero. This explains the failure of the classical [[equipartition theorem]] for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late 19th century. \n \n ==Relation with Bose\u2013Einstein condensate== \n {{Main|Bose\u2013Einstein condensate}} \n \n [[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|left|thumb|Velocity-distribution data of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms at a temperature within a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero.

Under such conditions, a large fraction of the bosons occupy the lowest [[quantum state]] of the external potential, at which point quantum effects become apparent on a [[macroscopic scale]]. < ref > {{cite journal|journal=Nature|volume=412|pages=295\u2013299|year=2001|title=Dynamics of collapsing and exploding Bose\u2013Einstein condensates|pmid=11460153|issue=6844|doi=10.1038/35085500|arxiv = cond-mat/0105019 |bibcode = 2001Natur.412..295D|last1=Donley|first1=Elizabeth A.|last2=Claussen|first2=Neil R.|last3=Cornish|first3=Simon L.|last4=Roberts|first4=Jacob L.|last5=Cornell|first5=Eric A.|last6=Wieman|first6=Carl E.|s2cid=969048}} < /ref > \n \n This state of matter was first predicted by [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] and [[Albert Einstein]] in 1924\u201325.

Absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies the size of the ''degree'', so the ''ratios'' of two absolute temperatures, ''T'' < sub > 2 < /sub > /''T'' < sub > 1 < /sub > , are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]]. It can also be found in [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] (for particles of half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]) and [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]] (for particles of integer spin). All of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing [[exponential function]]s of energy (at the particle level) over ''kT'', with ''k'' representing the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' representing the temperature observed at the [[macroscopic]] level. < ref name= \" sib2115 \" / > \n \n ==Negative temperatures== \n {{Main|Negative temperature}} \n \n Temperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar Celsius or Fahrenheit scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain [[Thermodynamic system|systems]] can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their [[thermodynamic temperature]] (expressed in kelvins) can be of a [[Negative number|negative]] quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than ''any'' system with a positive temperature, in the sense that if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat flows from the negative to the positive-temperature system. < ref name= \" Chase \" > {{cite web|last=Chase|first=Scott|title=Below Absolute Zero -What Does Negative Temperature Mean?|url=http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/mirrors/physicsfaq/ParticleAndNuclear/neg_temperature.html|work=The Physics and Relativity FAQ|access-date=2 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815144418/http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/mirrors/physicsfaq/ParticleAndNuclear/neg_temperature.html|archive-date=15 August 2011|url-status=dead}} < /ref > \n \n Most familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their [[entropy]]. However, some systems have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy, such a system's temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added. < ref name= \" Chase \" / >  As a result, the Boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore, no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures. However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable. \n \n On 3 January 2013, physicists announced that for the first time they had created a quantum gas made up of potassium atoms with a negative temperature in motional degrees of freedom. < ref > {{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.12146|title=Quantum gas goes below absolute zero|journal=Nature|year=2013|last1=Merali|first1=Zeeya|s2cid=124101032}} < /ref > \n \n ==History== \n [[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Robert Boyle]] pioneered the idea of an absolute zero]] \n One of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was [[Robert Boyle]].

His instrument indicated temperatures by the height at which a certain mass of air sustained a column of mercury\u2014the volume, or  \" spring \"  of the air varying with temperature. Amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air was reduced to nothing. He used a scale that marked the boiling point of water at +73 and the melting point of ice at +{{frac|51|1|2}}, so that the zero was equivalent to about \u2212240 on the Celsius scale. < ref name=AS2016 > {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Cold}} < /ref >  Amontons held that the absolute zero cannot be reached, so never attempted to compute it explicitly. < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Talbot |first1=G.R. |last2=Pacey |first2=A.C. |date=1972 |title=Antecedents of thermodynamics in the work of Guillaume Amontons |journal=Centaurus |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=20\u201340 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1972.tb00163.x|bibcode=1972Cent...16...20T }} < /ref > \n The value of \u2212240 & nbsp;\u00b0C, or  \" 431 divisions [in Fahrenheit's thermometer] below the cold of freezing water \" < ref > {{Google books|tSm2Ws6bg0oC|Essays Medical and Philosophical|page=PA291}} < /ref >  was published by [[George Martine (physician)|George Martine]] in 1740. \n \n This close approximation to the modern value of \u2212273.15 & nbsp;\u00b0C < ref name= \" sib2115 \" / >  for the zero of the air thermometer was further improved upon in 1779 by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], who observed that {{convert|-270|C|F K}} might be regarded as absolute cold. < ref > {{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Johann Heinrich|title=Pyrometrie|location=Berlin|year=1779|oclc=165756016}} < /ref > \n \n Values of this order for the absolute zero were not, however, universally accepted about this period. [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], in their 1780 treatise on heat, arrived at values ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 below the freezing point of water, and thought that in any case it must be at least 600 below.
