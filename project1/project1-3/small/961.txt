The RABDF has responsibility for several different roles: internal security, prevention of drug smuggling, the protection and support of fishing rights, prevention of marine pollution, search and rescue, ceremonial duties, assistance to government programs, provision of relief during natural disasters, assistance in the maintenance of essential services, and support of the police in maintaining law and order. \n \n The RABDF is one of the world's smallest militaries, consisting of 245 personnel. It is much better equipped for fulfilling its civil roles as opposed to providing a deterrence against would-be aggressors or in defending the nation during a war. \n \n ==Organisation== \n [[File:A Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defense Force Coast Guard 380X Defender All-Weather Interceptor high-speed boat breeches the wake of another vessel May 24, 2013, during the maritime operations phase of Tradewinds 130524-N-HP195-034.jpg|thumb|right|200px|380X Defender of the RABDF Coast Guard during the  \" Tradewinds 2013 \"  joint training-exercise]] \n The RABDF consists of four major units: \n *[[Antigua and Barbuda Regiment]] \u2014 comprises four line companies and is the infantry unit and fighting arm of the defence force. \n *Service and Support Unit \u2014 provides administrative, logistic and engineer support to the rest of the defence force. \n *Coast Guard \u2014 the maritime element of the defence force, and is divided into four units: \n **Commanding Officer's Office \n **Engineer Unit \n **Administration Unit \n **Flotilla \u2014 the flotilla is the operational part of the Coast Guard, and consists of the following water-craft: \n ***1 [[Swiftships Shipbuilders]] 19.81-metre Commercial Cruiser-class [[patrol boat]] (P-01 ''Liberta''), in service since 1984 < ref name= \" wertheim \" > {{cite book|last=Wertheim|first=Eric|title=The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World: Their Ships, Aircraft, and Systems|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, MD|date=2007|pages=6|isbn=9781591149552|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJunjRvplU4C|access-date=18 March 2014}} < /ref > \n ***1 [[SeaArk Boats]] Dauntless-class patrol boat (P-02 ''Palmetto''), in service since 1995 < ref name= \" wertheim \" / > \n ***1 [[Point-class cutter]] ([[USCGC Point Steele (WPB-82359)|P-03 ''Hermitage'']]), transferred from the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] in 1998 < ref name= \" wertheim \" / > \n ***1 [[Defender-class boat|Defender 380X-class all-weather interceptor]] (D-8), date of acquisition unknown < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.defenseimagery.mil/imagery.html? & guid=a662ab12031f1d873d887e597b772ed110f362f1|title=130524-N-HP195-034|last=Okula|first=Christopher|date=30 May 2013|publisher=DefenseImagery.mil|access-date=18 March 2014}} < /ref > \n ***2 [[Boston Whaler]] 8.23-metre [[Launch (boat)|launches]] (071 and 072), in service since 1988 < ref name= \" wertheim \" / > \n ***1 [[Zodiac Marine  &  Pool]] 8.23-metre Hurricane-type [[rigid-hulled inflatable boat]] ([[Rigid-hulled inflatable boat|RHIB]]) in service since 1998 < ref name= \" wertheim \" / > \n *Antigua and Barbuda Cadet Corps \n \n ==Former deployments== \n * In 1983, fourteen men of the ''Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force'' were deployed to Grenada during the [[Operation Urgent Fury]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.open.uwi.edu/sites/default/files/bnccde/antigua/conference/papers/phillips.html|title=Dion E.
