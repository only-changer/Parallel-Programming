The middle chronology, however, is under attack, with various scholars arguing strongly in favor of a low(er) chronology and for various reasons.

Together with the fact that the name Akkad is of non-[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] origin, this suggests that the city of Akkad may have already been occupied in pre-Sargonic times. < ref name=wallromana1990/ > < ref > {{citation |last1=Foster |first1=Benjamin R.|editor1-first=Roger S. |editor1-last=Bagnall |title=The Encyclopedia of Ancient History |year=2013 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Chicago |doi=10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah01005 |chapter=Akkad (Agade) |pages=266\u2013267 |isbn=9781444338386}} < /ref > \n \n ===Sargon of Akkad=== \n {{Main|Sargon of Akkad}} \n Sargon of Akkad defeated and captured [[Lugal-zage-si]] in the [[Battle of Uruk]] and conquered his empire. The earliest records in the Akkadian language date to the time of Sargon. Sargon was claimed to be the son of La'ibum or Itti-Bel, a humble gardener, and possibly a [[hierodule]], or priestess to [[Ishtar]] or [[Inanna]]. One legend related to Sargon in Assyrian times says that \n \n {{quote|My mother was a [[changeling]], my father I knew not. The brothers of my father loved the hills. My city is Azurpiranu (the wilderness herb fields), which is situated on the banks of the Euphrates. My changeling mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. She cast me into the river which rose not over me. The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water. Akki, the drawer of water, took me as his son and reared me. Akki the drawer of water, appointed me as his gardener. While I was gardener Ishtar granted me her love, and for four and (fifty?) ... years I exercised kingship. < ref name=Roux / > }} \n \n Later claims made on behalf of Sargon were that his mother was an  \" entu \"  priestess (high priestess). The claims might have been made to ensure a pedigree of nobility, since only a highly placed family could achieve such a position. < ref > {{cite book|last1=Stiebing Jr|first1=H.

The royal cupbearer at this time was in fact a prominent political position, close to the king and with various high level responsibilities not suggested by the title of the position itself. < ref > {{citation|title=Sargon|doi = 10.1163/1574-9347_bnp_e1101500}} < /ref >  This gave him access to a disciplined corps of workers, who also may have served as his first soldiers.

This consolidation of the city-states of Sumer and Akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia. The empire's breadbasket was the rain-fed agricultural system of [[Assyria]] and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production. \n \n Images of Sargon were erected on the shores of the Mediterranean, in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia ([[Assyria]]/[[Subartu]]) were also subjugated, and rebellions in [[Sumer]] were put down. Contract tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against [[Canaan]] and against [[Sarlak]], king of [[Gutian period|Gutium]]. He also boasted of having subjugated the  \" four-quarters \" & nbsp;\u2014 the lands surrounding Akkad to the north (Assyria), the south (Sumer), the east (Elam), and the west ([[Amorites|Martu]]). Some of the earliest historiographic texts ([[Babylonian Chronicles|ABC 19, 20]]) suggest he rebuilt the city of Babylon (''Bab-ilu'') in its new location near Akkad. < ref > Dalley proposes that these sources may have originally referred to [[Sargon II]] of the Assyria rather than Sargon of Akkad.

He called himself  \" The anointed priest of [[Anu]] \"  and  \" the great'' ensi'' of [[Enlil]] \"  and his daughter, [[Enheduanna]], was installed as priestess to [[Nanna (Sumerian deity)|Nanna]] at the temple in [[Ur]]. \n \n Troubles multiplied toward the end of his reign. A later Babylonian text states: \n {{quote|In his old age, all the lands revolted against him, and they besieged him in Akkad (the city) [but] he went forth to battle and defeated them, he knocked them over and destroyed their vast army.}} \n \n It refers to his campaign in  \" Elam \" , where he defeated a coalition army led by the King of Awan and forced the vanquished to become his vassals. < ref > {{cite book|last1=Stiebing Jr|first1=H.

Traditionally, the ''ensi'' was the highest functionary of the Sumerian [[city-state]]s. In later traditions, one became an ''ensi'' by marrying the goddess Inanna, legitimising the rulership through divine consent. \n \n Initially, the monarchical ''lugal'' (''lu'' = man, ''gal'' =Great) was subordinate to the priestly ''ensi'', and was appointed at times of troubles, but by later dynastic times, it was the ''lugal'' who had emerged as the preeminent role, having his own '' \" \u00e9 \" '' (= house) or  \" palace \" , independent from the temple establishment. By the time of [[Mesalim]], whichever dynasty controlled the city of Kish was recognised as ''\u0161ar ki\u0161\u0161ati'' (= king of Kish), and was considered preeminent in Sumer, possibly because this was where the two rivers approached, and whoever controlled Kish ultimately controlled the irrigation systems of the other cities downstream. \n \n As Sargon extended his conquest from the  \" Lower Sea \"  (Persian Gulf), to the  \" Upper Sea \"  (Mediterranean), it was felt that he ruled  \" the totality of the lands under heaven \" , or  \" from sunrise to sunset \" , as contemporary texts put it. Under Sargon, the ''ensi''s generally retained their positions, but were seen more as provincial governors. The title ''\u0161ar ki\u0161\u0161ati'' became recognised as meaning  \" lord of the universe \" . Sargon is even recorded as having organised naval expeditions to [[Dilmun]] ([[Bahrain]]) and Magan, amongst the first organised military naval expeditions in history. Whether he also did in the case of the Mediterranean with the kingdom of [[Keftiu|Kaptara]] (possibly [[Cyprus]]), as claimed in later documents, is more questionable. \n \n With Naram-Sin, Sargon's grandson, this went further than with Sargon, with the king not only being called  \" Lord of the Four-Quarters (of the Earth) \" , but also elevated to the ranks of the ''dingir'' (= gods), with his own temple establishment. Previously a ruler could, like [[Gilgamesh]], become divine after death but the Akkadian kings, from Naram-Sin onward, were considered gods on earth in their lifetimes. Their portraits showed them of larger size than mere mortals and at some distance from their retainers. < ref > Leick, Gwendolyn (2001)  \" Mesopotamia: Invention of the City \"  (Penguin Books) < /ref > \n \n One strategy adopted by both Sargon and Naram-Sin, to maintain control of the country, was to install their daughters, Enheduanna and Emmenanna respectively, as high priestess to Sin, the Akkadian version of the Sumerian moon deity, Nanna, at Ur, in the extreme south of Sumer; to install sons as provincial ''ensi'' governors in strategic locations; and to marry their daughters to rulers of peripheral parts of the Empire ([[Urkesh]] and Marhashe). A well documented case of the latter is that of Naram-Sin's daughter Tar'am-Agade at Urkesh. < ref > [http://128.97.6.202/attach/Buccellati%202002%20Taram%20Agade%20Daughter%20of%20Naram%20Sin.pdf] Tar'am-Agade, Daughter of Naram-Sin, at Urkesh, Buccellati, Giorgio and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati, in of Pots and Plans.

Before the Akkadian period, the progressive [[soil salinity|salinisation]] of the soils, produced by poorly drained irrigation, had been reducing yields of [[wheat]] in the southern part of the country, leading to the conversion to more salt-tolerant [[barley]] growing. Urban populations there had peaked already by 2,600 BC, and [[demography|demographic pressures]] were high, contributing to the rise of militarism apparent immediately before the Akkadian period (as seen in the [[Stele of the Vultures]] of [[Eannatum]]). Warfare between city states had led to a population decline, from which Akkad provided a temporary respite. < ref > Thompson, William J. (2003),  \" Complexity, Diminishing Marginal Returns and Serial Mesopotamian Fragmentation, \"  ''Journal of World Systems Research'' < /ref >  It was this high degree of agricultural productivity in the south that enabled the growth of the highest population densities in the world at this time, giving Akkad its military advantage. \n \n [[File:Murex Rimush Louvre AO21404.jpg|thumb|left|Sea shell of a [[murex]] bearing the name of [[Rimush]], king of Kish, {{circa|lk=no|2270}} BC, [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre|Louvre]], traded from the Mediterranean coast where it was used by [[Canaanites]] to make a purple dye.]] \n The [[water table]] in this region was very high and replenished regularly\u2014by winter storms in the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates from October to March and from snow-melt from March to July. Flood levels, that had been stable from about 3,000 to 2,600 BC, had started falling, and by the Akkadian period were a half-meter to a meter lower than recorded previously. Even so, the flat country and weather uncertainties made flooding much more unpredictable than in the case of the Nile; serious deluges seem to have been a regular occurrence, requiring constant maintenance of irrigation ditches and drainage systems. Farmers were recruited into regiments for this work from August to October\u2014a period of food shortage\u2014under the control of city temple authorities, thus acting as a form of unemployment relief. Gwendolyn Leick has < ref > Leick Gwendolyn (2003),  \" Mesopotamia: The invention of the city \"  (Penguin) < /ref >  suggested that this was Sargon's original employment for the king of Kish, giving him experience in effectively organising large groups of men; a tablet reads,  \" Sargon, the king, to whom Enlil permitted no rival\u20145,400 warriors ate bread daily before him \" . < ref > Kramer 1963:324, quoted in Charles Keith Maisels, ''The Emergence of Civilization'' ch.  \" The institutions of urbanism \" , 1990:179. < /ref > \n \n Harvest was in the late spring and during the dry summer months.

For this privilege, they would have to pay a tax in [[wool]], [[meat]], [[milk]], and [[cheese]] to the temples, who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In good years, all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflicts with farmers would result. It would appear that the subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the Empire temporarily overcame this problem, < ref > {{cite book|last1=Bourke|first1=Stephen|title=The Middle East: the cradle of civilization revealed|date=2008|publisher=Thames  &  Hudson|isbn=9780500251478|page=89}} < /ref >  and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region. \n \n ===Foreign trade=== \n [[File:Moyen_Orient_3mil_aC.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Location of foreign lands for the Mesopotamians, including [[Elam]], [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]], [[Dilmun]], [[Marhashi]] and [[Meluhha]].]] \n {{see also|Indus-Mesopotamia relations}} \n As a result, Sumer and Akkad had a surplus of agricultural products but was short of almost everything else, particularly metal ores, timber and building stone, all of which had to be imported.

Her known works include hymns to the goddess [[Inanna]], the ''Exaltation of Inanna'' and ''In-nin sa-gur-ra''. A third work, the ''Temple Hymns'', a collection of specific hymns, addresses the sacred temples and their occupants, the deity to whom they were consecrated. The works of this poet are significant, because although they start out using the third person, they shift to the first person voice of the poet herself, and they mark a significant development in the use of cuneiform. As poet, princess, and priestess, she was a person who, according to William W.

She thereby unites the warlike Akkadian Ishtar's qualities to those of the gentler Sumerian goddess of love and fecundity. She likens Inanna to a great storm bird who swoops down on the lesser gods and sends them fluttering off like surprised bats. Then, in probably the most interesting part of the hymn, Enheduanna herself steps forward in the first person to recite her own past glories, establishing her credibility, and explaining her present plight. She has been banished as high priestess from the temple in the city of Ur and from Uruk and exiled to the steppe. She begs the moon god Nanna to intercede for her because the city of Uruk, under the ruler Lugalanne, has rebelled against Sargon. The rebel, Lugalanne, has even destroyed the temple Eanna, one of the greatest temples in the ancient world, and then made advances on his sister-in-law. < ref > Binkley, Roberta, ''The Importance of Enheduanna'' < /ref > }} \n \n ===Curse of Akkad=== \n [[File:Ishtar on an Akkadian seal.jpg|thumb|Goddess [[Ishtar]] on an Akkadian seal, 2350\u20132150 BC]] \n Later material described how the fall of Akkad was due to Naram-Sin's attack upon the city of Nippur.

Clay seals that took the place of stamps bear the names of Sargon and his son. A [[cadastral]] survey seems also to have been instituted, and one of the documents relating to it states that a certain Uru-Malik, whose name appears to indicate his Canaanite origin, was governor of the land of the Amorites, or ''Amurru'' as the semi-nomadic people of Syria and Canaan were called in Akkadian. It is probable that the first collection of [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations and terrestrial omens was made for a library established by Sargon. The earliest  \" year names \" , whereby each year of a king's reign was named after a significant event performed by that king, date from Sargon's reign. Lists of these  \" year names \"  henceforth became a calendrical system used in most independent Mesopotamian city-states. In Assyria, however, years came to be named for the annual presiding ''[[limmu]]'' official appointed by the king, rather than for an event. \n \n ==See also== \n {{History of Iraq}} \n {{Portal|Asia}} \n * [[Cities of the ancient Near East]] \n * [[Religions of the ancient Near East]] \n * [[History of Mesopotamia]] \n * [[Timeline of the Assyrian Empire]] \n \n {{clear}} \n \n ==Notes== \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n \n === Bibliography === \n * [[Mario Liverani|Liverani, Mario]], ed.
