Their taxonomy puts them in the family Haliotidae, which contains only one genus, ''[[Haliotis]]'', which once contained six subgenera. These subgenera have become alternate representations of ''Haliotis''. < ref name= \" WoRMS \"  / >  The number of species recognized worldwide ranges between 30 < ref name=DCMD > {{harvnb|Dauphin|Cuif|Mutvei|Denis|1989|p=9}} < /ref >  and 130 < ref name=Cox > {{harvnb|Cox|1962|p=8}} < /ref >  with over 230 species-level taxa described. The most comprehensive treatment of the family considers 56 species valid, with 18 additional subspecies. < ref name=GO > {{harvnb|Geiger|Owen|2012}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}} < /ref > \n \n The [[gastropod shell|shells]] of abalones have a low, open spiral structure, and are characterized by several open respiratory pores in a row near the shell's outer edge. The thick inner layer of the shell is composed of [[nacre]] (mother-of-pearl), which in many species is highly [[Iridescence|iridescent]], giving rise to a range of strong, changeable colors, which make the shells attractive to humans as decorative objects, jewelry, and as a source of colorful [[mother-of-pearl]]. \n \n The flesh of abalones is widely considered to be a desirable food, and is consumed raw or cooked by a variety of cultures. \n \n ==Description== \n [[Image:AbaloneInside.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Iridescence|iridescent]] surface inside a [[red abalone]] shell from [[Northern California]] (the adjacent coin is 25 mm in diameter)]] \n \n Abalone vary in size from {{convert|20|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (''[[Haliotis pulcherrima]]'') to {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} while ''[[Haliotis rufescens]]'' is the largest of the genus at {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}}. < ref > {{harvnb|Hoiberg|1993|p=7}} < /ref > \n \n The shell of abalones is [[wikt:convex|convex]], rounded to oval in shape, and may be highly arched or very flattened. The shell of the majority of species has a small, flat [[Spire (mollusc)|spire]] and two to three [[Whorl (mollusc)|whorls]]. The last whorl, known as the [[body whorl]], is [[wikt:auriform|auriform]], meaning that the shell resembles an ear, giving rise to the common name  \" ear shell \" . ''[[Haliotis asinina]]'' has a somewhat different shape, as it is more elongated and distended. The shell of ''Haliotis cracherodii cracherodii'' is also unusual as it has an [[wikt:ovate|ovate]] form, is [[wikt:imperforate|imperforate]], shows an [[wikt:exsert|exserted]] spire, and has prickly ribs. \n \n A [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] cleft in the shell impresses a groove in the shell, in which are the row of holes characteristic of the genus. These holes are respiratory apertures for venting water from the gills and for releasing sperm and eggs into the water column. < ref name=Anderson/ >  They make up what is known as the [[selenizone]], which forms as the shell grows. This series of eight to 38 holes is near the anterior margin. Only a small number is generally open. The older holes are gradually sealed up as the shell grows and new holes form. Each species has a typical number of open holes, between four and 10, in the selenizone. An abalone has no [[Operculum (gastropod)|operculum]]. The [[Aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] of the shell is very wide and [[wikt:nacreous|nacreous]]. < ref name=Anderson > {{cite web |url=http://www.marinebio.net/marinescience/06future/abintro.htm |title=Abalone Introduction |author=Anderson, Jenny |year=2003 |work=Marine Science |accessdate=10 March 2021 }} < /ref > \n \n The exterior of the shell is striated and dull. The color of the shell is very variable from species to species, which may reflect the animal's diet. < ref name=MtSS / >  The iridescent [[nacre]] that lines the inside of the shell varies in color from silvery white, to pink, red and green-red to deep blue, green to purple. \n \n The animal has [[wikt:fimbriated|fimbriated]] head lobes and side lobes that are fimbriated and [[Cirrus (biology)|cirrated]]. The [[radula]] has small median teeth, and the lateral teeth are single and beam-like. They have about 70 [[uncini]], with [[wikt:denticulated|denticulated]] hooks, the first four very large. The rounded foot is very large in comparison to most molluscs. The soft body is coiled around the [[Columella (gastropod)|columellar muscle]], and its insertion, instead of being on the columella, is on the middle of the inner wall of the shell. The [[gill]]s are symmetrical and both well developed. < ref name= \" Tryon \" > {{harvnb|Tryon, Jr.|1880|p=41}} < /ref > \n \n These snails cling solidly with their broad, muscular foot to rocky surfaces at [[Sublittoral zone|sublittoral]] depths, although some species such as ''[[Haliotis cracherodii]]'' used to be common in the [[intertidal zone]]. Abalones reach maturity at a relatively small size. Their [[fecundity]] is high and increases with their size, laying from 10,000 to 11 million eggs at a time. The [[spermatozoa]] are [[wikt:filiform|filiform]] and pointed at one end, and the anterior end is a rounded head. < ref name= \" Tryon1 \" > {{harvnb|Tryon, Jr.|1880|p=46}} < /ref > \n \n The adults provide no further assistance to the [[larva]]e and they are described as [[Marine larval ecology#Larval development strategies|lecithotrophic]]. The adults are [[herbivorous]] and feed with their [[Radula#The seven basic types|rhipidoglossan]] [[radula]] on [[macroalgae]], preferring red or brown algae. \n \n ==Distribution== \n [[File:Abalone Santo Andre Povoa de Varzim.jpg|thumb|Abalone with a live sponge on its shell in [[P\u00f3voa de Varzim]], [[Portugal]]]] \n The haliotid family has a worldwide distribution, along the coastal waters of every continent, except the Pacific coast of South America, the Atlantic coast of [[North America]], the [[Arctic]], and [[Antarctica]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Anon|2014g}} < /ref >  The majority of abalone species are found in cold waters, such as off the coasts of New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, Western North America, and Japan. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrjwoUa9YBEC & q=National%20Geographic%20Field%20Guide%20to%20the%20Water's%20Edge & pg=PP1|title=National Geographic Field Guide to the Water's Edge|last=Leatherman|first=Stephen|publisher=National Geographic|year=2012|isbn=978-1426208683|series=National Geographic Field Guides|pages=93}} < /ref > \n \n ==Structure and properties of the shell== \n The shell of the abalone is exceptionally strong and is made of microscopic [[calcium carbonate]] tiles stacked like bricks. Between the layers of tiles is a clingy protein substance. When the abalone shell is struck, the tiles slide instead of shattering and the protein stretches to absorb the energy of the blow. [[Material science|Material scientists]] around the world are studying this tiled structure for insight into stronger ceramic products such as [[body armor]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Lin|Meyers|2005|p=27  &  38}} < /ref >  The dust created by grinding and cutting abalone shell is dangerous; appropriate safeguards must be taken to protect people from inhaling these particles. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/pulmonary/hypersensitivity-pneumonitis/#table1|title=Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis|website=www.clevelandclinicmeded.com|access-date=2018-01-17}} < /ref > \n \n ==Diseases and pests== \n Abalones are subject to various diseases. The [[Department of Primary Industries (Victoria)|Victorian Department of Primary Industries]] said in 2007 that [[abalone viral ganglioneuritis|ganglioneuritis]] killed up to 90% of stock in affected regions. Abalone are also severe [[Haemophilia|hemophiliacs]] as their fluids will not clot in the case of a laceration or puncture wound.

The meat of this mollusc is considered a [[delicacy]] in certain parts of [[Latin America]] (particularly [[Chile]]), [[France]], [[New Zealand]], [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. In the Greater China region and among Overseas Chinese communities, abalone is commonly known as ''bao yu'', and sometimes forms part of a Chinese banquet. In the same way as [[shark fin soup]] or [[bird's nest soup]], abalone is considered a [[luxury item]], and is traditionally reserved for special occasions such as weddings and other celebrations.{{cn|date=May 2021}} \n \n As abalone became more popular and less common, the prices adjusted accordingly. In the 1920s, a restaurant-served portion of abalone, about 4 ounces, would cost (in inflation adjusted dollars) about US$7; by 2004, the price had risen to US$75. < ref > {{harvnb|Jones|2008|p=65}} < /ref >  In the United States, prior to this time, abalone was predominantly eaten, gathered, and prepared by Chinese immigrants. < ref > {{harvnb|Jones|2008|p=66}} < /ref >  Before that, abalone were collected to be eaten, and used for other purposes by Native American tribes. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Seaweed, Salmon, and Manzanita Cider: A California Indian Feast|last=Dubin|first=Margaret|publisher=Heyday Books|year=2008|editor-last=Tolley|editor-first=Sara-Larus}} < /ref >  By 1900, laws were passed in California to outlaw the taking of abalone above the intertidal zone. This forced the Chinese out of the market and the Japanese perfected diving, with or without gear, to enter the market. Abalone started to become popular in the USA after the [[Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition]] in 1915, which exhibited 365 varieties of fish with cooking demonstrations, and a 1300-seat dining hall. < ref > {{harvnb|Jones|2008|p=70}} < /ref > \n \n In Japan, live and raw abalones are used in awabi sushi, or served steamed, salted, boiled, chopped, or simmered in [[soy sauce]]. Salted, fermented abalone entrails are the main component of ''tottsuru'', a local dish from Honsh\u016b. ''Tottsuru'' is mainly enjoyed with sake. < ref > {{harvnb|Akimichi|1999}} < /ref > \n \n In California, abalone meat can be found on pizza, saut\u00e9ed with caramelized mango, or in steak form dusted with cracker meal and flour. < ref > {{harvnb|Gayot|2010}} < /ref > \n \n ===Sport harvesting=== \n \n ====Australia==== \n [[Tasmania]] supplies about 25% of the yearly world abalone harvest. < ref > {{harvnb|Anon|2014}} < /ref >  Around 12,500 Tasmanians recreationally fish for [[Haliotis rubra|blacklip]] and [[Haliotis laevigata|greenlip]] abalone.

The state is sectioned into three fishing zones, Eastern, Central and Western, with each fisher required a zone-allocated licence. Harvesting is performed by divers using surface-supplied air  \" hookah \"  systems operating from runabout-style, outboard-powered boats. While the diver seeks out colonies of abalone amongst the reef beds, the deckhand operates the boat, known as working  \" live \"  and stays above where the diver is working. Bags of abalone pried from the rocks are brought to the surface by the diver or by way of  \" shot line \" , where the deckhand drops a weighted rope for the catch bag to be connected then retrieved. Divers measure each abalone before removing from the reef and the deckhand remeasures each abalone and removes excess weed growth from the shell. Since 2002, the Victorian industry has seen a significant decline in catches, with the total allowable catch reduced from 1440 to 787 tonnes for the 2011/12 [[fishing year]], due to dwindling stocks and most notably the abalone virus [[ganglioneuritis]], which is fast-spreading and lethal to abalone stocks. \n \n ====United States==== \n [[File:Workers drying abalone shells in the sun in southern California (CHS-1399).jpg|thumb|Workers drying abalone shells in the sun in southern California, ''circa'' 1900]] \n [[File:Japanese Abalone Diver.jpg|thumb|A young Japanese Abalone Diver in California in 1905]] \n [[Image:White abalone Haliotis sorenseni.jpg|thumb|right|Two highly endangered white abalone: Prohibitions on commercial and recreational harvest of this species have been  \n in place since 1996.]] \n Sport harvesting of [[red abalone]] is permitted with a California fishing license and an abalone stamp card.

Only red abalone may be taken, as [[Black abalone|black]], [[White abalone|white]], [[Haliotis corrugata|pink]], [[Haliotis walallensis|flat]], [[Green abalone|green]], and [[Northern abalone|pinto]] abalone are protected by law. < ref name=cal15c/ >  In 2018, The [[California Fish and Game Commission]] closed recreational abalone season due to dramatically declining populations. That year, they extended the moratorium to last through April, 2021. < ref > {{cite news |last=Duggan |first=Tara |date=2018-12-13 |title=California abalone season sunk until 2021 to give stressed population time to rebuild |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/article/No-abalone-diving-allowed-in-California-until-2021-13460882.php |work=San Francisco Chronicle |location=San Francisco, California |access-date=2018-03-26 }} < /ref > \n \n An abalone diver is normally equipped with a thick [[wetsuit]], including a hood, [[Wetsuit boots|bootee]]s, and gloves, and usually also a mask, [[Snorkeling|snorkel]], [[Diving weighting system#Weight belt|weight belt]], abalone iron, and abalone gauge. Alternatively, the rock picker can feel underneath rocks at low tides for abalone. Abalone are mostly taken in depths from a few inches up to {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}; less common are freedivers who can work deeper than {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Abalone are normally found on rocks near food sources such as [[kelp]]. An abalone iron is used to pry the abalone from the rock before it has time to fully clamp down. Divers dive from boats, kayaks, tube floats, or directly off the shore. < ref name= \" ReferenceA \" / > \n \n The largest abalone recorded in California is {{convert|12.34|in|cm|abbr=on}}, caught by John Pepper somewhere off the coast of [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]] in September 1993. < ref name= \" Smookler2005p76 \" > {{harvnb|Smookler|2005|p=76}} < /ref > \n \n The mollusc ''[[Concholepas concholepas]]'' is often sold in the United States under the name  \" Chilean abalone \" , though it is not an abalone, but a [[Muricidae|muricid]]. \n \n ====New Zealand==== \n {{Main|Paua}} \n In New Zealand, abalone is called ''paua'' ({{IPAc-en|'|p|a\u028a|\u0259}}, from the [[M\u0101ori language]]). ''Haliotis iris'' (or blackfoot ''paua'') is the ubiquitous New Zealand ''paua'', the highly polished nacre of which is extremely popular as souvenirs with its striking blue, green, and purple iridescence. ''[[Haliotis australis]]'' and ''[[Haliotis virginea]]'' are also found in New Zealand waters, but are less popular than ''H. iris''. \n \n Like all New Zealand shellfish, recreational harvesting of ''paua'' does not require a permit provided catch limits, size restrictions, and seasonal and local restrictions set by the [[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Ministry for Primary Industries]] (MPI) are followed. The legal recreational daily limit is 10 per diver, with a minimum shell length of {{convert|125|mm|abbr=on}} for ''H. iris'' and {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} for ''H. australis''. In addition, no person may be in possession, even on land, of more than 20 ''paua'' or more than {{convert|2.5|kg|abbr=on}} of ''paua'' meat at any one time. ''Paua'' can only be caught by free-diving; it is illegal to catch them using scuba gear. \n \n An extensive global black market exists in collecting and exporting abalone meat. This can be a particularly awkward problem where the right to harvest ''paua'' can be granted legally under [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] customary rights. When such permits to harvest are abused, it is frequently difficult to police. The limit is strictly enforced by roving [[Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand)|Ministry for Primary Industries]] fishery officers with the backing of the New Zealand Police.  [[Poaching]] is a major industry in New Zealand with many thousands being taken illegally, often undersized. Convictions have resulted in seizure of diving gear, boats, and motor vehicles and fines and in rare cases, imprisonment. \n \n ====South Africa==== \n The largest abalone in South Africa, ''[[Haliotis midae]]'', occurs along roughly two-thirds of the country's coastline. Abalone-diving has been a recreational activity for many years, but stocks are currently being threatened by [[Illegal fishing in Africa|illegal commercial harvesting]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last1=Plag\u00e1nyi|first1=\u00c9va|last2=Butterworth|first2=Doug|last3=Burgener|first3=Markus|date=2011-01-01|title=Illegal and unreported fishing on abalone\u2014Quantifying the extent using a fully integrated assessment model|journal=Fisheries Research|volume=107|issue=1\u20133|pages=221\u2013232|doi=10.1016/j.fishres.2010.11.005}} < /ref >  In South Africa, all persons harvesting this shellfish need permits that are issued annually, and no abalone may be harvested using scuba gear. \n \n For the last few years, however, no permits have been issued for collecting abalone, but commercial harvesting still continues as does illegal collection by [[Criminal organization|syndicates]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Anon|2007}} < /ref > \n In 2007, because of widespread [[poaching]] of abalone, the South African government listed abalone as an endangered species according to the [[CITES]] section III appendix, which requests member governments to monitor the trade in this species. This listing was removed from CITES in June 2010 by the South African government and South African abalone is no longer subject to CITES trade controls. Export permits are still required, however. \n The abalone meat from South Africa is prohibited for sale in the country to help reduce poaching; however, much of the illegally harvested meat is sold in Asian countries. As of early 2008, the wholesale price for abalone meat was approximately US$40.00 per kilogram. There is an active trade in the shells, which sell for more than US$1,400 per metric tonne. \n \n ==== Channel Islands, Brittany and Normandy ==== \n Ormers (''[[Green ormer|Haliotis tuberculata]]'') are considered a delicacy in the British [[Channel Islands]] as well as in adjacent areas of [[France]], and are pursued with great alacrity by the locals.

No ormers may be taken from the beach that are under {{convert|80|mm|in}} in shell length. Gatherers are not allowed to wear wetsuits or even put their heads underwater.
