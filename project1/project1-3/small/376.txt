It occurs in several allomorphs depending on its phonological environment, assimilating voicing of the previous segment or inserting a [[schwa]] after an alveolar stop: < ref name= \" :02 \"  / > \n \n *as {{IPA|/\u0259d/}} or {{IPA|/\u026ad/}} in verbs whose [[Word stem|stem]] ends with the alveolar stops {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}}, such as 'hunted' {{IPA|/h\u028cnt\u026ad/}} or 'banded' {{IPA|/b\u00e6nd\u026ad/}} \n *as {{IPA|/t/}} in verbs whose stem ends with voiceless phonemes other than {{IPA|/t/}}, such as 'fished' {{IPA|/f\u026a\u0283t/}} \n *as {{IPA|/d/}} in verbs whose stem ends with voiced phonemes other than {{IPA|/d/}}, such as 'buzzed' {{IPA|/b\u028czd/}} \n \n The  \" other than \"  restrictions above commonly occur in allomorphy: if the allomorphy conditions are ordered from most restrictive (in this case, after an alveolar stop) to least restrictive, then the first matching case usually  \" win. \"  Thus, the above conditions could be rewritten as follows: \n \n *as {{IPA|/\u0259d/}} or {{IPA|/\u026ad/}} when the stem ends with the alveolar stops {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}} \n *as {{IPA|/t/}} when the stem ends with voiceless phonemes \n *as {{IPA|/d/}} elsewhere \n \n The {{IPA|/t/}} allomorph does not appear after stem-final {{IPA|/t/}} although the latter is voiceless is then explained by {{IPA|/\u0259d/}} appearing in that environment, together with the fact that the environments are ordered. Likewise, the {{IPA|/d/}} allomorph does not appear after stem-final {{IPA|/d/}} because the earlier clause for the {{IPA|/\u0259d/}} allomorph takes priority; the {{IPA|/d/}} allomorph does not appear after stem-final voiceless phoneme because the preceding clause for the {{IPA|/t/}} takes priority. \n \n Irregular past tense forms, such as  \" broke \"  or  \" was/ were, \"  can be seen as still more specific cases since they are confined to certain lexical items, such as the verb  \" break, \"  which take priority over the general cases listed above. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / > \n \n === Plural Allomorphs === \n The plural morpheme for regular nouns in [[English language|English]], is typically realized by adding an ''s'' or ''es'' to the end of the noun. However, the plural morpheme actually has three different allomorphs: [s], [z], and [\u0259z]. The specific pronunciation that a plural morpheme takes on is determined by the following morphological rules: < ref name= \" :1 \"  / > \n \n * Assume that the basic form of the plural morpheme, /z/, is [z] (ex. bags /b\u00e6gz/) \n * The morpheme /z/ becomes [\u0259z] by inserting an [\u0259] before [z] when a noun ends in a sibilant (ex. buses /b\u028cs\u0259z/) \n * Change the morpheme /z/ to a voiceless [s] when a noun ends in a voiceless sound (ex. caps /k\u00e6ps/) \n \n === Negative Allomorphs === \n In [[English language|English]], the negative prefix ''in'' has three allomorphs: [in], [i\u014b], and [im]. The phonetic form that the negative morpheme /in/ takes on is determined by the following morphological rules: < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Moravcsik|first=Edith|date=2019-11-11|title=Accounting for Variation in Language|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/opli/5/1/article-p369.xml|journal=Open Linguistics|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=369\u2013382|doi=10.1515/opli-2019-0020|s2cid=208141142|doi-access=free}} < /ref > \n \n * the negative morpheme /in/ becomes [in] when preceding an alveolar consonant (ex. intolerant /in'tal\u0259r\u0259nt/) \n * the morpheme /in/ becomes [i\u014b] when preceding a velar consonant (ex. incongruous /i\u014b'k\u0254\u014bru\u0259s/) \n * the morpheme /in/ becomes [im] when preceding a bilabial consonant (ex. improper /im'prap\u0259r/) \n \n ==Suffix Allomorphs in the Sami languages== \n \n The [[Sami languages]] have a [[trochaic]] pattern of alternating stressed and unstressed syllables. The vowels and consonants allowed in an unstressed syllable differ from those allowed in a stressed syllable. Consequently, every suffix and inflectional ending has two forms, and the form that is used depends on the stress pattern of the word it is attached to. For example, in [[Northern Sami]], there is the causative verb suffix ''-hit''/''-ahttit'', where ''-hit'' is selected when it would be the third syllable (and the preceding verb has two syllables), and ''-ahttit'' is selected when it would be the third and fourth syllable (and the preceding verb has three syllables): \n * ''goarru-t'' has two syllables, so when suffixed the result is ''goaru-hi-t''. \n * ''nanosm-it'' has three syllables, so when suffixed the result is ''nanosm-ahtti-t''. \n The same applies to inflectional patterns in the Sami languages as well, which are divided into even stems and odd stems. < ref > {{Cite book|last1=Jeffers|first1=Robert|title=Principles and Methods for Historical Linguistics|last2=Lehiste|first2=Ilse|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|year=1982|isbn=9780262600118}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|title=An Introduction to Language|last2=Rodman|first2=Robert|last3=Hyams|first3=Nina|publisher=[[Wadsworth Cengage Learning]]|year=2003|isbn=9781439082416|pages=268\u2013272|edition=9th}} < /ref > \n \n ==Stem allomorphy== \n Allomorphy can also exist in stems or [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], as in [[Classical Sanskrit]]: < ref name= \" :02 \"  / > \n \n {| class= \" wikitable \" \n |+'''V\u0101k''' (voice) \n |- \n ! \n !'''Singular''' \n !'''Plural''' \n |- \n !

The allomorphs are conditioned by the particular case-marking suffixes. \n \n The form of the stem {{IPA|/va\u02d0k/}}, found in the nominative singular and locative plural, is the etymological form of the morpheme. Pre-Indic palatalization of [[velars]] resulted in the variant form {{IPA|/va\u02d0t\u0361\u0283/}}, which was initially phonologically conditioned. The conditioning can still be seen in the locative singular form for which the {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}} is followed by the high front vowel {{IPA|/i/}}. \n \n However, subsequent merging of {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} into {{IPA|/a/}} made the alternation unpredictable on phonetic grounds in the genitive case (both singular and plural) as well as the nominative plural and instrumental singular. Thus, allomorphy was no longer directly relatable to phonological processes. \n \n Phonological conditioning also accounts for the {{IPA|/va\u02d0\u0261/}} form in the instrumental plural in which the {{IPA|/\u0261/}} assimilates in voicing to the following {{IPA|/b\u02b1/}}. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / > \n \n ==History== \n The term was originally used to describe variations in chemical structure. It was first applied to language (in writing) in 1948, by Fatih \u015eat and Sibel Merve in Language XXIV. < ref > Oxford English Dictionary Online: Entry 50006103.
