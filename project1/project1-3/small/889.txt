  "'''Autpert Ambrose (Ambroise)''' ({{lang-la|'''Ambrosius Autpertus'''}}) (ca. 730 \u2013 784) was a [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Benedictine]] monk. \n \n He became abbot of [[San Vincenzo al Volturno]] in South Italy in the time of [[Desiderius]], king of the [[Lombards]].  Autpert's election as [[abbot]] caused internal dissent at St. Vicenzo, and both [[Pope Stephen III]] and [[Charlemagne]] intervened.  The disagreement was based both on objections to Autpert's personality and to his Frankish origin. \n \n He wrote a considerable number of works on the Bible and religious subjects generally. Among these are commentaries on the [[Apocalypse]], on the [[Psalms]], and on the [[Song of Solomon]]; ''Lives of Saints Paldo, Tuto and Vaso''; ''[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] of the Virgin''; and a ''Combat between the Virtues and the Vices''. < ref > {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ambrose, Autpert}} < /ref > \n \n In 2009, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] gave a homily about him in Saint Peter's square. In this homily, Autpert's death date is given as 784 (older scholarship had given a date between 778 and 779). < ref > [http://www.zenit.org/article-25689?l=english On Ambrose Autpert,  \" 1st Mariologist of the West \" ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427023703/http://www.zenit.org/article-25689?l=english |date=April 27, 2009 }} < /ref > \n \n ==References== \n < references/ > \n \n ==External links== \n {{Catholic Encyclopedia poster|Ambrose Autpert}} \n \n {{Authority control}} \n {{DEFAULTSORT:Ambrose, Autpert}} \n [[Category:730s births]] \n [[Category:784 deaths]] \n [[Category:Frankish Benedictines]] \n [[Category:Year of birth uncertain]] \n [[Category:8th-century Frankish writers]] \n [[Category:8th-century Latin writers]]"
