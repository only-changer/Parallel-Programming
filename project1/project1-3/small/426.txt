Another important use of amaranth throughout [[Mesoamerica]] was in ritual drinks and foods. To this day, [[amaranth grain]]s are toasted much like popcorn and mixed with [[honey]], [[molasses]], or [[chocolate]] to make a treat called {{lang|es|alegr\u00eda}}, meaning  \" joy \"  in Spanish. [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]] described the festivities for the Aztec god {{lang|nci|[[Huitzilopochtli]]|italic=no}}. The Aztec month of {{lang|nci|[[Aztec calendar|Panquetzaliztli]]|italic=no}} (7 December to 26 December) was dedicated to {{lang|nci|Huitzilopochtli|italic=no}}. People decorated their homes and trees with paper flags; ritual races, processions, dances, songs, prayers, and finally [[human sacrifice]]s were held. This was one of the more important Aztec festivals, and the people prepared for the whole month. They fasted or ate very little; a statue of the god was made out of amaranth seeds and honey, and at the end of the month, it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a piece of the god. After the Spanish conquest, cultivation of amaranth was outlawed, while some of the festivities were subsumed into the Christmas celebration. \n \n While all species are believed to be native to the New World, several have been cultivated and introduced to warm regions worldwide.

Most amaranth in American food products starts as a ground flour, blended with wheat or other flours to create cereals, crackers, cookies, bread or other baked products. Despite utilization studies showing that amaranth can be blended with other flours at levels above 50% without affecting functional properties or taste, most commercial products use amaranth only as a minor portion of their ingredients despite them being marketed as  \" amaranth \"  products. < ref > {{Cite web |url=https://www.extension.iastate.edu/alternativeag/cropproduction/amaranth.html |title=Amaranth: Alternative Agriculture |last=Delate |first=Kathleen |publisher=Iowa State University|date=2013}} < /ref > \n < !--original research === Seed flour === \n \n Amaranth seed flour has been evaluated as an additive to wheat flour by food specialists. To determine palatability, different levels of amaranth grain flour were mixed with the wheat flour and baking ingredients (1% salt, 2.5% fat, 1.5% yeast, 10% sugar, and 52\u201374% water), fermented, molded, pan-proofed, and baked. The baked products were evaluated for loaf volume, moisture content, color, odor, taste, and texture. The amaranth-containing products were then compared with bread made from 100% wheat flour. The loaf volume decreased by 40% and the moisture content increased from 22 to 42% with increase in amaranth grain flour. The study found that the sensory scores of the taste, odor, color, and texture decreased with increasing amounts of amaranth. Generally, above 15% amaranth grain flour, significant differences occurred in the evaluated sensory qualities and the high amaranth-containing product was found to be of unacceptable palatability to the population sample that evaluated the baked products. < ref > {{cite journal|title=The effect of amaranth grain flour on the quality of bread|author=Jerome Ayo|doi=10.1081/JFP-100105198|journal=International Journal of Food Properties|year=2001|volume=4|issue=2|pages=341|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/JFP-100105198}} < /ref > \n  -- > \n \n === Leaves, roots, and stems === \n Amaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a [[leaf vegetable]] in many parts of the world.

In the Philippines, the [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] word for the plant is {{lang|ilo|kalunay}}; the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for the plant is {{lang|tg|kilitis}} or {{lang|tg|kulitis}}. In [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]] in India, it is called ''{{lang|hi-Latn|chaulai}}'' and is a popular red leafy vegetable (referred to in the class of vegetable preparations called ''{{lang|hi-Latn|laal [[saag]]}}''). It is called ''chua'' in Kumaun area of Uttarakhand, where it is a popular red-green vegetable. In [[Karnataka]] in India, it is called ''{{lang|kn-Latn|harive soppu}} ({{lang|kn|\u0cb9\u0cb0\u0cbf\u0cb5\u0cc6 \u0cb8\u0cca\u0caa\u0ccd\u0caa\u0cc1}})'' . It is used to prepare curries such as ''hulee, palya, majjigay-hulee'', and so on. In Kerala, it is called ''cheera'' and is consumed by stir-frying the leaves with spices and red chili peppers to make a dish called ''cheera [[thoran]]''. In Tamil Nadu, it is called ''{{lang|ta-Latn|mulaikkira}}'' and is regularly consumed as a favourite dish, where the greens are steamed and mashed with light seasoning of salt, red chili pepper, and cumin. It is called ''{{lang|ta-Latn|keerai masial}}''. In ''Andhra Pradesh'', this leaf is added in preparation of a popular ''[[dal]]'' called {{lang|te|thotakura pappu}} in ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]). In Maharashtra, it is called ''{{lang|mr-Latn|shravani maath}}'' and is available in both red and white colour. In Orissa, it is called ''{{lang|or-Latn|khada saga}}'', it is used to prepare ''{{lang|or-Latn|saga bhaja}}'', in which the leaf is fried with chili and onions. \n \n In China, the leaves and stems are used as a stir-fry vegetable, or in soups. In Vietnam, it is called {{lang|vi|rau d\u1ec1n}} and is used to make [[soup]]. Two species are popular as edible vegetable in Vietnam: {{lang|vi|d\u1ec1n \u0111\u1ecf}} (''Amaranthus tricolor'') and {{lang|vi|d\u1ec1n c\u01a1m}} or {{lang|vi|d\u1ec1n tr\u1eafng}} (''Amaranthus viridis''). \n \n A traditional food plant in Africa, amaranth has the potential to improve nutrition, boost [[food security]], foster rural development and support sustainable land care. < ref > {{cite book |author=National Research Council |title=Lost Crops of Africa: Volume II: Vegetables |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763 |access-date=2008-07-15 |series=Lost Crops of Africa |volume=2 |date=2006-10-27 |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=978-0-309-10333-6 |oclc=34344933 |doi= 10.17226/11763|chapter=Amaranth |chapter-url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763 & page=35 }} < /ref > \n \n In Bantu regions of Uganda and western Kenya, it is known as ''doodo'' or ''litoto''. < ref > {{cite book | author=Goode, P.

In the Caribbean, the leaves are called ''bhaji'' in Trinidad and ''callaloo'' in Jamaica, and are saut\u00e9ed with onions, garlic, and tomatoes, or sometimes used in a soup called pepperpot soup.
