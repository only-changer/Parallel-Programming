Frequently, the diagnosis is based on clinical findings (i.e. LMN vs. UMN signs and symptoms, patterns of weakness), family history of MND, and a variation of tests, many of which are used to rule out disease mimics, which can manifest with identical symptoms.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} \n \n === Classification === \n [[File:UMN vs LMN.png|thumb|296x296px|'''Corticospinal tract.''' Upper motor neurons originating in the primary motor cortex synapse to either lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the central gray matter of the spinal cord (insert) or brainstem motor neurons (not shown). Motor neuron disease can affect either upper motor neurons (UMNs) or lower motor neurons (LMNs).]] \n Motor neuron disease describes a collection of clinical disorders, characterized by progressive muscle weakness and the degeneration of the motor neuron on [[Electrophysiological techniques for clinical diagnosis|electrophysiological testing]]. As discussed above, the term  \" motor neuron disease \"  has varying meanings in different countries. Similarly, the literature inconsistently classifies which degenerative motor neuron disorders can be included under the umbrella term  \" motor neuron disease \" . The four main types of MND are marked (*) in the table below. < ref name= \" :8 \" > {{Cite web|url=http://www.mndnsw.asn.au/about-mnd/what-is-mnd/44-mndforms.html|title=What forms does MND take?|website=www.mndnsw.asn.au|access-date=2018-12-11}} < /ref > \n \n All types of MND can be differentiated by two defining characteristics: < ref name= \" :7 \"  / > \n \n # Is the disease sporadic or inherited? \n # Is there involvement of the [[upper motor neuron]]s (UMN), the [[lower motor neuron]]s (LMN), or both? \n \n Sporadic or acquired MNDs occur in patients with no family history of degenerative motor neuron disease. Inherited or genetic MNDs adhere to one of the following inheritance patterns: [[autosomal dominant]], [[Autosomal Recessive|autosomal recessive]], or [[X-linked]]. Some disorders, like ALS, can occur sporadically (85%) or can have a genetic cause (15%) with the same clinical symptoms and progression of disease. < ref name= \" :7 \"  / > \n \n UMNs are motor neurons that project from the cortex down to the brainstem or spinal cord. < ref name= \" :4 \" > {{Cite book|title=Neuroanatomy through clinical cases|first=Hal |last=Blumenfeld | name-list-style = vanc |date=2002 |publisher=Sinauer |isbn=087893060-4|location=Sunderland, Mass.|oclc=44628054}} < /ref >  LMNs originate in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and synapse on peripheral muscles. < ref name= \" :4 \"  / >  Both motor neurons are necessary for the strong contraction of a muscle, but damage to an UMN can be distinguished from damage to a LMN by physical exam. \n \n {| class= \" wikitable \" \n  !
