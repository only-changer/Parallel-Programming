They are the [[convex polytope|convex]] [[Uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedra]] composed of [[regular polygon]]s meeting in identical [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]], excluding the five [[Platonic solid]]s (which are composed of only one type of polygon) and excluding the [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]] and [[antiprism]]s. They differ from the [[Johnson solid]]s, whose regular polygonal faces do not meet in identical vertices. \n \n \" Identical vertices \"  means that each two vertices are symmetric to each other: A global [[isometry]] of the entire solid takes one vertex to the other while laying the solid directly on its initial position. {{harvs|first=Branko|last=Gr\u00fcnbaum|authorlink=Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum|year=2009|txt}} observed that a 14th polyhedron, the [[elongated square gyrobicupola]] (or pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron), meets a weaker definition of an Archimedean solid, in which  \" identical vertices \"  means merely that the faces surrounding each vertex are of the same types (i.e. each vertex looks the same from close up), so only a local isometry is required. Gr\u00fcnbaum pointed out a frequent error in which authors define Archimedean solids using this local definition but omit the 14th polyhedron. If only 13 polyhedra are to be listed, the definition must use global symmetries of the polyhedron rather than local neighborhoods. \n \n [[Prism (geometry)|Prisms]] and [[antiprism]]s, whose [[symmetry group]]s are the [[dihedral group]]s, are generally not considered to be Archimedean solids, even though their faces are regular polygons and their symmetry groups act transitively on their vertices. Excluding these two infinite families, there are 13 Archimedean solids. All the Archimedean solids (but not the elongated square gyrobicupola) can be made via [[Wythoff construction]]s from the Platonic solids with [[Tetrahedral symmetry|tetrahedral]], [[Octahedral symmetry|octahedral]] and [[icosahedral symmetry]]. \n \n ==Origin of name== \n The Archimedean solids take their name from [[Archimedes]], who discussed them in a now-lost work. [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] refers to it, stating that Archimedes listed 13 polyhedra. < ref name= \" g09 \" > {{harvtxt|Gr\u00fcnbaum|2009}}. < /ref >  During the [[Renaissance]], [[artist]]s and [[mathematician]]s valued ''pure forms'' with high symmetry, and by around 1620 [[Johannes Kepler]] had completed the rediscovery of the 13 polyhedra, < ref > Field J., Rediscovering the Archimedean Polyhedra: Piero della Francesca, Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Daniele Barbaro, and Johannes Kepler, ''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'', '''50''', 1997, 227 < /ref >  as well as defining the [[prism (geometry)|prisms]], [[antiprisms]], and the non-convex solids known as [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]]. (See {{harvnb|Schreiber|Fischer|Sternath|2008}} for more information about the rediscovery of the Archimedean solids during the renaissance.) \n \n Kepler may have also found the [[elongated square gyrobicupola]] (pseudorhombicuboctahedron): at least, he once stated that there were 14 Archimedean solids. However, his published enumeration only includes the 13 uniform polyhedra, and the first clear statement of the pseudorhombicuboctahedron's existence was made in 1905, by [[Duncan Sommerville]]. < ref name= \" g09 \" / > \n \n ==Classification== \n There are 13 Archimedean solids (not counting the [[elongated square gyrobicupola]]; 15 if the [[mirror image]]s of two [[chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphs]], the snub cube and snub dodecahedron, are counted separately). \n \n Here the ''vertex configuration'' refers to the type of regular polygons that meet at any given vertex. For example, a [[vertex configuration]] of (4,6,8) means that a [[square]], [[hexagon]], and [[octagon]] meet at a vertex (with the order taken to be clockwise around the vertex). \n \n {| class= \" wikitable sortable \"  style= \" text-align:center \" \n |- \n !

Together with the [[bipyramid]]s and [[trapezohedron|trapezohedra]], these are the [[face-uniform]] solids with regular vertices. \n \n === Chirality === \n \n The snub cube and snub dodecahedron are known as ''[[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]]'', as they come in a left-handed form (Latin: levomorph or laevomorph) and right-handed form (Latin: dextromorph). When something comes in multiple forms which are each other's three-dimensional [[mirror image]], these forms may be called enantiomorphs.  (This nomenclature is also used for the forms of certain [[chemical compound]]s.) \n \n == Construction of Archimedean solids == \n {{Further|Uniform polyhedron|Conway polyhedron notation}} \n [[File:Polyhedron truncation example3.png|thumb|The Archimedean solids can be constructed as [[uniform polyhedron#Convex forms by Wythoff construction|generator positions in a kaleidoscope]].]] \n \n The different Archimedean and Platonic solids can be related to each other using a handful of general constructions.  Starting with a Platonic solid, [[truncation (geometry)|truncation]] involves cutting away of corners.  To preserve symmetry, the cut is in a plane perpendicular to the line joining a corner to the center of the polyhedron and is the same for all corners.  Depending on how much is truncated (see table below), different Platonic and Archimedean (and other) solids can be created. If the truncation is exactly deep enough such that each pair of faces from adjacent vertices shares exactly one point, it is known as a rectification. An [[expansion (geometry)|expansion]], or [[cantellation]], involves moving each face away from the center (by the same distance so as to preserve the symmetry of the Platonic solid) and taking the convex hull.  Expansion with twisting also involves rotating the faces, thus splitting each rectangle corresponding to an edge into two triangles by one of the diagonals of the rectangle.  The last construction we use here is truncation of both corners and edges.  Ignoring scaling, expansion can also be viewed the rectification of the rectification. Likewise, the cantitruncation can be viewed as the truncation of the rectification. \n {{Clear|left}} \n {| class= \" wikitable \" \n |+ Construction of Archimedean Solids \n !colspan=2|Symmetry \n ![[Tetrahedral symmetry|Tetrahedral]] < BR > [[File:Tetrahedral reflection domains.png|120px]] \n !colspan=2|[[Octahedral symmetry|Octahedral]] < BR > [[File:Octahedral reflection domains.png|120px]] \n !colspan=2|[[Icosahedral symmetry|Icosahedral]] < BR > [[File:Icosahedral reflection domains.png|120px]] \n |- \n !

(All Platonic solids have at least tetrahedral symmetry, as tetrahedral symmetry is a symmetry operation of (i.e. is included in) octahedral and isohedral symmetries, which is demonstrated by the fact that an octahedron can be viewed as a rectified tetrahedron, and an icosahedron can be used as a snub tetrahedron.) \n \n ==Stereographic projection== \n {|class=wikitable \n |- align=center valign=top \n !colspan=2|[[truncated tetrahedron]]||colspan=2|[[truncated cube]]||colspan=2|[[truncated octahedron]]||colspan=2|[[truncated dodecahedron]]||colspan=2|[[truncated icosahedron]] \n |- \n |[[Image:truncated tetrahedron stereographic projection triangle.png|160px]] < br > [[triangle]]-centered \n |[[Image:truncated tetrahedron stereographic projection hexagon.png|160px]] < br > [[hexagon]]-centered \n |[[Image:truncated cube stereographic projection octagon.png|160px]] < br > [[octagon]]-centered \n |[[Image:truncated cube stereographic projection triangle.png|160px]] < br > [[triangle]]-centered \n |[[Image:truncated octahedron stereographic projection square.png|160px]] < br/ > [[square]]-centered \n |[[Image:truncated octahedron stereographic projection hexagon.png|160px]] < br/ > [[hexagon]]-centered \n |[[Image:truncated dodecahedron stereographic projection decagon.png|160px]] < br > [[Decagon]]-centered \n |[[Image:truncated dodecahedron stereographic projection triangle.png|160px]] < br > [[Triangle]]-centered \n |[[File:Truncated icosahedron stereographic projection pentagon.png|160px]] < br > [[pentagon]]-centered \n |[[File:Truncated icosahedron stereographic projection hexagon.png|160px]] < br > [[hexagon]]-centered \n \n |- \n |} \n \n {|class=wikitable \n |- \n !colspan=3|[[cuboctahedron]]||colspan=2|[[icosidodecahedron]]||colspan=3|[[rhombicuboctahedron]]||colspan=3|[[rhombicosidodecahedron]]||colspan=3| \n |- align=center valign=top \n |[[File:cuboctahedron stereographic projection square.png|155px]] < br > [[square]]-centered \n |[[File:cuboctahedron stereographic projection triangle.png|160px]] < br > [[triangle]]-centered \n |[[File:Cuboctahedron_stereographic_projection_vertex.png|160px]] < br > [[vertex]]-centered \n |[[Image:icosidodecahedron stereographic projection pentagon.png|160px]] < br > [[pentagon]]-centered \n |[[Image:icosidodecahedron stereographic projection triangle.png|160px]] < br > [[triangle]]-centered \n |[[File:rhombicuboctahedron stereographic projection square.png|160px]] < br > [[square]]-centered \n |[[File:Rhombicuboctahedron stereographic projection square2.png|160px]] < br > [[square]]-centered \n |[[File:rhombicuboctahedron stereographic projection triangle.png|160px]] < br >  [[triangle]]-centered \n |[[Image:rhombicosidodecahedron stereographic projection pentagon'.png|160px]] < br > [[Pentagon]]-centered \n |[[Image:rhombicosidodecahedron stereographic projection triangle.png|160px]] < br > [[Triangle]]-centered \n |[[Image:rhombicosidodecahedron stereographic projection square.png|160px]] < br > [[Square]]-centered \n \n |} \n \n {|class=wikitable \n |- align=center valign=top \n !colspan=3|[[truncated cuboctahedron]]||colspan=3|[[truncated icosidodecahedron]]||[[snub cube]] \n |- \n |[[Image:truncated cuboctahedron stereographic projection square.png|165px]] < br > [[square]]-centered \n |[[Image:truncated cuboctahedron stereographic projection hexagon.png|152px]] < br > [[hexagon]]-centered \n |[[Image:truncated cuboctahedron stereographic projection octagon.png|160px]] < br > [[octagon]]-centered \n |[[Image:Truncated icosidodecahedron stereographic projection decagon.png|160px]] \n |[[Image:Truncated icosidodecahedron stereographic projection hexagon.png|168px]] \n |[[Image:Truncated icosidodecahedron stereographic projection square.png|172px]] \n |[[File:Snub_cube_stereographic_projection.png|160px]] < br > [[square]]-centered \n |- \n |} \n \n == See also == \n * [[Aperiodic tiling]] \n * [[Archimedean graph]] \n * [[Icosahedral twins]] \n * [[List of uniform polyhedra]] \n * [[Prince Rupert's cube#Generalizations]] \n * [[Quasicrystal]] \n * [[Regular polyhedron]] \n * [[Semiregular polyhedron]] \n * [[Toroidal polyhedron]] \n * [[Uniform polyhedron]] \n \n == Citations == \n {{reflist}} \n \n == General references == \n *{{citation \n  | last = Gr\u00fcnbaum | first = Branko \n  | doi = 10.4171/EM/120 \n  | issue = 3 \n  | journal = Elemente der Mathematik \n  | mr = 2520469 \n  | pages = 89\u2013101 \n  | title = An enduring error \n  | volume = 64 \n  | year = 2009| doi-access = free \n  }}.
