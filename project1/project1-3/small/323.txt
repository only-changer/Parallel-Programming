His television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several film productions including ''[[La Gran Fiesta]]'', ''[[Gaby: A True Story]]'' and ''[[Romero (film)|Romero]]'', and in 1991 he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment. \n \n In 1991, Cuaron directed ''[[S\u00f3lo con tu pareja]]'', a sex comedy about a womanizing businessman (played by [[Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho]]) who, after having sex with an attractive nurse, is fooled into believing he's contracted [[AIDS]].

After this success, director [[Sydney Pollack]] hired Cuar\u00f3n to direct an episode of ''[[Fallen Angels (American TV series)|Fallen Angels]]'', a series of [[neo-noir]] stories produced for the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] premium cable network in 1993; other directors who worked on the series included [[Steven Soderbergh]], [[Jonathan Kaplan]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]], and [[Tom Hanks]]. \n \n In 1995, Cuar\u00f3n released his first feature film produced in the United States, ''[[A Little Princess (1995 film)|A Little Princess]]'', an adaptation of [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s classic novel.

It was a provocative and controversial road comedy about two sexually obsessed teenagers who take an extended road trip with an attractive married woman who is much older than them. The film's open portrayal of sexuality and frequent rude humor, as well as the politically and socially relevant asides, made the film an international hit and a major success with critics. Cuar\u00f3n shared an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] with co-writer and brother [[Carlos Cuar\u00f3n]]. \n \n In 2004, Cuar\u00f3n directed the third film in the successful ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''. Cuar\u00f3n faced criticism at the time from some ''[[Harry Potter]]'' fans for his approach to the film, notably its tendency to take more creative liberties with the source material than its predecessors.

Most notable, is the director's use of long takes, and his constantly moving camera. These tendencies create the feeling of real time and real space within the worlds that Cuaron explores in his films. Elaborating on this the director states,\u201c''For Children of Men, we wanted to take advantage of the element of real time. It\u2019s a documentary approach. As if you were just following characters around with your own digital camera in the year 2027.''\u201d This [[Documentary film|documentary]] approach grounds the sometimes fantastical and otherworldly settings the director traverses in films such as ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' and ''Gravity''. In his films, camera movement acts as an extension of character emotion. Whether employing handheld, steadicam or robotic arm, Cuar\u00f3n uses the tools of cinematography to create an intense, symbiotic relationship between viewer and onscreen action. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/alfonso-cuaron-movies/|title=Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's Directing Techniques|last=Vasiliauskas|first=Matt|date=2019-08-12|website=StudioBinder|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-19}} < /ref > \n \n ==Personal life== \n Cuar\u00f3n is a vegetarian < ref name= \" vulture2013 \" > {{ cite web | author = Dan P.
