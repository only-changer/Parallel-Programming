He then comes to the story again as the commander who introduced [[David (biblical king)|David]] to Saul following David's killing of [[Goliath]]. He is not mentioned in the account of the disastrous [[battle of Gilboa]] when Saul's power was crushed. Seizing the youngest but only surviving of Saul's sons, [[Ish-bosheth]], also called Eshbaal, Abner set him up as king over [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]] at [[Mahanaim]], east of the [[Jordan River|Jordan]]. [[David (biblical king)|David]], who was accepted as king by [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] alone, was meanwhile reigning at [[Hebron]], and for some time war was carried on between the two parties. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" > {{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abner|volume=1|page=66}} < /ref > \n \n The only engagement between the rival factions which is told at length is noteworthy, inasmuch as it was preceded by an encounter at [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]] between twelve chosen men from each side, in which the whole twenty-four seem to have perished. < ref > {{bibleverse|2 Samuel|2:12|KJV}} < /ref > {{efn|According to Chisholm (1911), [t]he object of the story of the encounter is to explain the name Helkath-hazzurim, the meaning of which is doubtful (''Ency. Bib.'' col. 2006; Batten in ''Zeit. f. alt-test. Wissens.'' 1906, pp. 90 sqq.).}} In the general engagement which followed, Abner was defeated and put to flight. He was closely pursued by [[Asahel]], brother of [[Joab]], who is said to have been  \" light of foot as a wild roe \" . < ref > {{bibleverse|2 Samuel|2:18|KJV}} < /ref > . As Asahel would not desist from the pursuit, though warned, Abner was compelled to slay him in self-defence. This originated a deadly [[feud]] between the leaders of the opposite parties, for Joab, as next of kin to Asahel, was by the law and custom of the country the avenger of his blood. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  However, according to Josephus, in Antiquities, Book 7, Chapter 1, Joab had forgiven Abner for the death of his brother, Asahel, the reason being that Abner had slain Asahel honorably in combat after he had first warned Asahel and tried to knock the wind out of him with the butt of his spear. However, probably by intervention of God, it went through Asahel. The Bible says everyone stopped and looked. That shows that something like this never happened before. This battle was part of a civil war between David and Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul. After this battle Abner switched to the side of David and granted him control over the tribe of Benjamin. This act put Abner in David's favor. \n \n For some time afterward the war was carried on, the advantage being invariably on the side of David. At length, Ish-bosheth lost the main prop of his tottering cause by accusing Abner of sleeping with [[Rizpah]], < ref > cf. {{bibleverse|2 Samuel|3:7|KJV}} < /ref >  one of Saul's [[concubine]]s, an alliance which, according to contemporary notions, would imply pretensions to the [[throne]]. < ref > cf. {{bibleverse|2 Samuel|16:21|KJV}}ff. < /ref > \n \n Abner was indignant at the rebuke, and immediately opened negotiations with David, who welcomed him on the condition that his wife [[Michal]] should be restored to him. This was done, and the proceedings were ratified by a feast. Almost immediately after, however, Joab, who had been sent away, perhaps intentionally returned and slew Abner at the gate of Hebron. The ostensible motive for the [[assassination]] was a desire to avenge Asahel, and this would be a sufficient justification for the deed according to the moral standard of the time (although Abner should have been safe from such a revenge killing in Hebron, which was a [[Cities of Refuge|City of Refuge]]). The conduct of David after the event was such as to show that he had no complicity in the act, though he could not venture to punish its perpetrators. < ref > {{bibleverse|2 Samuel|3:31-39|KJV}}; cf. {{bibleverse|1 Kings|2:31|KJV}}ff. < /ref > < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / > \n [[File:David and the tomb of Abner.jpg|thumb|David and the tomb of Abner.
