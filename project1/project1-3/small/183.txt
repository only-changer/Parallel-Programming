They have  \" a sense of identity, a sense of historical and religious tradition, a feeling of belonging to a concrete family, place, and region, which are psychologically and culturally beneficial. \"  The harmony of their life checks the encroachments of a fragmented, alienated modern society. \n *Cultivation of the soil  \" has within it a positive spiritual good \"  and from it the cultivator acquires the virtues of  \" honor, manliness, self-reliance, courage, moral integrity, and hospitality. \"  They result from a direct contact with nature and, through nature, a closer relationship to God. The agrarian is blessed in that they follow the example of God in creating order out of chaos. \n \n ==History== \n {{main|History of agrarianism}} \n The philosophical roots of agrarianism include European and Chinese philosophers. The Chinese school of [[Agriculturalism]] (\u519c\u5bb6/\u8fb2\u5bb6) was a philosophy that advocated peasant utopian [[communalism]] and egalitarianism. In societies influenced by [[Confucianism]], the farmer was considered an esteemed productive member of society, but merchants who made money were looked down upon. < ref name= \" wp \" > {{cite book |last= Deutsch |first=Eliot |author2= Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999 | page= 183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}} < /ref >  That influenced European intellectuals like [[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay]], an avid Confucianist and advocate of China's agrarian policies, in forming the French agrarian philosophy of [[physiocracy]]. < ref > L.A.

Part of their motive to do so was Jefferson's fear that the over-industrialization of America would create a class of wage laborers who relied on their employers for income and sustenance. In turn, these workers would cease to be independent voters as their vote could be manipulated by said employers. In order to counter this, Jefferson introduced, as scholar Clay Jenkinson noted,  \" a graduated income tax that would serve as a disincentive to vast accumulations of wealth and would make funds available for some sort of benign redistribution downward \"  and tariffs on imported articles, which were mainly purchased by the wealthy. < ref > Jenkinson, ''Becoming Jefferson's People'', p. 26 < /ref >  In 1811 Jefferson, writing to a friend, explained:  \" these revenues will be levied entirely on the rich... . the rich alone use imported articles, and on these alone the whole taxes of the general government are levied. the poor man ... pays not a farthing of tax to the general government, but on his salt. \" < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-03-02-0439|title=Founders Online: Thomas Jefferson to Tadeusz Kosciuszko, 16 April 1811|website=founders.archives.gov}} < /ref > \n \n ===Agrarian socialism=== \n {{Main|Agrarian socialism}} \n Agrarian socialism is a form of agrarianism that is [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] in nature and seeks to introduce [[Socialism|socialist]] economic systems in their stead. \n \n ====Zapatismo==== \n [[File:Emiliano Zapata4.jpg|right|thumb|[[Emiliano Zapata]] fought in the Mexican Revolution in the name of the Mexican peasants and sought to introduce reforms such as land redistribution.]] \n Notable agrarian socialists include [[Emiliano Zapata]] who was a leading figure in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. As part of the [[Liberation Army of the South]], his group of revolutionaries fought on behalf of the Mexican peasants, whom they saw as exploited by the landowning classes. Zapata published [[Plan of Ayala]], which called for significant land reforms and land redistribution in Mexico as part of the revolution. Zapata was killed and his forces crushed over the course of the Revolution, but his political ideas lived on in the form of [[Zapatismo]]. \n \n Zapatismo would form the basis for [[neozapatismo]], the ideology of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]]. Known as ''Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'' or EZLN in Spanish, EZLN is a [[far-left]] [[libertarian socialist]] political and militant group that emerged in the state of [[Chiapas]] in southmost Mexico in 1994. EZLN and Neozapatismo, as explicit in their name, seek to revive the agrarian socialist movement of Zapata, but fuse it with new elements such as a commitment to indigenous rights and community-level decision making. \n \n [[Subcommander Marcos]], a leading member of the movement, argues that the peoples' collective ownership of the land was and is the basis for all subsequent developments the movement sought to create: < blockquote > \n \u2026When the land became property of the peasants \u2026 when the land passed into the hands of those who work it \u2026 [This was] the starting point for advances in government, health, education, housing, nutrition, women\u2019s participation, trade, culture, communication, and information \u2026[it was] recovering the means of production, in this case, the land, animals, and machines that were in the hands of large property owners.\u201d < ref > See ''The Zapatistas\u2019 Dignified Rage: Final Public Speeches of Subcommander Marcos''.

In 1958 Mao launched the [[Great Leap Forward]], a social and economic campaign which, amongst other things, altered many aspects of rural Chinese life. It introduced mandatory [[collective farming]] and forced the peasantry to organize itself into communal living units which were known as [[people's commune]]s. These communes, which consisted of 5,000 people on average, were expected to meet high production quotas while the peasants who lived on them adapted to this radically new way of life. The communes were run as [[co-operative]]s where wages and money were replaced by work points. Peasants who criticised this new system were persecuted as  \" [[Right-wing politics|rightists]] \"  and  \" [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]] \" . Leaving the communes was forbidden and escaping from them was difficult or impossible, and those who attempted it were subjected to party-orchestrated  \" public [[struggle session]]s, \"  which further jeopardized their survival. < ref > Thaxton, Ralph A. Jr (2008).

However, following the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], Mao had instilled a mass distrust of intellectuals into China, and thus engineers often were not consulted with regard to the new irrigation systems and the wisdom of asking untrained peasants to produce good quality steel from scrap iron was not publicly questioned. Similarly, the experimentation with the crops did not produce results. In addition to this the [[Four Pests Campaign]] was launched, in which the peasants were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until they dropped from exhaustion. This campaign resulted in an ecological disaster that saw an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which was consequently not in danger of being killed by predators. \n \n None of these new systems were working, but local leaders did not dare to state this, instead, they falsified reports so as not to be punished for failing to meet the quotas. In many cases they stated that they were greatly exceeding their quotas, and in turn, the Chinese state developed a completely false sense of success with regard to the commune system. < ref name=hinton1984 > {{Cite book  | last = Hinton | first = William  | author-link = William H.

By 1962, the Great Leap Forward was declared to be at an end. \n \n In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mao once again radically altered life in rural China with the launching of the [[Down to the Countryside Movement]]. As a response to the Great Chinese Famine, the [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Liu Shaoqi]] began  \" sending down \"  urban youths to rural China in order to recover its population losses and alleviate overcrowding in the cities. However, Mao turned the practice into a political crusade, declaring that the sending down would strip the youth of any bourgeois tendencies by forcing them to learn from the unprivileged rural peasants. In reality, it was the Communist Party's attempt to reign in the [[Red Guards]], who had become uncontrollable during the course of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. 10% of the 1970 urban population of China was sent out to remote rural villages, often in [[Inner Mongolia]]. The villages, which were still poorly recovering from the effects of the Great Chinese Famine, did not have the excess resources that were needed to support the newcomers. Furthermore, the so-called  \" [[sent-down youth]] \"  had no agricultural experience and as a result, they were unaccustomed to the harsh lifestyle that existed in the countryside, and their unskilled labor in the villages provided little benefit to the agricultural sector. As a result, many of the sent-down youth died in the countryside. The relocation of the youths was originally intended to be permanent, but by the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party relented and some of those who had the capacity to return to the cities were allowed to do so. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://chineseposters.net/themes/up-to-the-mountains.php|title=Up to the mountains, down to the villages (1968)|website=chineseposters.net|access-date=2019-04-10|archive-date=2019-04-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428210451/https://chineseposters.net/themes/up-to-the-mountains.php|url-status=dead}} < /ref > \n \n In imitation of Mao's policies, the [[Khmer Rouge]] of [[Cambodia]] (who were heavily funded and supported by the People's Republic of China) < ref > {{cite web |url=https://www.visiontimes.com/2018/01/28/how-red-china-supported-the-brutal-khmer-rouge.html |title=How Red China Supported the Brutal Khmer Rouge |last=Burke |first=James |date=28 January 2018 |website=VisionTimes.com |access-date=3 April 2020 }} < /ref >  created their own version of the Great Leap Forward which was known as  \" Maha Lout Ploh \" .

Agrarian parties advocated land reforms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it. They also wanted [[village cooperatives]] to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements. Many peasant parties were also nationalist parties because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity. \n \n Peasant parties rarely had any power before World War I but some became influential in the interwar era, especially in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. For a while, in the 1920s and the 1930s, there was a Green International ([[International Agrarian Bureau]]) based on the peasant parties in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, [[Poland]], and [[Serbia]]. It functioned primarily as an information center that spread the ideas of agrarianism and combating socialism on the left and landlords on the right and never launched any significant activities. \n \n ===Tunisia=== \n \n The [[Farmers' Voice Party]] won a seat in the district of [[Jendouba Governorate|Jendouba]] after the [[2014 Tunisian parliamentary election|parliamentary election of 2014]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031105610/http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-31 }} in Arabic < /ref > \n \n ===Europe=== \n \n ====Bulgaria==== \n In Bulgaria, the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] (BZNS) was organized in 1899 to resist taxes and build cooperatives. BZNS came to power in 1919 and introduced many economic, social, and legal reforms. However, conservative forces crushed BZNS in a 1923 coup and assassinated its leader, [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] (1879\u20131923). BZNS was made into a communist puppet group until 1989, when it reorganized as a genuine party. \n \n ====Czechoslovakia==== \n In [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Republican Party of Agricultural and Smallholder People]] often shared power in parliament as a partner in the five-party p\u011btka coalition. The party's leader, [[Antonin Svehla]] (1873\u20131933), was prime minister several times. It was consistently the strongest party, forming and dominating coalitions. It moved beyond its original agrarian base to reach middle-class voters. The party was banned by the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]] after the [[Second World War]]. < ref > Sharon Werning Rivera,  \" Historical cleavages or transition mode? Influences on the emerging party systems in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. \"  ''Party Politics'' (1996) 2#2 : 177-208. < /ref > \n \n ====France==== \n In [[France]], the [[Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition]] party is a moderate conservative, agrarian party, reaching a peak of 4.23% in the [[2002 French presidential election]]. It would later on become affiliated to France's main conservative party, [[Union for a Popular Movement]]. \n \n ====Ireland==== \n \n In the late 19th century, the [[Irish National Land League]] aimed to abolish landlordism in [[Ireland]] and enable tenant farmers to own the land they worked on. The  \" [[Land War]] \"  of 1878\u20131909 led to the [[Irish Land Acts]], ending [[absentee landlords]] and [[ground rent]] and redistributing land among peasant farmers. \n \n Post-independence, the [[Farmers' Party (Ireland)|Farmers' Party]] operated in the [[Irish Free State]] from 1922, folding into the [[National Centre Party (Ireland)|National Centre Party]] in 1932. It was mostly supported by wealthy farmers in the east of Ireland. \n \n [[Clann na Talmhan]] (Family of the Land; also called the ''National Agricultural Party'') was founded in 1938. They focused more on the poor [[smallholding|smallholders]] of the west, supporting [[land reclamation]], [[afforestation]], [[social democracy]] and [[rates (tax)|rates]] reform. They formed part of the governing coalition of the [[Government of the 13th D\u00e1il]] and [[Government of the 15th D\u00e1il]]. Economic improvement in the 1960s saw farmers vote for other parties and Clann na Talmhan disbanded in 1965. \n \n ====Latvia==== \n In Latvia, the [[Union of Greens and Farmers]] is supportive of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming: Nature is threatened by development, while small farms are threatened by large industrial-scale farms. \n \n ====Lithuania==== \n In Lithuania, as of 2017, the government is led by the [[Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union]], under the leadership of industrial farmer [[Ram\u016bnas Karbauskis]]. \n \n ====Poland==== \n In [[Poland]], the [[Polish People's Party]] traces its tradition to an agrarian party in [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-controlled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician Poland]]. After the fall of the communist regime, PPP's biggest success came in [[1993 Polish parliamentary election|1993 elections]], where it won 132 out of 460 parliamentary seats. Since then, PPP's support has steadily declined, until 2019, when they formed [[Polish Coalition]] with an anti- establishment, direct democracy [[Kukiz'15]] party, and managed to get 8.5% of votes. Moreover, PPP tends to get much better results in local elections. In [[2014 Polish local elections|2014 elections]] they have managed to get 23.88% of votes. \n \n The right-wing [[Law and Justice]] party has also become supportive of agrarian policies in recent years and polls show that most of their support comes from rural areas.{{citation needed|reason=Needs a source. What polls?|date=June 2020}} \n \n ====Romania==== \n In [[Romania]], older parties from [[Transylvania]], [[Moldavia]], and [[Wallachia]] merged to become the [[National Peasants' Party]] in 1926. [[Iuliu Maniu]] (1873\u20131953) was a prime minister with an agrarian cabinet from 1928 to 1930 and briefly in 1932\u20131933, but the [[Great Depression]] made proposed reforms impossible. The [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] dissolved the party in 1947, but it reformed in 1989 after they fell from power. \n \n The [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party|reformed party]], which also incorporated elements of [[Christian democracy]] in its ideology, governed Romania as part of the [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] between 1996 and 2000. \n \n ====Serbia==== \n In Serbia, [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] (1845\u20131926) and his [[People's Radical Party]] dominated Serbian politics after 1903. The party also monopolized power in Yugoslavia from 1918 to 1929. During the dictatorship of the 1930s, the prime minister was from that party. \n \n ====Ukraine==== \n In Ukraine, the [[Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko]] has promised to purify the country of [[Ukrainian oligarchs|oligarchs]]  \" with a [[pitchfork]] \" . < ref name=BBCUE14RPst > [http://www.bbc.com/nes/world-europe-29739514 Ukraine election: What to look for], [[BBC News]] (24 October 2014) < /ref >  The party advocates a number of traditional left-wing positions (a progressive tax structure, a ban on agricultural land sale and eliminating the illegal land market, a tenfold increase in budget spending on health, setting up primary health centres in every village \n < ref name=radppUW > [http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/121957 The Communist Party May Be on Its Last Legs, But Social Populism is Still Alive], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (23 October 2014) < /ref > ), and mixes them with strong nationalist sentiments. < ref > {{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/world/europe/with-stunts-and-vigilante-escapades-a-populist-gains-ground-in-ukraine.html?_r=0 |title=With Stunts and Vigilante Escapades, a Populist Gains Ground in Ukraine|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}} < /ref > \n \n ====United Kingdom==== \n The heyday of British agrarianism was in the 1500s, led by the Tudor royal advisors, who sought to maintain a broad pool of agricultural commoners from which to draw military men, against the interests of larger landowners who sought [[enclosure]] (meaning of common land). This was reversed by Acts of Parliament which effected the latter policy, chiefly in the 1650 to 1800 period.  Politicians standing strongly as reactionaries to enclosure included the [[Levellers]], anti-industrialist [[Luddites]] and, later, radicals such as [[William Cobbett]].  A high level of net self-sufficiency has a strong base in the national policy debate of successive governments, epitomised in successive centuries by [[Peelite]]s, the [[Campaign for Rural England]], and [[local food]] (anti food-miles) advocates. \n \n ===Oceania=== \n \n ====Australia==== \n Historian F.K. Crowley finds that: \n \n {{quote|Australian farmers and their spokesman have always considered that life on the land is inherently more virtuous, as well as more healthy, more important and more productive, than life in the towns and cities....The farmers complained that something was wrong with an electoral system which produced parliamentarians who spent money beautifying vampire-cities instead of developing the interior. < ref > F.K.

The goal was to enhance the status of the graziers (operators of big sheep stations) and small farmers and justified subsidies for them. < ref > Rae Wear,  \" Countrymindedness Revisited, \"  (Australian Political Science Association, 1990) [http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf online edition ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723145257/http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf |date=2011-07-23 }} < /ref > \n \n ====New Zealand==== \n The [[New Zealand Liberal Party]] aggressively promoted agrarianism in its heyday (1891\u20131912). The landed gentry and aristocracy ruled Britain at this time. New Zealand never had an aristocracy but its wealthy landowners largely controlled politics before 1891. The Liberal Party set out to change that by a policy it called  \" [[populism]]. \"  [[Richard Seddon]] had proclaimed the goal as early as 1884:  \" It is the rich and the poor; it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes. That, Sir, shows the real political position of New Zealand. \" < ref > {{cite book |author=Leslie Lipson|title=The Politics of Equality: New Zealand's Adventures in Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oe8jAAAAMAAJ|year=1948|publisher=U. of Chicago Press}} < /ref >   The Liberal strategy was to create a large class of small landowning farmers who supported Liberal ideals. The [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal government]] also established the basis of the later welfare state such as [[old age pensions]] and developed a system for settling industrial disputes, which was accepted by both employers and trade unions. In 1893, it [[women's suffrage in New Zealand|extended voting rights to women]], making New Zealand the first country in the world to [[women's suffrage|do so]]. \n \n To obtain land for farmers, the Liberal government from 1891 to 1911 purchased {{convert|3,100,000|acres|ha}} of Maori land. The government also purchased {{convert|1,300,000|acres|ha}} from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers. The Advances to Settlers Act (1894) provided low-interest mortgages, and the agriculture department disseminated information on the best farming methods. The Liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian, anti-monopoly land policy. The policy built up support for the Liberal Party in rural North Island electorates. By 1903, the Liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organized opposition in Parliament. < ref > James Belich, ''Paradise Reforged: A history of the New Zealanders'' (2001) pp. 39\u201346 < /ref > < ref > Tom Brooking,  \" 'Busting Up' the Greatest Estate of All: Liberal Maori Land Policy, 1891\u20131911, \"  ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (1992) 26#1 pp. 78\u201398 [http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=802 & action=null online] < /ref > \n \n == Back-to-the-land movement == \n Agrarianism is similar to but not identical with the [[back-to-the-land movement]]. Agrarianism concentrates on the fundamental goods of the earth, on communities of more limited economic and political scale than in modern society, and on simple living, even when the shift involves questioning the  \" progressive \"  character of some recent social and economic developments. Thus, agrarianism is not [[industrial farming]], with its specialization on products and industrial scale. < ref > Jeffrey Carl Jacob, ''New Pioneers: The Back-to-the-Land Movement and the Search for a Sustainable Future'' (Penn State University Press. 1997) < /ref > \n \n ==See also== \n {{Portal|Agropedia}} \n {{div col|colwidth=30em}} \n *[[Agrarian Justice]] \n *[[Agrarian socialism]] \n *[[Agrarian society]] \n *[[Agrarian system]] \n *[[Georgism]] \n *[[Jeffersonian democracy]] \n *[[Agroecology]] \n *[[Physiocrats]], 18th-century French thinkers \n *[[International Agrarian Bureau]] \n *[[Nordic agrarian parties]] \n *[[Yeoman]], English farmers \n *[[Permaculture]] \n {{div col end}} \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n \n == Further reading == \n {{further reading cleanup|date=April 2020}} \n {{refbegin|30em}} \n \n === Agrarian values === \n * Brass, Tom.
