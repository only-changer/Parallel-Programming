He ascended to the throne as a [[Minor (law)|minor]]. For the duration of his short reign, the imperial power was ''[[de facto]]'' held by regents. \n \n ==Biography== \n ===Early years=== \n [[Born in the purple]] at [[Constantinople]], Alexios was the long-awaited son of Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (who gave him a name that began with the letter [[alpha]] as a fulfillment of the [[AIMA prophecy]]) and [[Maria of Antioch]]. In 1171 he was [[coronation of the Byzantine emperor|crowned co-emperor]], and in 1175 he accompanied his father at [[Dorylaion]] in Asia Minor in order to have the city rebuilt. On 2 March 1180, at the age of eleven, he was married to [[Agnes of France, Byzantine Empress|Agnes of France]] aged 10, daughter of King [[Louis VII of France]]. She was thereafter known as Anna, < ref name=odb/ > {{rp|64}} and after Alexios' murder three years later, Anna would be remarried to the person responsible, Andronikos, then aged 65. \n \n ===Regency of Maria and Alexios=== \n When Manuel I died in September 1180, Alexios II succeeded him as emperor. At this time, however, he was an uneducated boy with only amusement in mind. The imperial regency was then undertaken by the [[dowager]] empress and the ''[[protosebastos|pr\u014dtosebastos]]'' [[Alexios Komnenos (protosebastos)|Alexios Komnenos]] (a namesake cousin of Alexios II), who was popularly believed to be her lover. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" > {{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alexius II.|volume=1|page=577|first=John Bagnell|last=Bury|author-link=J. B. Bury}} < /ref > < ref name=odb/ > {{rp|64}} \n \n The regents depleted the imperial treasury by granting privileges to Italian merchants and to the Byzantine aristocracy. When [[B\u00e9la III of Hungary]] and [[Kilij Arslan II]] of [[Sultanate of Rum|Rum]] began raiding within the Byzantine western and eastern borders respectively, the regents were forced to ask for help to the pope and to [[Saladin]]. Furthermore, a party supporting Alexios II's right to reign, led by his half-sister [[Maria Komnene (daughter of Manuel I)|Maria Komnene]] and her husband the [[Renier of Montferrat|''caesar'' John]], stirred up riots in the streets of the capital. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / > < ref name=odb/ > {{rp|64}} \n \n The regents managed to defeat the party on April 1182, < ref name=odb/ > {{rp|64}} but [[Andronikos I Komnenos|Andronikos Komnenos]], a first cousin of Manuel I, took advantage of the disorder to aim at the crown. He entered Constantinople, received with almost divine honours, and overthrew the government. His arrival was celebrated by a [[massacre of the Latins]] in Constantinople, especially the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] merchants, which he made no attempt to stop. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / > < ref name=odb/ > {{rp|64}} \n [[File:Byzantium1173.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The Empire in 1180, when Alexios II became Emperor]] \n \n === Regency of Andronikos and death === \n \n On 16 May 1182 Andronikos, posing as Alexios' protector, officially restored him on the throne. < ref name=odb/ > {{rp|64}} As for 1180, the young emperor was uninterested in ruling matters, and Andronikos effectively acted as the [[power behind the throne]], not allowing Alexios any voice in public affairs. One after another, Andronikos suppressed most of Alexios' defenders and supporters: his half-sister Maria Komnene, the ''caesar'' John, his loyal generals [[Andronikos Doukas Angelos]], [[Andronikos Kontostephanos]] and [[John Komnenos Vatatzes]]. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / > < ref name=odb/ > {{rp|64}} \n \n In 1183, Alexios was compelled to condemn his own mother to death. In September 1183, Andronikos was formally proclaimed emperor before the crowd on the terrace of the [[Arslan Hane, Istanbul|Church of Christ of the Chalk\u00e8]]. Probably by the end of the same month, < ref name=odb/ > {{rp|64}} Andronikos ordered Alexios\u2019 assassination; the young emperor was secretly strangled with a bow-string and his body buried in the [[B\u00f3sporos]]. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / > < ref name=odb/ > {{rp|64}} < ref name=NCMH > {{cite book |editor-last1= Luscombe |editor-first1= David| editor-link1= David Luscombe|editor-last2=Riley-Smith |editor-first2=  Jonathan|editor-link2= Jonathan Riley-Smith | last=Magdalino |first=Paul |author-link=Paul Magdalino |year=2008 |chapter=The Byzantine empire, 1118\u20131204|title=[[The New Cambridge Medieval History]], volume IV, c. 1024\u2013c. 1198, Part II|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-41411-1}} < /ref > {{rp|641}} \n \n In the years following Alexios' mysterious disappearance, many young men resembling him tried to claim the throne. In the end, none of those ''[[Pseudo-Alexios II|pseudo-Alexioi]]'' managed to become emperor. < ref name=NCMH/ > {{rp|641\u20132}} \n \n ==Portrayal in fiction== \n Alexios is a character in the historical novel ''Agnes of France'' (1980) by [[Greece|Greek]] writer [[Kostas Kyriazis]]. The novel describes the events of the reigns of Manuel I, Alexios II, and Andronikos I through the eyes of Agnes. \n \n ==Notes== \n {{notelist}} \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist}} \n \n ==Further reading== \n {{Commons category}} \n {{portal|Byzantine Empire}} \n * Harris, Jonathan, ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', Bloomsbury, 2nd ed., 2014. {{ISBN|978-1-78093-767-0}} \n *{{The Empire of Manuel I Komnenos}} \n *{{Citation | last = Plate | first = William | title = Alexios II Komnenos | editor = William Smith | editor-link = William Smith (lexicographer) | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 130 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=acl3129.0001.001;q1=demosthenes;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=145;page=root;view=image}} \n * {{cite book | last = Varzos | first = Konstantinos | script-title=el:\u0397 \u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd |trans-title=The Genealogy of the Komnenoi | location = Thessaloniki | year = 1984 | publisher = Byzantine Research Centre | language = el}}, Vols.
