Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological [[arousal]] or in order to achieve a greater goal such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained in a risky manner. \n \n ==Motivation== \n Adventurous experiences create psychological [[arousal]], < ref > {{citation |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YjcgAn8TfsC & pg=PA187 |title=On the psychobiology of personality |chapter=Sensation Seeking and Participation in Physical Risk Sports |author=M Gom\u00e0-i-Freixanet |year=2004 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-044209-9 |page=187}} < /ref >  which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. [[fear]]) or positive (e.g. [[flow (psychology)|flow]]).  For some people, adventures becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]], in his ''La Condition Humaine'' (1933),  \" If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity? \" .{{full citation needed|date=June 2013}} Similarly, [[Helen Keller]] stated that  \" Life is either a daring adventure or nothing. \" < ref > {{cite book|last=Keller|first=Helen|title=The Open Door|url=https://archive.org/details/opendoor00kell|url-access=registration|year=1957|publisher=Garden City, N.Y.

Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers \u2013 the British adventurer [[Jason Lewis (adventurer)|Jason Lewis]], for example, uses adventures to draw global [[sustainability]] lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. [[Adventure education]] intentionally uses challenging experiences for [[learning]]. \n \n Author [[Jon Levy (behaviorist)|Jon Levy]] suggests that an experience should meet several criteria to be considered an adventure: < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/science-of-the-best-night-ever|title=The Science of the Perfect Night Out|last=Snow|first=Shane|date=2 December 2016|website=GQ|language=en|access-date=10 February 2019}} < /ref > \n \n # Be remarkable\u2014that is, worth talking about \n # Involve adversity or perceived risk \n # Bring about personal growth \n \n ==Mythology and fiction== \n Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[The Odyssey]]''. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/books/review/Mansbach-t.html|title=Odysseus Remixed|author=Adam Mansbach|date=12 February 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite news|author=Richard Jenkyns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/31/reviews/fagles-odyssey.html |title=Heroic Enterprise \u2013 (Book review: The Odyssey translated by Robert Fagles) |newspaper=nytimes.com |date=22 December 1996 |access-date=13 June 2013}} < /ref > < ref > Zweig, P.

Examples include books such as ''[[Hatchet (book)|Hatchet]]'' or ''[[My Side of the Mountain]]''. These books are less about  \" questing \" , such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world. \n \n ===Questing=== \n Many adventures are based on the idea of a quest: the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward, whether it be a skill, prize, treasure or perhaps the safety of a person. On the way, the hero must overcome various obstacles to obtain it's reward.  \n \n ===Video games=== \n {{See also|Adventure game}} \n \n In [[video game culture|video-game culture]], an adventure game is a [[video game]] in which the player assumes the role of a protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and [[puzzle| puzzle-solving]]. < ref > {{cite web| last=Adams | first=Ernest | title=The Designer's Notebook: Three Problems for Interactive Storytellers |date=29 December 1999| url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3414/the_designers_notebook_three_.php | website=[[Gamasutra]] | access-date=9 June 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100510155724/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3414/the_designers_notebook_three_.php| archive-date= 10 May 2010 | url-status= live|p=43}} < /ref >  The [[Video game genres|genre]]'s focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other [[narrative]]-based media, [[literature]] and [[film]], encompassing a wide variety of literary genres. Many adventure games ([[List of text-based computer games|text]] and [[List of graphic adventure games|graphic]]) are designed for a single player, since this emphasis on story and character makes multi-player design difficult. < ref > {{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Joe|title=Game Design Perspectives|chapter=Special Issues in Multi player Game Design|editor=Fran\u00e7ois-Dominic Laram\u00e9e|publisher=Charles River Media|year=2002|isbn=1584500905|p=258}} < /ref > \n \n ==Nonfiction works== \n {{Unsourced section|date=February 2019}} \n From ancient times, travelers and explorers have written about their adventures. Journals which became best-sellers in their day were written, such as [[Marco Polo]]'s journal ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'' or [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Roughing It]]''. Others were personal journals, only later published, such as the journals of [[Meriwether Lewis|Lewis]] and [[William Clark|Clark]] or [[Captain James Cook]]'s journals. There are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question, such as ''[[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]]'' by [[Tom Wolfe]], or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal, such as ''Conquistadors of the Useless'' by [[Lionel Terray]]. Documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well. \n \n ==Adventure sports== \n There are many sports classified as [[adventure game]]s or sports, due to their inherent danger and excitement. Some of these include [[mountain climbing]], [[skydiving]], or other [[extreme sports]]. \n \n ==See also== \n * [[List of genres]] \n * [[Exploration]] \n * [[Tourism]] \n * [[Travel]] \n * [[Sports]] \n * [[Adventure travel]] \n * [[Adventure film]] \n * [[Adventure playground]] \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n \n ==External links== \n {{Commons category|Adventure}} \n {{Wikiquote}} \n * [http://www.en.abenteuer.fak13.uni-muenchen.de/index.html Website of the Research Unit  \" Philology of Adventure \" ]: ongoing research project on the literary history of the adventure pattern \n * [http://theargonauts.com/what-is-an-adventure/ What is an adventure?] A definition of  \" adventure \" ,  \" hero \"  and  \" epic \"  with an illustration of the hero's journey. \n * [[voy:Main Page|Wikivoyage]] \n * Martin Feeney ''Going on a journey: Life in Year 10'' \n \n {{Authority control}} \n \n [[Category:Adventure| ]]"
