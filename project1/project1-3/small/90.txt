One well-known acropolis is the [[Acropolis of Athens]], located on a rocky outcrop above the city of Athens and containing the [[Parthenon]]. \n \n == Use in antiquity == \n [[File:Via Tecta acropolis Pergamum 487 detail.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|View of the Acropolis of [[Pergamon]] in the background, as seen from Via Tecta at the entrance to the [[Asclepeion]].]] \n [[File:AssosBurgberg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Acropolis of [[Assos]]]] \n \n The word ''acropolis'' literally means in [[Greek language|Greek]]  \" upper city, \"  and though associated primarily with the [[Greece|Greek]] cities [[Athens]], [[Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]] (with [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]]), [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] (with [[Cadmea]]), and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] (with its [[Acrocorinth]]), may be applied generically to all such citadels, including Rome, [[Carthage]], [[Jerusalem]], Celtic [[Bratislava]], many in [[Asia Minor]], or even [[Castle Rock, Edinburgh|Castle Rock]] in [[Edinburgh]]. An example in Ireland is the [[Rock of Cashel]]. Acropolis is also the term used by archaeologists and historians for the urban [[Castro culture]] settlements located in Northwestern Iberian hilltops. \n \n The most famous example is the [[Acropolis of Athens]], < ref > {{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404/|title=Acropolis, Athens|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}} < /ref >  which, by reason of its historical associations and the several famous buildings erected upon it (most notably the [[Parthenon]]), is known without qualification as ''the Acropolis''. The Acropolis of Athens achieved its form in the fifth century BC and is currently an archeological site. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >  Although originating in the mainland of Greece, use of the acropolis model quickly spread to Greek colonies such as the [[Dorians|Dorian]] [[Lato]] on [[Crete]] during the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]]. \n \n == Metaphorical use in modern times == \n Because of its classical [[Hellenistic]] style, the ruins of [[Mission San Juan Capistrano|Mission San Juan Capistrano's]] Great Stone Church in [[California|California, United States]] has been called the  \" American Acropolis \" . < ref name= \" Davis \" > {{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Erik|title=The visionary state : a journey through California's spiritual landscape|date=2006|publisher=Chronicle Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0811848353|page=20}} < /ref > \n \n Other parts of the world developed other names for the high citadel or [[alc\u00e1zar]], which often reinforced a naturally strong site. In Central [[Italy]], many small rural [[comune|communes]] still cluster at the base of a fortified habitation known as [[Rocca (fortification)|la Rocca]] of the commune. \n \n The term ''acropolis'' is also used to describe the central complex of overlapping structures, such as plazas and pyramids, in many [[Maya city|Maya cities]], including [[Tikal]] and [[Cop\u00e1n]]. \n \n ==See also== \n *[[Choragic Monument of Thrasyllos]] \n *[[Asklepieion of Athens]] \n *[[Idjang]] \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist}} \n \n ==External links== \n * {{commonsinline}} \n * [http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=2384 The Acropolis of Athens] (Greek Government website) \n * [http://www.ysma.gr/en/ The Acropolis Restoration Project] (Greek Government website) \n * [https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404 UNESCO World Heritage Centre \u2014 Acropolis, Athens] \n * [https://web.archive.org/web/20100507212643/http://www.i-live.gr/news-akropolis-museum-internet/ Acropolis Museum] \n * [http://www.parthenonfrieze.gr The Parthenon Frieze] (Hellenic Ministry of Culture web site) \n * [http://travels.co.ua/engl/greece/athens/acropolis/index.html Acropolis: description, photo album] \n * [https://www.discovergreekculture.com/tours/the-acropolis-a-walk-through-history/ The Acropolis: A Walk Through History] \n \n {{Ancient Greece topics}} \n \n {{Authority control}} \n \n [[Category:Acropoleis in Greece| ]] \n [[Category:Classical studies]] \n [[Category:Ancient Greek architecture]] \n [[Category:Greek culture]] \n [[Category:Archaeological terminology]] \n [[Category:Ancient Greek fortifications]]"
