Real and complex numbers that are not algebraic, such as [[pi|{{pi}}]] and {{mvar|[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]}}, are called [[transcendental number]]s. \n \n The [[set (mathematics)|set]] of complex numbers is [[uncountable set|uncountable]], but the set of algebraic numbers is [[countable set|countable]] and has [[measure zero]] in the [[Lebesgue measure]] as a [[subset]] of the complex numbers. In that sense, [[almost all]] complex numbers are [[transcendental number|transcendental]]. \n \n ==Examples== \n * All [[rational number]]s are algebraic. Any rational number, expressed as the quotient of an [[integer]] {{mvar|a}} and a (non-zero) [[natural number]] {{mvar|b}}, satisfies the above definition because {{math|''x'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is the root of a non-zero polynomial, namely {{math|''bx'' \u2212 ''a''}}. < ref > Some of the following examples come from Hardy and Wright 1972: 159\u2013160 and pp. 178\u2013179 < /ref > \n * [[Quadratic irrational number]]s of a quadratic polynomial {{math|''ax''{{sup|2}} + ''bx'' + ''c''}} with integer coefficients {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}}) are algebraic numbers. If the quadratic polynomial is monic ({{math|''a'' {{=}} 1}}), the roots are further qualified as [[quadratic integer]]s. \n * A [[constructible number]] can be constructed from a given unit length using a straightedge and compass. It includes all quadratic irrational roots, all rational numbers, and all numbers that can be formed from these using the [[Arithmetic#Arithmetic operations|basic arithmetic operations]] and the extraction of square roots. (By designating cardinal directions for 1, \u22121, {{mvar|i}}, and  & minus;{{mvar|i}}, complex numbers such as  < math > 3+i \\sqrt{2} < /math >  are considered constructible.) \n * Any expression formed from algebraic numbers using any combination of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of [[nth root|{{mvar|n}}th roots]] gives another algebraic number. \n * Polynomial roots that cannot be expressed in terms of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of {{mvar|n}}th roots (such as the roots of {{math|''x'' < sup > 5 < /sup >  \u2212 ''x'' + 1}}). [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem|That happens with many]] but not all polynomials of degree 5 or higher. \n * [[Gaussian integer]]s, complex numbers {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} for which both {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are integers and also quadratic integers. \n * Values of [[trigonometric functions]] of [[rational number|rational]] multiples of {{pi}} (except when undefined): that is, the [[trigonometric number]]s such as {{math|cos {{sfrac|{{math|\u03c0}}|7}}}}, {{math|cos {{sfrac|3{{math|\u03c0}}|7}}}}, {{math|cos {{sfrac|5{{math|\u03c0}}|7}}}} satisfies {{math|8''x'' < sup > 3 < /sup >  \u2212 4''x'' < sup > 2 < /sup >  \u2212 4''x'' + 1 {{=}} 0}}. The polynomial is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over the rationals and so the three cosines are ''conjugate'' algebraic numbers. Likewise, {{math|tan {{sfrac|3{{math|\u03c0}}|16}}}}, {{math|tan {{sfrac|7{{math|\u03c0}}|16}}}}, {{math|tan {{sfrac|11{{math|\u03c0}}|16}}}}, {{math|tan {{sfrac|15{{math|\u03c0}}|16}}}} satisfy the irreducible polynomial {{math|''x'' < sup > 4 < /sup >  \u2212 4''x'' < sup > 3 < /sup >  \u2212 6''x'' < sup > 2 < /sup >  + 4''x'' + 1 {{=}} 0}}, and so are conjugate [[algebraic integer]]s. \n * Some but not all irrational number are algebraic: \n ** The numbers  < math > \\sqrt{2} < /math >  and  < math > \\frac{ \\sqrt[3]{3} }{ 2 } < /math >  are algebraic since they are roots of polynomials {{math|''x'' < sup > 2 < /sup >  \u2212 2}} and {{math|8''x'' < sup > 3 < /sup >  \u2212 3}}, respectively. \n ** The [[golden ratio]] {{mvar|\u03c6}} is algebraic since it is a root of the polynomial {{math|''x'' < sup > 2 < /sup >  \u2212 ''x'' \u2212 1}}. \n ** The numbers {{pi}} and [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] are not algebraic numbers (see the [[Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem]]). < ref > Also, [[Liouville number|Liouville's theorem]] can be used to  \" produce as many examples of transcendental numbers as we please, \"  cf.

(This text: [[Template:Anchor comment]]) -- > \n [[File:Algebraicszoom.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers on the [[complex plane]] colored by degree (red = 1, green = 2, blue = 3, yellow = 4)]] \n *Given an algebraic number, there is a unique [[monic polynomial]] (with rational coefficients) of least [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] that has the number as a root. This polynomial is called its [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]]. If its minimal polynomial has degree {{mvar|n}}, then the algebraic number is said to be of '''degree {{mvar|n}}'''. For example, all [[rational number]]s have degree 1, and an algebraic number of degree 2 is a [[quadratic irrational]]. \n *The real algebraic numbers are [[dense set|dense]] [[densely ordered|in the reals]], [[linearly ordered]], and without first or last element (and therefore [[order-isomorphic]] to the set of rational numbers). \n *The set of algebraic numbers is countable (enumerable), < ref > Hardy and Wright 1972:160 / 2008:205 < /ref > < ref > Niven 1956, Theorem 7.5. < /ref >  and therefore its [[Lebesgue measure]] as a subset of the complex numbers is 0 (essentially, the algebraic numbers take up no space in the complex numbers). That is to say, [[Almost everywhere| \" almost all \" ]] real and complex numbers are transcendental. \n *All algebraic numbers are [[computable number|computable]] and therefore [[definable number|definable]] and [[arithmetical numbers|arithmetical]]. \n *For real numbers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, the complex number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} is algebraic if and only if both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are algebraic. < ref > Niven 1956, Corollary 7.3. < /ref > \n \n ==Field== \n [[File:Algebraic number in the complex plane.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers colored by degree (blue = 4, cyan = 3, red = 2, green = 1). The unit circle is black.]] \n The sum, difference, product and quotient (if the denominator is nonzero) of two algebraic numbers is again algebraic, as can be demonstrated by using the [[resultant]], and algebraic numbers thus form a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|{{overline|\u211a}}}} (sometimes denoted by  < math > \\mathbb A < /math > , but that usually denotes the [[adele ring]]). Every root of a polynomial equation whose coefficients are ''algebraic numbers'' is again algebraic. That can be rephrased by saying that the field of algebraic numbers is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. In fact, it is the smallest algebraically-closed field containing the rationals and so it is called the [[algebraic closure]] of the rationals. \n \n The set of real algebraic numbers itself forms a field. < ref > Niven (1956) p. & nbsp;92. < /ref > \n \n ==Related fields== \n \n ===Numbers defined by radicals=== \n All numbers that can be obtained from the integers using a [[finite set|finite]] number of complex [[addition]]s, [[subtraction]]s, [[multiplication]]s, [[division (mathematics)|division]]s, and taking {{mvar|n}}th roots where {{mvar|n}} is a positive integer ([[radical expression]]s), are algebraic. The converse, however, is not true: there are algebraic numbers that cannot be obtained in this manner. These numbers are roots of polynomials of degree & nbsp;5 or higher, a result of [[Galois theory]] (see [[Quintic equation]]s and the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]). For example, the equation: \n \n : < math > x^5-x-1=0 < /math > \n \n has a unique real root which is given by:{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} \n \n : < math > \\begin{align} \n x  & = {}_4F_{3} \\left(\\left.\\begin{matrix}-\\frac{1}{20},\\frac{3}{20},\\frac{7}{20},\\frac{11}{20}\\\\ \\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{3}{4}\\end{matrix}\\right|\\frac{3125}{256}\\right)+\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot {}_4F_{3} \\left(\\left.\\begin{matrix}\\frac{1}{5},\\frac{2}{5},\\frac{3}{5},\\frac{4}{5}\\\\ \\frac{1}{2},\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{5}{4}\\end{matrix}\\right|\\frac{3125}{256} \\right)- \\frac{5}{32} \\cdot {}_4F_{3} \\left( \\left.\\begin{matrix}\\frac{9}{20},\\frac{13}{20},\\frac{17}{20},\\frac{21}{20}\\\\ \\frac{3}{4},\\frac{5}{4},\\frac{3}{2} \\end{matrix} \\right|\\frac{3125}{256}\\right)+\\frac{5}{32} \\cdot{}_4F_{3} \\left(\\left.\\begin{matrix}\\frac{7}{10},\\frac{9}{10},\\frac{11}{10}, \\frac{13}{10}\\\\ \\frac{5}{4},\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{7}{4}\\end{matrix}\\right|\\frac{3125}{256}\\right) \\\\[8pt] \n & =1.167303978261418684\\ldots \n \\end{align} < /math > \n \n where \n \n : < math > {}_{p}F_{q} \\left(\\left.\\begin{matrix}a_1,\\ldots, a_p\\\\ b_1,\\ldots, b_q\\end{matrix}\\right|z\\right) < /math > \n \n is the [[generalized hypergeometric function]]. \n \n ===Closed-form number=== \n {{Main|Closed-form number}} \n Algebraic numbers are all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, starting from the rational numbers. One may generalize this to  \" [[closed-form number]]s \" , which may be defined in various ways. Most broadly, all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms are called  \" [[elementary number]]s \" , and these include the algebraic numbers, plus some transcendental numbers. Most narrowly, one may consider numbers ''explicitly'' defined in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms \u2013 this does not include all algebraic numbers, but does include some simple transcendental numbers such as {{mvar|e}} or [[Natural logarithm of 2|ln & nbsp;2]]. \n \n ==Algebraic integers== \n [[Image:Leadingcoeff.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers colored by leading coefficient (red signifies 1 for an algebraic integer)]] \n {{Main|Algebraic integer}} \n An ''algebraic integer'' is an algebraic number that is a root of  a polynomial with integer coefficients with leading coefficient 1 (a [[monic polynomial]]). Examples of algebraic integers are  < math > 5 + 13 \\sqrt{2}, < /math >   < math > 2 - 6i, < /math >  and  < math display=inline > \\frac{1}{2}(1+i\\sqrt{3}). < /math >  Therefore, the algebraic integers constitute a proper [[superset]] of the [[integer]]s, as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials {{math|''x'' \u2212 ''k''}} for all {{math|''k'' \u2208 \u2124.}} In this sense, algebraic integers are to algebraic numbers what [[integer]]s are to [[rational number]]s. \n \n The sum, difference and product of algebraic integers are again algebraic integers, which means that the algebraic integers form a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]. The name ''algebraic integer'' comes from the fact that the only rational numbers that are algebraic integers are the integers, and because the algebraic integers in any [[algebraic number field|number field]] are in many ways analogous to the integers. If {{math|''K''}} is a number field, its [[ring of integers]] is the subring of algebraic integers in {{math|''K''}}, and is frequently denoted as {{math|''O < sub > K < /sub > ''}}.
