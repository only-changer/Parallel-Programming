However, the area of what later became Amsterdam - along the prehistoric [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] river and its [[tributary]] Amstel - had been settled almost three millennia ago by local farmers. The IJ was mainly in peatland behind [[Beach ridge|beach ridges]], and could grow there into an important settlement center, especially in the late [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age]], the [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]] and the [[Roman Empire|Roman Age]].

This side arm took the name from the eponymous land: [[Amstel]]. Amestelle was inhabited by farmers, who lived more inland and more upstream, where the land was not as wet as at the banks of the downstream river mouth. These farmers were starting the reclamation around upstream [[Ouderkerk aan de Amstel]], and later at the other side of the river at [[Amstelveen]]. The [[Van Amstel family]], known in documents by this name since 1019, < ref name= \" :6 \"  / >  held the stewardship in this northwestern nook of the ecclesiastical district of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht|bishop of Utrecht]]. The family later served also under the [[count of Holland]]. \n \n A major turning point in the development of the Amstel river mouth is the [[All Saints' Flood (1170)|All Saint's Flood of 1170]]. In an extremely short period of time, the shallow river IJ turned into a wide estuary, which from then on offered the Amstel an open connection to the [[Zuiderzee]], [[IJssel]] and waterways further afield. This made the water flow of the Amstel more active, so excess water could be drained better. With drier banks, the downstream Amstel mouth became  attractive for permanent habitation. Moreover, the river had grown from an insignificant peat stream into a junction of international waterways. < ref > {{Cite journal |last=Gawronski |first=J |date=2017 |title=Ontstaan uit een storm; De vroegste geschiedenis van Amsterdam archeologisch en landschappelijk belicht |trans-title=Born from a storm; The earliest history of Amsterdam from a landscape and archaeological perspective. |url=https://www.theobakker.net/pdf/TX_Gawronski2017JbAmstelodamum_10.pdf |journal=Jaarboek van Het Genootschap Amstelodamum |language=Dutch |location=Amsterdam |publisher=University of Amsterdam |volume=109 |access-date=5 January 2021}}, pp. 75-77. < /ref >  A settlement was built here immediately after the landscape change of 1170, and right from the start of its foundation it focused on traffic, production and trade; not on farming, as opposed to how communities had lived further upstream for the past 200 years and northward for thousands of years. < ref > {{Cite journal |last=Gawronski |first=J |date=2017 |title=Ontstaan uit een storm; De vroegste geschiedenis van Amsterdam archeologisch en landschappelijk belicht |trans-title=Born from a storm; The earliest history of Amsterdam from afrom a landscape and archaeological perspective. |url=https://www.theobakker.net/pdf/TX_Gawronski2017JbAmstelodamum_10.pdf |journal=Jaarboek van Het Genootschap Amstelodamum |language=Dutch |location=Amsterdam |publisher=University of Amsterdam |volume=109 |access-date=5 January 2021}}, pp. 84-85. < /ref >  The construction of a dam at the mouth of the Amstel, eponymously named [[Dam Square|Dam]], is historically estimated to have occurred between 1264 and 1275.

After the independence of Suriname in 1975, a large wave of Surinamese settled in Amsterdam, mostly in the [[Bijlmermeer|Bijlmer]] area.

Around 1815, architects broke with the baroque style and started building in different neo-styles. < ref name= \" neostijl \" > {{Cite web |title=Neo-stijlen |url=http://www.bmz.amsterdam.nl/adam/nl/neostijl.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819204630/http://www.bmz.amsterdam.nl/adam/nl/neostijl.html |archive-date=19 August 2007 |access-date=19 May 2008 |language=nl}} < /ref >  Most Gothic style buildings date from that era and are therefore said to be built in a [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] style. At the end of the 19th century, the [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] or [[Art Nouveau]] style became popular and many new buildings were constructed in this architectural style. Since Amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period, new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style. The houses in the vicinity of the [[Museumplein|Museum Square]] in Amsterdam Oud-Zuid are an example of Jugendstil. The last style that was popular in Amsterdam before the [[Modern history|modern era]] was [[Art Deco]]. Amsterdam had its own version of the style, which was called the [[Amsterdam School|Amsterdamse School]]. Whole districts were built this style, such as the ''Rivierenbuurt''. < ref name= \" aschool \" > {{Cite web |title=Amsterdamse School |url=http://www.bmz.amsterdam.nl/adam/nl/aschool.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027144316/http://www.bmz.amsterdam.nl/adam/nl/aschool.html |archive-date=27 October 2007 |access-date=21 May 2008 |language=nl}} < /ref >  A notable feature of the fa\u00e7ades of buildings designed in Amsterdamse School is that they are highly decorated and ornate, with oddly shaped windows and doors. \n \n The old city centre is the focal point of all the architectural styles before the end of the 19th century. \n Jugendstil and Georgian are mostly found outside the city's centre in the neighbourhoods built in the early \n 20th century, although there are also some striking examples of these styles in the city centre. \n Most historic buildings in the city centre and nearby are houses, such as the famous merchants' houses lining the canals. \n \n ===Parks and recreational areas=== \n {{main|List of parks in Amsterdam|List of squares in Amsterdam}} \n [[File:Amsterdam map indicating parks - 01.png|thumb|{{unbulleted list \n | A: [[Vondelpark]] \n | B: [[Beatrixpark]] \n | C: [[Sarphatipark]] \n | D: [[Oosterpark (Amsterdam)|Oosterpark]] \n | E: [[Park Frankendael]] \n | F: [[Rembrandtpark]] \n | G: [[Westerpark (park)|Westerpark]] \n | H: [[Flevopark]] \n | I: [[Amsterdamse Bos]] \n | J: [[Amstelpark]] \n | K: [[Hortus Botanicus (Amsterdam)|Hortus Botanicus]] \n | L: [[Wertheimerpark]] \n | M: [[Martin Luther Kingpark]] \n | N: [[Sloterpark]] \n }} \n ]] \n \n Amsterdam has many parks, open spaces, and squares throughout the city.

The [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|boroughs]] are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city. In 2010, the number of [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|Amsterdam boroughs]] reached fifteen. Fourteen of those had their own district council (''deelraad''), elected by a popular vote. The fifteenth, [[Westpoort]], covers the harbour of Amsterdam and had very few residents. Therefore, it was governed by the central municipal council. \n \n Under the borough system, municipal decisions are made at borough level, except for those affairs pertaining to the whole city such as major infrastructure projects, which are the jurisdiction of the central municipal authorities. In 2010, the [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|borough]] system was restructured, in which many smaller boroughs merged into larger boroughs. In 2014, under a reform of the Dutch Municipalities Act, the [[Boroughs of Amsterdam|Amsterdam boroughs]] lost much of their autonomous status, as their district councils were abolished. \n \n The municipal council of Amsterdam voted to maintain the borough system by replacing the district councils with smaller, but still directly elected district committees (''bestuurscommissies''). Under a municipal ordinance, the new district committees were granted responsibilities through delegation of regulatory and executive powers by the central municipal council. \n [[File:Amsterdam Amstel.jpg|thumb|800px|center| < center > View of the [[Stopera]] (left), behind the [[Blauwbrug]] (blue bridge), where the Amsterdam city hall and opera house are located, and the [[Hermitage Amsterdam|Hermitage Museum]] (right) on the [[Amstel]] < /center > ]] \n \n ===Metropolitan area=== \n [[File:Police Headquarters, Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Police headquarters of Amsterdam]] \n \" Amsterdam \"  is usually understood to refer to the [[Municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] of Amsterdam.

The ceremony traditionally takes place at the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]] on [[Dam Square]], immediately after the former monarch has signed the act of abdication at the nearby [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam]]. Normally, however, the Parliament sits in [[The Hague]], the city which has historically been the seat of the [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch government]], the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch monarchy]], and the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|Dutch supreme court]]. Foreign embassies are also located in The Hague. \n \n ===Symbols=== \n {{Main|Coat of arms of Amsterdam|Flag of Amsterdam}} \n The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of several historical elements. First and centre are three [[Saltire|St Andrew's crosses]], aligned in a vertical band on the city's shield (although Amsterdam's [[patron saint]] was [[Saint Nicholas]]). These St Andrew's crosses can also be found on the city shields of neighbours [[Amstelveen]] and [[Ouder-Amstel]]. This part of the coat of arms is the basis of the [[flag of Amsterdam]], flown by the city government, but also as [[civil ensign]] for ships registered in Amsterdam. Second is the [[Imperial Crown of Austria]]. In 1489, out of gratitude for services and loans, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] awarded Amsterdam the right to adorn its coat of arms with the [[King of the Romans|king's]] crown. Then, in 1508, this was replaced with Maximilian's [[imperial crown]] when he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. In the early years of the 17th century, Maximilian's crown in Amsterdam's coat of arms was again replaced, this time with the crown of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolph II]], a crown that became the Imperial [[Austrian Crown Jewels|Crown of Austria]]. The lions date from the late 16th century, when city and province became part of the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]]. Last came the city's official motto: ''Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig'' ( \" Heroic, Determined, Merciful \" ), bestowed on the city in 1947 by [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], in recognition of the city's bravery during the Second World War. \n \n ==Transport== \n {{Main|Transport in Amsterdam}} \n \n ===Metro, tram and bus=== \n {{main|Amsterdam Metro|Trams in Amsterdam}} \n [[File:Amsterdam - Keizersgracht - 1316.jpg|thumb|A tram crossing the Keizersgracht]] \n [[File:NoordZuidLijn Metrostation Europaplein hnapel 004.jpg|thumb|The [[Amsterdam Metro]] is a mixed subway and above ground [[Rapid Transit|rapid transit system]] consisting of five lines.]] \n Currently, there are sixteen [[Trams in Amsterdam|tram routes]] and five [[Amsterdam Metro|metro routes]].

Hilversum is home to an extensive complex of audio and television studios belonging to the national broadcast production company NOS, as well as to the studios and offices of all the Dutch public broadcasting organisations and many commercial TV production companies. \n \n In 2012, the music video of Far East Movement, 'Live My Life', was filmed in various parts of Amsterdam. \n \n Also, several movies were filmed in Amsterdam, such as [[James Bond]]'s [[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]], [[Ocean's Twelve]], [[Girl with a Pearl Earring (film)|Girl with a Pearl Earring]] and [[The Hitman's Bodyguard]]. Amsterdam is also featured in [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s book ''[[The Fault in Our Stars]]'', which has been made into [[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|a film]] as well that partly takes place in Amsterdam. \n \n ==Housing== \n The housing market is heavily regulated. The increased influx of migrants, especially since the Syrian Civil War (2011\u2013present), has been burdensome, economically and culturally, but the government deals with citizen and migrant cases for housing equally. According to the Netherlands' Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,  \" 60% of housing stock is controlled by housing corporations.
