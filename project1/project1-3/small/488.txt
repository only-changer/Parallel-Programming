In 734 BC the Ammonite king [[Sanipu]] was a vassal of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], and Sanipu's successor [[Pudu-ilu]] held the same position under [[Sennacherib]] and [[Esarhaddon]]. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" > {{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ammonites|volume=1|pages=863-864}} < /ref >  An Assyrian tribute-list exists from this period, showing that Ammon paid one-fifth as much tribute as Judah did. < ref > See Schrader, ''K.A.T.'' pp. 141 et seq.; Delitzsch, ''Paradies,'' p. 294; Winckler, ''Geschichte Israels,'' p. 215. < /ref > \n \n Somewhat later, the Ammonite king [[Amminadab I of Ammon|Amminadab I]] was among the tributaries who suffered in the course of the great [[Arabia]]n campaign of [[Assurbanipal]]. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  Other kings attested to in contemporary sources are [[Barachel (Ammon)|Barachel]] (attested to in several contemporary [[seal (device)|seals]]) and [[Hissalel]], the latter of whom reigned about 620 BCE. Hissalel is mentioned in an inscription on a [[Tel Siran inscription|bottle found at Tel Siran]], Jordan along with his son, King [[Amminadab II of Ammon|Amminadab II]], who reigned around 600 BCE. \n \n Archaeology and history indicate that Ammon flourished during the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] period. This contradicts the view, dominant for decades, that Transjordan was either destroyed by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], or suffered a rapid decline following Judah's destruction by that king. Newer evidence suggests that Ammon enjoyed continuity from the Neo-Babylonian to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] period. < ref name= \" Barstad2012 \" > {{cite book|author=Barstad, Hans M|editor1=John J.

After the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], the daughters of Lot wanted to have a child and carried out a plot to intoxicate him and have intercourse, resulting in Ammon and his half brother, [[Moab]], being conceived and born. This narrative has traditionally been considered literal fact; but is now generally interpreted as recording a gross popular irony by which the Israelites expressed their loathing of the morality of the Moabites and Ammonites.  It has been doubted, however, whether the Israelites would have directed such irony to Lot himself. < ref name=Fenlon > [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01431b.htm Fenlon, John Francis.  \" Ammonites. \"  The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 1.

It was accounted a land of giants; and that giants formerly dwelt in it, whom the Ammonites called Zamzummim. < ref name=Fenlon/ > \n \n Shortly before the Israelite [[the Exodus|Exodus]], the [[Amorite]]s west of Jordan, under King [[Sihon]], invaded and occupied [[Transjordan (region)|a large portion of the territory of Moab and Ammon]].

During the Exodus, the Israelites were prohibited by the Ammonites from passing through their lands. The Ammonites soon allied themselves with [[Eglon (king)|Eglon]] of Moab in attacking Israel. \n \n The Ammonites maintained their claim to part of [[Transjordan (Bible)|Transjordan]], after it was occupied by the Israelites who obtained it from [[Sihon]]. During the days of [[Jephthah]], the Ammonites occupied the lands east of the River Jordan and started to invade Israelite lands west of the river. Jephthah became the leader in resisting these incursions. \n \n The constant harassment of the Israelite communities east of the Jordan by the Ammonites was the impetus behind the unification of the tribes under [[Saul]]. King [[Nahash of Ammon]] ({{circa|1010}}{{snd}}990 BC) lay siege to [[Jabesh-Gilead]]. This eventually led to an alliance with Saul. Under his command, the Israelites relieved the siege and defeated the Ammonite king, eventually resulting in the formation of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israelite kingdom]]. \n \n During the reign of [[King David]], the Ammonites humiliated David's messengers, and hired the Aramean armies to attack Israel. This eventually ended in a war and a year-long siege of [[Rabbah]], the capital of Ammon. The war ended with all the Ammonite cities being conquered and plundered, and the inhabitants being killed or put to forced labor at David's command. < ref > {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|12:31|KJV}} < /ref > < ref > {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|20:3|KJV}} < /ref > \n \n According to both Kings 14:21-31 and Chronicles 12:13, < ref > {{bibleverse|1|Kings|14:21\u201331|NIV}} and {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|12:13|NIV}} < /ref >  [[Naamah (wife of Solomon)|Naamah]] was an Ammonite.

The story reflects actual conditions in pre-Talmudic times, conditions that led to the fixed rule stated in the Mishnah: < ref > Yeb. viii. 3 < /ref >   \" Ammonite and Moabite men are excluded from the Jewish community for all time; their women are admissible. \" \n \n The fact that [[Rehoboam]], the son of King [[Solomon]], was born of an Ammonite woman < ref > I Kings, xiv. 21-31 < /ref >  also made it difficult to maintain the Messianic claims of the [[Davidic line|house of David]]; but it was adduced as an illustration of divine Providence which selected the  \" two doves, \"  Ruth, the Moabite, and [[Naamah (wife of Solomon)|Naamah]], the Ammonitess, for honorable distinction. < ref > B. \u1e32. 38b < /ref > < ref > [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1414-ammon-ammonites Jewish encyclopedia Ammonites] < /ref >  Ruth's kindness as noted in the Book of Ruth by Boaz is seen in the Jewish Tradition as in rare contradistinction to the peoples of Moab (where Ruth comes from) and Amon in general, who were noted by the Torah for their distinct ''lack'' of kindness. Deut. 23:5:  \" Because they [the peoples of Amon and Moab] did not greet you with bread and water on the way when you left Egypt, and because he [the people of Moab] hired Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor in Aram Naharaim against you, to curse you. \"  Rashi notes regarding Israel's travels on the way:  \" when you were in [a state of] extreme exhaustion. \" \n \n Baalis, king of the Ammonites, envious of the Jewish colony's prosperity, or jealous of the might of the Babylonian king, instigated [[Ishmael son of Nethaniah|Ishmael, son of Nathaniel]],  \" of the royal seed, \"  to make an end of the Judean rule in Palestine, Ishmael, being an unscrupulous character, permitted himself to become the tool of the Ammonite king in order to realize his own ambition to become the ruler of the deserted land. Information of this conspiracy reached [[Gedaliah]] through Johanan, son of Kareah, and Johanan undertook to slay Ishmael before he had had time to carry out his evil design; but the governor disbelieved the report, and forbade Johanan to lay hands upon the conspirator. Ishmael and his ten companions were royally entertained at Gedaliah's table. In the midst of the festivities Ishmael slew the unsuspecting Gedaliah, the Chaldean garrison stationed in Mizpah, and all the Jews that were with him, casting their bodies into the pit of Asa (Josephus,  \" Ant. \"  x. 9, \u00a7 4). The Rabbis condemn the overconfidence of Gedaliah, holding him responsible for the death of his followers (Niddah 61a; comp. Jer. xli. 9). Ishmael captured many of the inhabitants of Mizpah, as well as  \" the daughters of the king \"  entrusted to Gedaliah's care by the Babylonian general, and fled to Ammon. Johanan and his followers, however, on receiving the sad tidings, immediately pursued the murderers, overtaking them at the lake of Gibeon. The captives were rescued, but Ishmael and eight of his men escaped to the land of Ammon. The plan of Baalis thus succeeded, for the Jewish refugees, fearing lest the Babylonian king should hold them responsible for the murder, never returned to their native land. In spite of the exhortations of Jeremiah they fled to Egypt, joined by the remnant of the Jews that had survived, together with Jeremiah and Baruch (Jer. xliii. 6). The rule of Gedaliah lasted, according to tradition, only two months, although Gr\u00e4tz argues that it continued more than four years. < ref > [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6548-gedallah Jewish Encyclopedia Gedallah] < /ref > \n \n ==Language== \n {{Main|Ammonite language}} \n The few Ammonite names that have been preserved also include Nahash and [[Hanun]], both from the Bible. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  The Ammonites' language is believed to be in the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite family]], closely related to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Moabite language|Moabite]].
