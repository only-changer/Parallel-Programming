Abraham purchases a tomb (the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]]) at [[Hebron]] to be Sarah's grave, thus establishing his right to the land; and, in the second generation, his heir Isaac is married to a woman from his own kin, thus ruling the [[Canaan]]ites out of any inheritance.

This became a problem for the herdsmen, who were assigned to each family's cattle. The conflicts between herdsmen had become so troublesome that Abram suggested that Lot choose a separate area, either on the left hand or on the right hand, that there be no conflict amongst brethren. Lot decided to go eastward to the plain of [[Jordan River|Jordan]], where the land was well watered everywhere as far as Zoar, and he dwelled in the cities of the plain toward [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. Abram went south to [[Hebron]] and settled in the plain of [[Mamre]], where he built another altar to worship [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]]. \n \n ===Chedorlaomer=== \n {{Main|Battle of Siddim}} \n [[File:Meeting of abraham and melchizadek.jpg|thumb|''Meeting of Abraham and Melchizedek'', canvas by [[Dieric Bouts|Dieric Bouts the Elder]], c. 1464\u20131467]] \n \n During the rebellion of the Jordan River cities, [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], against [[Elam]], < ref > {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:1\u20139|niv}} < /ref >  Abram's nephew, Lot, was taken prisoner along with his entire household by the invading Elamite forces.

Once Abram received this news, he immediately assembled 318 trained servants. Abram's force headed north in pursuit of the Elamite army, who were already worn down from the [[Battle of the Vale of Siddim|Battle of Siddim]]. When they caught up with them at [[Dan (Bible)|Dan]], Abram devised a battle plan by splitting his group into more than one unit, and launched a night raid. Not only were they able to free the captives, Abram's unit chased and slaughtered the Elamite King [[Chedorlaomer]] at Hobah, just north of [[Damascus]]. They freed Lot, as well as his household and possessions, and recovered all of the goods from Sodom that had been taken. < ref > {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|14:13\u201316|niv}} < /ref > \n \n Upon Abram's return, Sodom's king came out to meet with him in the [[King's dale|Valley of Shaveh]], the  \" king's dale \" . Also, [[Melchizedek]] king of Salem ([[Jerusalem]]), a priest of [[Elyon|El Elyon]], brought out bread and wine and blessed Abram and God. Abram then gave Melchizedek a [[tithe|tenth]] of everything. The king of Sodom then offered to let Abram keep all the possessions if he would merely return his people.

Abram and God made a covenant ceremony, and God told of the future bondage of Israel in Egypt. God described to Abram the land that his offspring would claim: the land of the [[Kenites]], [[Kenizzite]]s, [[Kadmonites]], [[Biblical Hittites|Hittites]], [[Perizzites]], Rephaims, [[Amorites]], [[Canaanites]], [[Girgashites]], and [[Jebusite]]s. < ref > {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|15:1\u201321|niv}} < /ref > \n \n ===Hagar=== \n {{see also|Hagar|Hagar in Islam}} \n [[File:Foster Bible Pictures 0032-1.jpg|thumb|right|''Abraham, [[Sarah]] and [[Hagar]]'', imagined here in a Bible illustration from 1897.]] \n \n Abram and Sarai tried to make sense of how he would become a progenitor of nations, because after 10 years of living in Canaan, no child had been born. Sarai then offered her Egyptian handmaiden, [[Hagar]], to Abram with the intention that she would bear him a son. \n \n After Hagar found she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress, Sarai. Sarai responded by mistreating Hagar, and Hagar fled into the wilderness. An angel spoke with Hagar at the fountain on the way to [[Shur (Bible)|Shur]]. He instructed her to return to Abram's camp and that her son would be  \" a wild ass of a man; his hand shall be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren. \"  She was told to call her son [[Ishmael]]. Hagar then called God who spoke to her  \" [[El Roi|El-roi]] \" , ( \" Thou God seest me: \"  KJV). From that day onward, the well was called Beer-lahai-roi, ( \" The well of him that liveth and seeth me. \"  KJV margin). She then did as she was instructed by returning to her mistress in order to have her child.

He looked up and saw three men in the presence of God. Then he ran and bowed to the ground to welcome them. Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, to which they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarah's tent to order [[ash cake]]s made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf. When all was prepared, he set curds, milk and the calf before them, waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate. < ref > {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|18:1\u20138|niv}} < /ref > \n \n One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at bearing a child at her age, as nothing is too hard for God. Frightened, Sarah denied laughing. \n \n ===Abraham's plea=== \n {{main|Sodom and Gomorrah|Lot (biblical person)}} \n [[File:Tissot Abraham Sees Sodom in Flames.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Abraham Sees Sodom in Flames'', watercolor by [[James Tissot]], {{circa|1896\u20131902}}]] \n \n After eating, Abraham and the three visitors got up. They walked over to the peak that overlooked the 'cities of the plain' to discuss the fate of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] for their detestable sins that were so great, it moved God to action. Because Abraham's nephew was living in Sodom, God revealed plans to confirm and judge these cities. At this point, the two other visitors left for Sodom. Then Abraham turned to God and pleaded decrementally with Him (from fifty persons to less) that  \" if there were at least ten righteous men found in the city, would not God spare the city? \"  For the sake of ten righteous people, God declared that he would not destroy the city. < ref > {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|18:17\u201333|niv}} < /ref > \n \n When the two visitors arrived in Sodom to conduct their report, they planned on staying in the city square. However, Abraham's nephew, Lot, met with them and strongly insisted that these two  \" men \"  stay at his house for the night. A rally of men stood outside of Lot's home and demanded that Lot bring out his guests so that they may  \" know \"  ({{Abbr|v.|verse}} 5) them. However, Lot objected and offered his virgin daughters who had not  \" known \"  (v. 8) man to the rally of men instead. They rejected that notion and sought to break down Lot's door to get to his male guests, < ref > {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|19:1\u20139|niv}} < /ref >  thus confirming the wickedness of the city and portending their imminent destruction. < ref > {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|19:12\u201313|niv}} < /ref > \n \n Early the next morning, Abraham went to the place where he stood before God. He  \" looked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah \"  and saw what became of the cities of the plain, where not even  \" ten righteous \"  (v. 18:32) had been found, as  \" the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace. \" < ref > {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|19:27\u201329|niv}} < /ref > \n \n ===Abimelech=== \n [[File:Tissot The Caravan of Abraham.jpg|thumb|''The Caravan of Abraham'', watercolor by [[James Tissot]], before 1903 ([[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]], New York)]] \n \n {{see also|Endogamy|Wife\u2013sister narratives in the Book of Genesis}} \n Abraham settled between [[Kadesh (South of Israel)|Kadesh]] and [[Shur (Bible)|Shur]] in what the Bible anachronistically calls  \" the land of the [[Philistine]]s \" . While he was living in [[Gerar]], Abraham openly claimed that Sarah was his sister. Upon discovering this news, King [[Abimelech]] had her brought to him. God then came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a man's wife. Abimelech had not laid hands on her, so he inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continued to exist. However, should he not return the wife of Abraham back to him, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him. < ref > {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|20:1\u20137|niv}} < /ref > \n \n Early next morning, Abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached Abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom. Abraham stated that he thought there was no fear of God in that place, and that they might kill him for his wife. Then Abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all:  \" And yet indeed ''she is'' my sister; she ''is'' the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. \" < ref > {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|20:12||Genesis 20:12|niv}} < /ref >  Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, and gave him gifts of sheep, oxen, and servants; and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelech's lands. Further, Abimelech gave Abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve as Sarah's vindication before all. Abraham then prayed for Abimelech and his household, since God had stricken the women with infertility because of the taking of Sarah. < ref > {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|20:8\u201318|niv}} < /ref > \n \n After living for some time in the land of the Philistines, Abimelech and [[Phicol]], the chief of his troops, approached Abraham because of a dispute that resulted in a violent confrontation at a well. Abraham then reproached Abimelech due to his Philistine servant's aggressive attacks and the seizing of [[Abraham's well]]. Abimelech claimed ignorance of the incident. Then Abraham offered a pact by providing sheep and oxen to Abimelech. Further, to attest that Abraham was the one who dug the well, he also gave Abimelech seven ewes for proof. Because of this sworn oath, they called the place of this well: [[Beersheba]]. After Abimelech and Phicol headed back to [[Philistia]], Abraham planted a    [[List of plants in the Bible|tamarisk]] grove in Beersheba and called upon  \" the name of the {{LORD}}, the everlasting God. \" < ref > {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|21:22\u201334||Genesis 21:22\u201334|niv}} < /ref > \n \n ===Isaac=== \n As had been prophesied in Mamre the previous year, < ref > {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|17:21|niv}} < /ref >  Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, on the first anniversary of the covenant of circumcision.

When she found Ishmael teasing Isaac, Sarah told Abraham to send both Ishmael and Hagar away. She declared that Ishmael would not share in Isaac's inheritance. Abraham was greatly distressed by his wife's words and sought the advice of his God. God told Abraham not to be distressed but to do as his wife commanded. God reassured Abraham that  \" in Isaac shall seed be called to thee. \" < ref > {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|21:12|niv}} < /ref >  He also said that Ishmael would make a nation,  \" because he is thy seed \" . < ref > {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|21:9\u201313|niv}} < /ref > \n \n Early the next morning, Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together. He gave her bread and water and sent them away. The two wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba until her bottle of water was completely consumed. In a moment of despair, she burst into tears. After God heard the boy's voice, an [[angel of the Lord]] confirmed to Hagar that he would become a great nation, and will be  \" living on his sword \" . A well of water then appeared so that it saved their lives. As the boy grew, he became a skilled [[Archery|archer]] living in the wilderness of [[Desert of Paran|Paran]].

The patriarch traveled three days until he came to the mount that God told him of. He then commanded the servants to remain while he and Isaac proceeded alone into the mount. Isaac carried the wood upon which he would be sacrificed. Along the way, Isaac asked his father where the animal for the burnt offering was, to which Abraham replied  \" God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering \" .

Albright]] and biblical scholars such as [[Albrecht Alt]] believed that the patriarchs and matriarchs were either real individuals or believable composites of people who lived in the  \" [[patriarchal age]] \" , the 2nd millennium BCE. But, in the 1970s, new arguments concerning Israel's past and the biblical texts challenged these views; these arguments can be found in [[Thomas L. Thompson]]'s ''[[The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives]]'' (1974), and [[John Van Seters]]' ''[[Abraham in History and Tradition]]'' (1975). Thompson, a literary scholar, based his argument on archaeology and ancient texts. His thesis centered on the lack of compelling evidence that the patriarchs lived in the 2nd millennium BCE, and noted how certain biblical texts reflected first millennium conditions and concerns. Van Seters examined the patriarchal stories and argued that their names, social milieu, and messages strongly suggested that they were [[Iron Age]] creations.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=18\u201319}} By the beginning of the 21st century, archaeologists had given up hope of recovering any context that would make Abraham, Isaac or Jacob credible historical figures.{{sfn|Dever|2002|p=98 and fn.2}} \n \n ==={{anchor|Renaming}} Origins of the narrative=== \n [[File:Abraham & #039;s Gate.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham's Gate|Abraham & #039;s Gate]]]] \n Abraham's story, like those of the other patriarchs, most likely had a substantial oral prehistory,{{sfn|Pitard|2001|p=27}} and his name is apparently very ancient, as the tradition found in Genesis no longer understands its original meaning (probably  \" Father is exalted \"  \u2013 the meaning offered in Genesis 17:5,  \" Father of a multitude \" , is a [[false etymology|popular etymology]]).{{sfn|Thompson|2002|pp=23\u201324}} At some stage the [[oral tradition]]s became part of the written tradition of the [[Pentateuch]]; a majority of scholars believe this stage belongs to the Persian period, roughly 520\u2013320 BCE.{{sfn|Ska|2009|p=260}} The mechanisms by which this came about remain unknown,{{sfn|Enns|2012|p=26}} but there are currently two important hypotheses.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=217, 227\u201328}} The first, called Persian Imperial authorisation, is that the post-Exilic community devised the Torah as a legal basis on which to function within the Persian Imperial system; the second is that the Pentateuch was written to provide the criteria for determining who would belong to the post-Exilic Jewish community and to establish the power structures and relative positions of its various groups, notably the priesthood and the lay  \" elders \" .{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=217, 227\u201328}} \n \n Nevertheless, the completion of the Torah and its elevation to the centre of post-Exilic Judaism was as much or more about combining older texts as writing new ones \u2013 the final Pentateuch was based on existing traditions.{{sfn|Carr|Conway|2010|p=193}} In [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], < ref > {{bibleverse-nb||Ezek|33:24|niv}} < /ref >  written during the Exile (i.e., in the first half of the 6th century BCE), [[Ezekiel]], an exile in Babylon, tells how those who remained in Judah are claiming ownership of the land based on inheritance from Abraham; but the prophet tells them they have no claim because they do not observe Torah.{{sfn|Ska|2009|p=43}} [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] < ref > {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|63:16|niv}} < /ref >  similarly testifies of tension between the people of Judah and the returning post-Exilic Jews (the  \" [[Golah|g\u00f4l\u00e2]] \" ), stating that God is the father of Israel and that Israel's history begins with the Exodus and not with Abraham.{{sfn|Ska|2009|p=44}} The conclusion to be inferred from this and similar evidence (e.g., [[Ezra\u2013Nehemiah]]), is that the figure of Abraham must have been preeminent among the great landowners of Judah at the time of the Exile and after, serving to support their claims to the land in opposition to those of the returning exiles.{{sfn|Ska|2009|p=44}} \n \n == Religious traditions == \n {{Infobox saint \n |name = Abraham \n |feast_day = 9 October \u2013 Roman Catholicism and Lutheranism < ref name= \" LCMS \" > {{cite web |title=Commemorations |url=https://www.lcms.org/worship/church-year/commemorations |publisher=[[Lutheran Church\u2014Missouri Synod]] |access-date=31 October 2020 |language=en}} < /ref > \n |venerated_in = {{hlist  < !--chronological:-- > |[[Judaism]] |[[Christianity]] |[[Islam]] |[[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith]]}} \n |image = Aert de Gelder 009.jpg \n |imagesize = 240px \n |caption = ''Abraham and the Angels'', by [[Aert de Gelder]], {{circa|1680\u201385}} ([[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]], Rotterdam) \n |titles = First Patriarch \n }} \n \n ===Overview=== \n Abraham is given a high position of respect in three major world faiths, [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].
