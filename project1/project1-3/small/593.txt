Ultimately, however, the rebellion is betrayed, and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before, under the dictatorship of a pig named [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]]. \n \n According to Orwell, the [[fable]] reflects events leading up to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and then on into the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927\u201353)|Stalinist era]] of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Gcse English Literature}}{{sfn|Meija|2002}}  Orwell, a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]],{{sfn|Orwell |2014 |p=23}} was a critic of [[Joseph Stalin]] and hostile to Moscow-directed [[Stalinism]], an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the [[May Days]] conflicts between the [[POUM]] and Stalinist forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Bowker |2013|p=235}}{{efn| Orwell, writing in his review of [[Franz Borkenau]]'s ''[[The Spanish Cockpit]]'' in ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'', 31 July 1937, and  \" Spilling the Spanish Beans \" , ''New English Weekly'', 29 July 1937}} The Soviet Union had become a totalitarian autocracy built upon a [[cult of personality]] while engaging in the practice of mass incarcerations and secret summary trials and executions. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described ''Animal Farm'' as a [[satire|satirical]] tale against Stalin ( \" ''{{lang|fr|un conte satirique contre Staline}}'' \" ),{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} and in his essay  \" [[Why I Write]] \"  (1946), wrote that ''Animal Farm'' was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing,  \" to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole \" .{{sfn|Orwell|2014|p=10}} \n \n The original title was ''Animal Farm: A Fairy Story,'' but U.S. publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946, and only one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime kept it. Other titular variations include subtitles like  \" A Satire \"  and  \" A Contemporary Satire \" .{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} Orwell suggested the title ''{{lang|fr|Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes animales}}'' for the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, the [[Latin]] word for  \" bear \" , a [[Russian bear|symbol of Russia]]. It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union, ''{{lang|fr|Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes sovi\u00e9tiques}}''.{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} \n \n Orwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the United Kingdom was in its [[Allies of World War II|wartime alliance]] with the Soviet Union against [[Nazi Germany]], and the British intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem, a phenomenon Orwell hated.{{efn|[[Bradbury, Malcolm]], Introduction |p=vi, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition, 1989}} The manuscript was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers,{{sfn|''Animal Farm'': Sixty}} including one of Orwell's own, [[Victor Gollancz]], which delayed its publication. It became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Dickstein |2007 |p= 134}} \n \n ''Time'' magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005|p=}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]],{{Sfn|Modern Library|1998}} and number 46 on the [[BBC]]'s [[The Big Read]] poll. < ref > [https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml  \" BBC & nbsp;\u2013 The Big Read \" ].

One night, the exalted boar, [[Old Major]], holds a conference, at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called  \" [[Beasts of England]] \" . When Old Major dies, two young pigs, [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] and [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], assume command and stage a revolt, driving Mr. Jones off the farm and renaming the property  \" Animal Farm \" . They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is,  \" All animals are equal \" . The decree is painted in large letters on one side of the barn. Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of [[#Animalism|Animalism]]. To commemorate the start of Animal Farm, Snowball raises a green flag with a white hoof and horn. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Jones and his associates to retake the farm (later dubbed the  \" Battle of the Cowshed \" ), Snowball announces his plans to modernise the farm by building a [[windmill]]. Napoleon disputes this idea, and matters come to head, which culminate in Napoleon's dogs chasing Snowball away and Napoleon declaring himself supreme commander. \n \n Napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm. Through a young porker named [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]], Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea, claiming that Snowball was only trying to win animals to his side. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer persuade the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project and begin to [[purge]] the farm of animals Napoleon accuses of consorting with his old rival. When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who was nowhere to be found during the battle) gradually smears Snowball to the point of saying he is a collaborator of Mr. Jones, even dismissing the fact that Snowball was given an award of courage while falsely representing himself as the main hero of the battle.  \" Beasts of England \"  is replaced with  \" Animal Farm \" , while an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man ( \" Comrade Napoleon \" ), is composed and sung. Napoleon then conducts a second purge, during which many animals who are alleged to be helping Snowball in plots are executed by Napoleon's dogs, which troubles the rest of the animals. Despite their hardships, the animals are easily placated by Napoleon's retort that they are better off than they were under Mr. Jones, as well as by the sheep's continual bleating of \u201cfour legs good, two legs bad\u201d. \n \n Mr. Frederick, a neighbouring farmer, attacks the farm, using [[Explosive material|blasting powder]] to blow up the restored windmill. Although the animals win the battle, they do so [[Pyrrhic victory|at great cost]], as many, including [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer the workhorse]], are wounded. Although he recovers from this, Boxer eventually collapses while working on the windmill (being almost 12 years old at that point). He is taken away in a [[knacker]]'s van, and a donkey called Benjamin alerts the animals of this, but Squealer quickly waves off their alarm by persuading the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital and that the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted. Squealer subsequently reports Boxer's death and honours him with a festival the following day. (However, Napoleon had in fact engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy [[whisky]] for themselves.) \n \n {{anchor|moreEqual}} \n Years pass, the windmill is rebuilt, and another windmill is constructed, which makes the farm a good amount of income. However, the ideals that Snowball discussed, including stalls with electric lighting, heating, and running water, are forgotten, with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives. Snowball has been forgotten, alongside Boxer, with  \" the exception of the few who knew him \" . Many of the animals who participated in the rebellion are dead or old. Mr. Jones is also dead, saying he  \" died in an inebriates' home in another part of the country \" . The pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, drink alcohol, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are abridged to just one phrase: '' \" All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others. \" '' The maxim '' \" Four legs good, two legs bad \" '' is similarly changed to '' \" Four legs good, two legs better. \" '' Other changes include the Hoof and Horn flag being replaced with a plain green banner and Old Major's skull, which was previously put on display, being reburied. \n \n Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name  \" The Manor Farm \" . The men and pigs start playing cards, flattering and praising each other while cheating at the game. Both Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington, one of the farmers, play the [[Ace of spades|Ace of Spades]] at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first. When the animals outside look at the pigs and men, they can no longer distinguish between the two. \n \n ==Characters== \n \n ===Pigs=== \n * [[Old Major]] \u2013 An aged prize [[Middle White|Middle White boar]] provides the inspiration that fuels the rebellion. He is also called Willingdon Beauty when [[Show (animal)|showing]]. He is an allegorical combination of [[Karl Marx]], one of the creators of communism, and [[Vladimir Lenin]], the communist leader of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the early Soviet nation, in that he draws up the principles of the revolution. His skull being put on revered public display recalls Lenin, whose [[Lenin's Mausoleum|embalmed body was put on display]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}} By the end of the book, the skull is reburied. \n * [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]] \u2013  \" A large, rather fierce-looking [[Berkshire pig|Berkshire]] boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way \" .{{sfn|Orwell|1979|loc=chapter II|p=15}} An allegory of [[Joseph Stalin]],{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}}  Napoleon is the leader of Animal Farm.  \n * [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] \u2013 Napoleon's rival and original head of the farm after Jones' overthrow. His life parallels that of [[Leon Trotsky]],{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}}  but may also combine elements from Lenin.{{sfn|Hitchens|2008|pp=186ff}}{{efn|According to [[Christopher Hitchens]],  \" the persons of Lenin and Trotsky are combined into one [i.e., Snowball], or, it might even be [...] to say, there is no Lenin at all. \" {{sfn|Hitchens|2008|pp=186ff}}}} \n * [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]] \u2013 A small, white, fat porker who serves as Napoleon's second-in-command and minister of propaganda, holding a position similar to that of [[Vyacheslav Molotov]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pp=5ff}} \n * Minimus \u2013 A poetic pig who writes the second and third national anthems of Animal Farm after the singing of  \" Beasts of England \"  is banned. Rodden compares him to the poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|p=11}} \n * The piglets \u2013 Hinted to be the children of Napoleon and are the first generation of animals subjugated to his idea of animal inequality. \n * The young pigs \u2013 Four pigs who complain about Napoleon's takeover of the farm but are quickly silenced and later executed, the first animals killed in Napoleon's farm purge. Probably based on the [[Great Purge]] of [[Grigori Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]], and [[Alexei Rykov]]. \n * Pinkeye \u2013 A minor pig who is mentioned only once; he is the taste tester that samples Napoleon's food to make sure it is not poisoned, in response to rumours about an assassination attempt on Napoleon. \n \n ===Humans=== \n * [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]] \u2013 A heavy drinker who is the original owner of Manor Farm, a farm in disrepair with farmhands who often loaf on the job. He is an allegory of Russian [[Tsar Nicholas II]],{{sfn|Fall of Mister}} who abdicated following the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 and was murdered, along with the rest of his family, by the [[Bolsheviks]] on 17 July 1918. The animals revolt after Jones drinks so much he does not care for them. \n * Mr. Frederick \u2013 The tough owner of Pinchfield Farm, a small but well-kept neighbouring farm, who briefly enters into an alliance with Napoleon.{{sfn|Sparknotes  \"  Literature}}{{sfn|Scheming Frederick how}}{{sfn|Meyers|1975 |p=141}}{{sfn|Bloom|2009}} Animal Farm shares land boundaries with Pinchfield on one side and Foxwood on another, making Animal Farm a  \" buffer zone \"  between the two bickering farmers. The animals of Animal Farm are terrified of Frederick, as rumours abound of him abusing his animals and entertaining himself with [[cockfighting]] (a likely allegory for the human rights abuses of [[Adolf Hitler]]). Napoleon enters into an alliance with Frederick in order to sell surplus timber that Pilkington also sought, but is enraged to learn Frederick paid him in counterfeit money. Shortly after the swindling, Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm, killing many animals and destroying the windmill. The brief alliance and subsequent invasion may allude to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] and [[Operation Barbarossa]].{{sfn|Meyers|1975|p=141}}{{sfn| Firchow |2008 |p=102}}{{sfn| Davison |1996|p= 161}} \n * Mr. Pilkington \u2013 The easy-going but crafty and well-to-do owner of Foxwood Farm, a large neighbouring farm overgrown with weeds. Pilkington is wealthier than Frederick and owns more land, but his farm is in need of care as opposed to Frederick's smaller but more efficiently run farm. Although on bad terms with Frederick, Pilkington is also concerned about the animal revolution that deposed Jones and worried that this could also happen to him. \n * Mr. Whymper \u2013 A man hired by Napoleon to act as the liaison between Animal Farm and human society. At first, he is used to acquire necessities that cannot be produced on the farm, such as dog biscuits and [[paraffin wax]], but later he procures luxuries like alcohol for the pigs. \n \n ===Equines=== \n * [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] \u2013 A loyal, kind, dedicated, extremely strong, hard-working, and respectable cart-horse, although quite naive and gullible. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >  Boxer does a large share of the physical labour on the farm. He is shown to hold the belief that  \" Napoleon is always right. \"  At one point, he had challenged Squealer's statement that Snowball was always against the welfare of the farm, earning him an attack from Napoleon's dogs. But Boxer's immense strength repels the attack, worrying the pigs that their authority can be challenged. Boxer has been compared to [[Alexey Stakhanov]], a diligent and enthusiastic role model of the [[Stakhanovite movement]].{{sfn|Rodden|1999|p=12}} He has been described as  \" faithful and strong \" ;{{sfn|Sutherland|2005|pp=17\u201319}} he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder.{{sfn|Roper|1977|pp=11\u201363}} When Boxer is injured, Napoleon sells him to a local [[knacker]] to buy himself whisky, and Squealer gives a moving account, falsifying Boxer's death. \n * Mollie \u2013 A self-centred, self-indulgent, and vain young white mare who quickly leaves for another farm after the revolution, in a manner similar to those who left Russia after the fall of the Tsar. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/animalfarm/characters/|title=Animal Farm Characters|last=SparkNotes Editors.|date=2007|website=SparkNotes|access-date=December 7, 2019}} < /ref >  She is only once mentioned again. \n * Clover \u2013 A gentle, caring mare, who shows concern especially for Boxer, who often pushes himself too hard. Clover can read all the letters of the alphabet, but cannot  \" put words together \" . She seems to catch on to the sly tricks and schemes set up by Napoleon and Squealer. \n * [[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]] \u2013 A donkey, one of the oldest, wisest animals on the farm, and one of the few who can read properly. He is sceptical, temperamental and cynical: his most frequent remark is,  \" Life will go on as it has always gone on \u2013 that is, badly. \"   The academic Morris Dickstein has suggested there is  \" a touch of Orwell himself in this creature's timeless scepticism \" {{sfn|Dickstein |2007|p=141}} and indeed, friends called Orwell  \" Donkey George \" ,  \" after his grumbling donkey Benjamin, in ''Animal Farm''. \" {{sfn|Orwell|2006 |p=236}} \n \n ===Other animals=== \n * Muriel \u2013 A wise old goat who is friends with all of the animals on the farm. Similarly to Benjamin, Muriel is one of the few animals on the farm who is not a pig but can read. \n * The puppies \u2013 Offspring of Jessie and Bluebell, the puppies were taken away at birth by Napoleon and raised by him to serve as his powerful security force. \n * Moses \u2013 The Raven,  \" Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker. \" {{Sfn|Orwell|2009|p=35}} Initially following Mrs. Jones into exile, he reappears several years later and resumes his role of talking but not working. He regales Animal Farm's denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called  \" Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours! \"  Orwell portrays [[Religion and politics|established religion]] as  \" the black raven of priestcraft \u2013 promising pie in the sky when you die, and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power. \"  His preaching to the animals heartens them, and Napoleon allows Moses to reside at the farm  \" with an allowance of a gill of beer daily \" , akin to how Stalin brought back the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] during the Second World War.{{sfn|Dickstein|2007|p= 141}} \n * The sheep \u2013 They show limited understanding of Animalism and the political atmosphere of the farm, yet nonetheless they are the voice of blind conformity{{sfn|Dickstein|2007|p=141}} as they bleat their support of Napoleon's ideals with jingles during his speeches and meetings with Snowball. Their constant bleating of  \" four legs good, two legs bad \"  was used as a device to drown out any opposition or alternative views from Snowball, much as Stalin used hysterical crowds to drown out Trotsky.{{sfn|Meyers|1975|p=122}} Towards the latter section of the book, Squealer (the propagandist) trains the sheep to alter their slogan to  \" four legs good, two legs better, \"  which they dutifully do. \n * The hens \u2013 The hens are promised at the start of the revolution that they will get to keep their eggs, which are stolen from them under Mr. Jones. However, their eggs are soon taken from them under the premise of buying goods from outside Animal Farm. The hens are among the first to rebel, albeit unsuccessfully, against Napoleon. \n * The cows \u2013 The cows are enticed into the revolution by promises that their milk will not be stolen but can be used to raise their own calves. Their milk is then stolen by the pigs, who learn to milk them. The milk is stirred into the pigs' mash every day, while the other animals are denied such luxuries. \n * The cat \u2013 Never seen to carry out any work, the cat is absent for long periods and is forgiven because her excuses are so convincing and she  \" purred so affectionately that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions. \" {{sfn|Orwell|2009|p=52}} She has no interest in the politics of the farm, and the only time she is recorded as having participated in an election, she is found to have actually  \" voted on both sides. \"  {{sfn|Orwell|2009|p=25}} \n \n == Genre and style == \n George Orwell's ''Animal Farm'' is an example of a political satire that was intended to have a  \" wider application, \"  according to Orwell himself, in terms of its relevance. < ref name= \" :22 \" > {{Cite journal|last=Dwan|first=David|date=2012|title=Orwell's Paradox: Equality in ''Animal Farm''|journal=ELH|volume=79|issue=3|pages=655\u201383|doi=10.1353/elh.2012.0025|s2cid=143828269|issn=1080-6547}} < /ref >  Stylistically, the work shares many similarities with some of Orwell's other works, most notably ''1984,'' as both have been considered works of Swiftian Satire. < ref name= \" :32 \" > {{Cite journal|last=Crick|first=Bernard|date=December 31, 1983|title=The real message of '1984': Orwell's Classic Re-assessed |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=AWNB & docref=news/1139870DADC7F880|journal=Financial Times}} < /ref >  Furthermore, these two prominent works seem to suggest Orwell's bleak view of the future for humanity; he seems to stress the potential/current threat of dystopias similar to those in ''Animal Farm'' and ''1984''. < ref name= \" :42 \" > {{Cite web|url=https://rosariomariocapalbo.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/george-orwell-dystopian-novel-1984-animal-farm/|title=George Orwell: Dystopian Novel \u2013 1984 \u2013 Animal Farm |last=rosariomario|date=2011-04-10|website=Spazio personale di mario aperto a tutti 24 ore su|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}} < /ref >  In these kinds of works, Orwell distinctly references the disarray and traumatic conditions of Europe following the Second World War. < ref name= \" :52 \" > {{Cite journal|last=Orwell|first=George|title=Politics and the English Language|journal=Literary Cavalcade|volume=54|pages=20\u201326|id={{ProQuest|210475382}}}} < /ref >  Orwell's style and writing philosophy as a whole were very concerned with the pursuit of truth in writing. < ref name= \" :02 \" > {{Cite journal|last=KnowledgeNotes|date=1996|title=Animal Farm|journal=Signet Classic|id={{ProQuest|2137893954}}}} < /ref >  Orwell was committed to communicating in a way that was straightforward, given the way that he felt words were commonly used in politics to deceive and confuse. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  For this reason, he is careful, in ''Animal Farm'', to make sure the narrator speaks in an unbiased and uncomplicated fashion. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  The difference is seen in the way that the animals speak and interact, as the generally moral animals seem to speak their minds clearly, while the wicked animals on the farm, such as Napoleon, twist language in such a way that it meets their own insidious desires. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  This style reflects Orwell's close proximation to the issues facing Europe at the time and his determination to comment critically on Stalin's Soviet Russia. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / > \n \n == Background == \n \n === Origin and writing=== \n George Orwell wrote the manuscript between November 1943 and February 1944{{sfn|Orwell|2009}} after his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which he described in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938).

He was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the Ministry of Information had put out. The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, such as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination.{{sfn|Overy |1997 |p=297}} \n \n In the preface, Orwell described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm:{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}} \n {{quote \n |...I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat. \n }} \n \n In 1944 the manuscript was almost lost when a German [[V-1 flying bomb]] destroyed his London home.

Four publishers refused to publish ''Animal Farm'', yet one had initially accepted the work, but declined it after consulting the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].{{sfn|Freedom of the Press}}{{efn|[[#GOIT|Orwell 1976 p. 25 ''La libert\u00e0 di stampa'']]}} Eventually, [[Secker and Warburg]] published the first edition in 1945. \n \n During the [[World War II|Second World War]], it became clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch \u2013 including his regular publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. He also submitted the manuscript to [[Faber and Faber]], where the poet [[T. S. Eliot]] (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book's  \" good writing \"  and  \" fundamental integrity \" , but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint  \" which I take to be generally [[Deformed workers' state|Trotskyite]] \" . Eliot said he found the view  \" not convincing \" , and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue  \" what was needed... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs \" .{{sfn|Eliot|1969}} Orwell let [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]], who was working for Nicholson  &  Watson in 1944, read the typescript, and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson  &  Watson would want to publish it; however, they did not, and  \" lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in ''Animal Farm''. \" {{sfn|Orwell |2013|p= 231}} In his ''London Letter'' on 17 April 1944 for ''[[Partisan Review]]'', Orwell wrote that it was  \" now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-Russian printed. Anti-Russian books do appear, but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle. \" \n \n The publisher [[Jonathan Cape]], who had initially accepted ''Animal Farm'', subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry of Information warned him off{{sfn|Whitewashing of Stalin |2008}} \u2013 although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=337}} Writing to [[Leonard Moore (literary agent)|Leonard Moore]], a partner in the literary agency of Christy  &  Moore, publisher Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information. Such flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable, and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive. It may reasonably be assumed that the  \" important official \"  was a man named [[Peter Smollett]], who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent.{{sfn| Leab  |2007 |p= 3}}  Orwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka, and he would be one of the names Orwell [[Orwell's list|included in his list]] of Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to the [[Information Research Department]] in 1949. The publisher wrote to Orwell, saying:{{sfn|Whitewashing of Stalin |2008}} \n {{quote | \n If the fable were addressed generally to dictators and dictatorships at large then publication would be all right, but the fable does follow, as I see now, so completely the progress of the Russian Soviets and their two dictators [Lenin and Stalin], that it can apply only to Russia, to the exclusion of the other dictatorships. \n \n Another thing: it would be less offensive if the predominant caste in the fable were not pigs. I think the choice of pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many people, and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy, as undoubtedly the Russians are. \n }} \n \n [[Frederic Warburg]] also faced pressures against publication, even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the heroic [[Red Army]],{{sfn|Fyvel|1982 |p=139}} which had [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|played a major part]] in defeating [[Adolf Hitler]]. A Russian translation was printed in the paper ''Posev'', and in giving permission for a Russian translation of ''Animal Farm'', Orwell refused in advance all royalties.

Low had written a letter saying that he had had  \" a good time with ''ANIMAL FARM'' \u2013 an excellent bit of satire \u2013 it would illustrate perfectly. \"  Nothing came of this, and a trial issue produced by Secker  &  Warburg in 1956 illustrated by John Driver was abandoned, but the [[Folio Society]] published an edition in 1984 illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]] and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist [[Ralph Steadman]] was published by Secker  &  Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of ''Animal Farm''.{{sfn|Orwell|2001|p= 123 }}{{sfn|Orwell|2015|pp= 313\u201314}} \n \n ===Preface=== \n Orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British [[self-censorship]] and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally: \n {{quote|The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary....

Writing in the American ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' magazine, George Soule expressed his disappointment in the book, writing that it  \" puzzled and saddened me. It seemed on the whole dull. The allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly. \"  Soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real-world inspirations, and said,  \" It seems to me that the failure of this book (commercially it is already assured of tremendous success) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well \" .{{sfn|Soule|1946}} \n \n ''[[The Guardian]]'' on 24 August 1945 called ''Animal Farm''  \" a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few \" .{{sfn|Books of day|1945}}  [[Tosco Fyvel]], writing in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' on the same day, called the book  \" a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us. \"  [[Julian Symons]] responded, on 7 September,  \" Should we not expect, in ''Tribune'' at least, acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State \u2013 Soviet Russia? It seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky, and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author, upon a political ground. In a hundred years time perhaps, ''Animal Farm'' may be simply a fairy story; today it is a political satire with a good deal of point. \"  ''Animal Farm'' has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks.{{sfn|Orwell | 2015|p= 253}} \n \n The [[CIA]], from 1952 to 1957 in Operation Aedinosaur, sent millions of balloons carrying copies of the novel into Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down. < ref name= \" dalrymple20190824 \" > {{Cite magazine |last=Dalrymple |first=William |author-link=William Dalrymple (historian) |title=Novel explosives of the Cold War |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/08/novel-explosives-of-the-cold-war/ |magazine=The Spectator |archive-url=https://outline.com/X9SnJv |archive-date=2019-08-26}} < /ref > \n \n ''Time'' magazine chose ''Animal Farm'' as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005|p=}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]].{{Sfn|Modern Library|1998}} It won a [[Retro-Hugo|Retrospective Hugo Award]] in 1996 and is included in the [[Great Books of the Western World]] selection. < ref name= \" Western books \" / > \n \n Popular reading in schools, ''Animal Farm''  was ranked the nation's favourite book from school in a 2016 UK poll. < ref > {{cite news |title=George Orwell's Animal Farm tops list of the nation's favourite books from school |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/george-orwells-animal-farm-tops-list-of-the-nations-favourite-books-from-school-a6994351.html |access-date=15 December 2019 |work=The Independent}} < /ref > \n \n ''Animal Farm'' has also faced an array of challenges in school settings around the US. < ref name= \" :1 \" > {{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/classics|title=Banned  &  Challenged Classics|last=admin|date=2013-03-26|website=Advocacy, Legislation  &  Issues|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}} < /ref >  The following are examples of this controversy that has existed around Orwell's work: \n * The [[John Birch Society]] in Wisconsin challenged the reading of ''Animal Farm'' in 1965 because of its reference to masses revolting. < ref name= \" :1 \" / > < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.bannedlibrary.com/podcast/2017/1/22/animal-farm-and-other-books-not-meant-for-children|title=Animal Farm by George Orwell|website=Banned Library|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-15}} < /ref > \n * New York State English Council's Committee on Defense Against Censorship found that in 1968, ''Animal Farm'' had been widely deemed a  \" problem book. \" < ref name= \" :1 \"  / > \n * A censorship survey conducted in DeKalb County, Georgia, relating to the years 1979\u20131982, revealed that many schools had attempted to limit access to ''Animal Farm'' due to its  \" political theories. \" < ref name= \" :1 \"  / > \n * Superintendent in Bay County, Florida, bans ''Animal Farm'' at the middle school and high school levels in 1987. < ref name= \" :1 \"  / > \n ** The Board quickly brought back the book, however, after receiving complaints of the ban as  \" unconstitutional \" . < ref name= \" :1 \"  / > \n * ''Animal Farm'' was removed from the Stonington, Connecticut school district curriculum in 2017. < ref > {{cite news |last1=Wojtas |first1=Joe |title='Animal Farm' not banned, school officials say; parents not satisfied |url=https://www.theday.com/article/20170202/NWS01/170209792 |access-date=21 February 2021 |work=The Day |date=2 February 2017}} < /ref > \n \n ''Animal Farm'' has also faced similar forms of resistance in other countries. < ref name= \" :1 \" / >  The ALA also mentions the way that the book was prevented from being featured at the International Book Fair in Moscow, Russia, in 1977 and banned from schools in the United Arab Emirates for references to practices or actions that defy Arab or Islamic beliefs, such as pigs or alcohol. < ref name= \" :1 \" / > \n \n In the same manner, ''Animal Farm'' has also faced relatively recent issues in China.

Soon after, Napoleon and Squealer partake in activities associated with the humans (drinking alcohol, sleeping in beds, trading), which were explicitly prohibited by the Seven Commandments. Squealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation, an [[allusion]] to the Soviet government's revising of history in order to exercise control of the people's beliefs about themselves and their society.{{sfn|Rodden|1999|pages=48\u201349}} \n [[File:Animal Farm artwork.jpg|thumb|Squealer sprawls at the foot of the end wall of the big barn where the Seven Commandments were written (ch. viii) \u2013 preliminary artwork for a 1950 strip cartoon by [[Norman Pett]] and Donald Freeman]] \n \n The original commandments are: \n # Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. \n # Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. \n # No animal shall wear clothes. \n # No animal shall sleep in a bed. \n # No animal shall drink alcohol. \n # No animal shall kill any other animal. \n # All animals are equal. \n \n These commandments are also distilled into the maxim  \" Four legs good, two legs bad! \"  which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm, often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of Animalism. \n \n Later, Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law-breaking. The changed commandments are as follows, with the changes bolded: \n < ol start= \" 4 \" > \n < li > No animal shall sleep in a bed '''with sheets'''. < /li > \n < li > No animal shall drink alcohol '''to excess'''. < /li > \n < li > No animal shall kill any other animal '''without cause'''. < /li > \n < /ol > \n Eventually, these are replaced with the maxims,  \" All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others \" , and  \" Four legs good, two legs better \"  as the pigs become more human. This is an [[Irony|ironic]] twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans' evil habits. Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political [[dogma]] can be turned into malleable [[propaganda]].{{sfn|Carr|2010|pp=78\u201379}} \n \n ===Significance and allegory=== \n [[File:Flag_of_the_Animal_Farm.svg|thumb|left|The Horn and Hoof flag described in the book appears to be based on the [[hammer and sickle]], the Communist symbol.
