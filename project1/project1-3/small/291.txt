He was, however, dispossessed of both [[Macedon]] and [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] by [[Demetrius II of Macedon]], the son of Antigonus II; upon which he took refuge amongst the [[Acarnania]]ns. By their assistance and that of his own subjects, who entertained a great attachment for him, he recovered Epirus. It appears that he was in alliance with the [[Aetolia]]ns. < ref > {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alexander II.

On the death of Alexander, around 242 BC, Olympias assumed the regency on behalf of her sons, and married Phthia to Demetrius. < ref > ''Universal Pronouncing Dictionary of Biography and Mythology'', by Joseph Thomas - 1908 - page 90 < /ref >   There are extant silver and copper coins of this king.
