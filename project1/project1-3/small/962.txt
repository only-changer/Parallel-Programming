The latter had been murdered along with his mother [[Julia Soaemias]] by his own guards, who, as a mark of contempt, had their remains cast into the [[Tiber river]]. < ref > Dio, 60:20:2 < /ref >  Alexander and his cousin were both grandsons of [[Julia Maesa]], the sister of empress [[Julia Domna]], who had arranged for Elagabalus's acclamation as emperor by the [[Legio III Gallica|Third Gallic Legion]]. It was the rumor of Alexander's death that triggered the assassination of Elagabalus and his mother. < ref > Herodian, 5:8:5 < /ref > \n \n Alexander's 13-year reign was the longest reign of a sole emperor since [[Antoninus Pius]]. < ref > A handful of emperors since Antoninus Pius reigned for longer than 13 years, but for some or most of their reign they were co-emperors with others and therefore they were sole emperor for less than 13 years. < /ref >  He was also the second-youngest ever sole legal Roman emperor during the existence of the united empire, the youngest being [[Gordian III]]. Alexander's peacetime reign was prosperous. However, Rome was militarily confronted with the rising [[Sassanid Empire]] and growing incursions from the tribes of [[Germania]]. He managed to check the threat of the Sassanids. But when campaigning against [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], Alexander attempted to bring peace by engaging in diplomacy and bribery. This alienated many in the [[Roman Army|Roman army]], leading to a conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of Alexander, his mother [[Julia Avita Mamaea]], and his advisors. After their deaths, the accession of [[Maximinus Thrax]] followed. Alexander's death marked the [[epoch event]] for the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]\u2014nearly 50 years of civil wars, foreign invasion, and collapse of the monetary economy. \n \n ==Early reign== \n The future emperor Severus Alexander was born on 1 October 208 in [[Arqa|Arca Caesarea]], [[Phoenicia]].{{sfn|Benario}} Of his birth name, only two [[cognomen|cognomina]] are known, from literary sources: Bassianus ({{lang-grc-gre|\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2}}) according to the historian [[Cassius Dio]], and Alexianus ({{lang-grc-gre|\u0391\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2}}) according to [[Herodian]].

A new and menacing enemy started to emerge directly after Alexander's success in the Persian war. In 234, the barbarians crossed the Rhine and Danube in hordes that caused alarm as far as Rome. The soldiers serving under Alexander, already demoralized after their costly war against the Persians, were further discontented with their emperor when their homes were destroyed by the barbarian invaders. < ref > Campbell, 54 < /ref > \n \n As word of the invasion spread, the emperor took the front line and went to battle against the Germanic invaders. The Romans prepared heavily for the war, building a fleet to carry the entire army across. However, at this point in Alexander's career, he still knew little about being a general. Because of this, he hoped the mere threat of his armies would be sufficient to persuade the hostile tribes to surrender. < ref > {{cite web|title=Alexander Severus|url=http://www.roman-empire.net/decline/alex-severus-index.html|publisher=Capitoline Museums}} < /ref >   Severus enforced a strict military discipline in his men that sparked a rebellion among his legions. < ref name= \" Western Press Association \" > {{cite book|title=Library of World History: Containing a Record of the Human Race from the Earliest Historical Period to the Present Time; Embracing a General Survey of the Progress of Mankind in National and Social Life, Civil Government, Religion, Literature, Science and Art, Volume 3|publisher=Western Press Association|location=New York Public Library|page=1442}} < /ref >  Due to incurring heavy losses against the Persians, and on the advice of his mother, Alexander attempted to buy the Germanic tribes off, so as to gain time. < ref > Herodian, ''Roman history, book 6, chapter 7'' < /ref > \n \n It was this decision that resulted in the [[Legionary|legionaries]] looking down upon Alexander.

The first claims that the disaffection of Mamaea was the main motive behind the homicide. However, Lampridius makes it clear that he is more supportive of an alternative theory, that Alexander was murdered in Sicilia (located in Britain). < ref > Historia Augusta, ''Life of Severus Alexander'', 59:6 < /ref > \n \n This theory has it that, in an open tent after his lunch, Alexander was consulting with his insubordinate troops, who compared him to his cousin [[Elagabalus]], the divisive and unpopular Emperor whose own assassination paved the way for Alexander's reign. A German servant entered the tent and initiated the call for Alexander's assassination, at which point many of the troops joined in the attack. Alexander's attendants fought against the other troops but could not hold off the combined might of those seeking the Emperor's assassination. Within minutes, Alexander was dead. His mother Julia Mamaea was in the same tent with Alexander and soon fell victim to the same group of assassins. < ref name= \" Valentine Nind Hopkins 240 \" / > \n \n Alexander's body was buried together with the body of his mother Julia Manaea in a mausoleum in Rome. The actual mausoleum, called Monte di Grano, is the third largest in Rome behind those of [[Hadrian]] and [[Augustus]]. It is still visible in Piazza dei Tribuni, in the Quadraro area in Rome, where it resembles a large earth mound. The large sarcophagus found inside the tomb in the 16th century, and which contained the emperor's remains, is in the [[Palazzo dei Conservatori]] Museum in Rome. According to some sources inside the same sarcophagus in 1582 a precious glass urn was found, the [[Portland Vase]], currently on display at the [[British Museum]] in London. \n \n ==Legacy== \n [[File:Medaglione con effigie di alessandro severo, 1490 ca.JPG|thumb|15th-century depiction of Severus Alexander]] \n Alexander's death marked the end of the [[Severan dynasty]]. He was the last of the Syrian emperors and the first emperor to be overthrown by military discontent on a wide scale. < ref > Campbell, p. 55 < /ref >  After his death his economic policies were completely discarded, and the Roman currency was devalued; this signaled the beginning of the chaotic period known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], which brought the empire to the brink of collapse. < ref name= \" The Saylor Foundation \" / > \n \n Alexander's death at the hands of his troops can also be seen as the heralding of a new role for Roman emperors. Though they were not yet expected to personally fight in battle during Alexander's time, emperors were increasingly expected to display general competence in military affairs. < ref name= \" Campbell, pg. 69 \" > Campbell, p. 69 < /ref >  Thus, Alexander's taking of his mother's advice to not get involved in battle, his dishonorable and unsoldierly methods of dealing with the Germanic threat, and the relative failure of his military campaign against the Persians were all deemed highly unacceptable by the soldiers. < ref name= \" Campbell, pg. 69 \" > Campbell, p. 69 < /ref >  Indeed, Maximinus was able to overthrow Alexander by  \" harping on his own military excellence in contrast to that feeble coward \" . < ref name= \" Campbell, pg. 69 \" > Campbell, p. 69 < /ref >  Yet by arrogating the power to dethrone their emperor, the legions paved the way for a half-century of widespread chaos and instability. \n \n Although the Senate declared the emperor and his rule damned upon the report of his death and the ascension of a replacement emperor, Alexander was [[Apotheosis|deified]] after the death of Maximinus in 238. < ref > {{cite web|title=Severus Alexander|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Academic Edition.
