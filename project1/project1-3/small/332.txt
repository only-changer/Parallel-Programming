He was born in the castle of Mont P\u00e8lerin in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] while his father was on the [[First Crusade]]. He was given the name  \" Jourdain \"  after being baptised in the [[Jordan River]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} \n \n Alfonso's father died when he was two years old and he remained under the guardianship of his cousin, [[Guillaume Jourdain|William Jordan]], [[Count of Cerdagne]], until he was five. He was then taken to Europe, where his half-brother [[Bertrand of Toulouse|Bertrand]] had given him the county of Rouergue. Upon Bertrand's death in 1112, Alfonso succeeded to the county of Toulouse and marquisate of Provence. \n \n In 1114, Duke [[William IX of Aquitaine]], who claimed Toulouse by right of his wife Philippa, daughter of Count [[William IV of Toulouse|William IV]], invaded the county and conquered it. Alfonso recovered a part in 1119, but he was not in full control until 1123. When at last successful, he was [[excommunicated]] by [[Pope Callixtus II]] for having expelled the monks of [[Saint-Gilles, Gard|Saint-Gilles]], who had aided his enemies.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} \n \n [[File:Carte provence 1125.png|thumb|upright|left|Division of Provence obtained by Alfonso Jordan in 1125. He ruled the marquisate.]] \n \n Alfonso next had to fight for his rights in Provence against Count [[Raymond Berengar III of Barcelona]]. Not until September 1125 did their war end in  \" peace and concord \"  (''pax et concordia''). < ref > Adam Kosto, ''Making Agreements in Medieval Catalonia: Power, Order, and the Written Word, 1000\u20131200'' (Cambridge, 2001), 256\u201358. < /ref >  At this stage, Alfonso was master of the regions lying between the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Alps]], the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] and the sea. His ascendancy was, according to one commentator, an unmixed good to the country, for during a period of fourteen years art and industry flourished.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  \n In March 1126, Alfonso was at the court of [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n]] when he acceded to the throne.  \n According to the ''[[Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris]]'', Alfonso and [[Suero Verm\u00fadez]] took the city of [[Le\u00f3n, Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] from opposition magnates and handed it over to Alfonso VII.{{sfn|Barton|1997|pp=126\u201328|ps=. According to the ''Chronica'',  \" count Alfonso of Toulouse ... was in all things obedient to him [Alfonso VII] \"  (''comes Adefonsus Tolosanus ... in omnibus essent obedientes ei'').}} Among those who may have accompanied Alfonso on one of his many extended stays in Spain was the troubadour [[Marcabru]].{{sfn|Barton|1997|p=147}}{{sfn|Boissonade|1922}} \n \n [[File:Denier Narbonne Alphonse Jourdain.jpg|thumb|A ''[[French denier|denier]]'' minted at Narbonne during the minority of Ermengard (1134\u201343) bearing the obverse inscription DUX ANFOS and on the reverse CIVI NARBON]] \n \n About 1134 Alfonso seized the [[Viscount of Narbonne|viscounty of Narbonne]] and ruled it during the minority of the Viscountess [[Ermengarde of Narbonne|Ermengarde]], only restoring it to her in 1143.  \n In 1141 King [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] pressed the claim of Philippa on behalf of his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], even besieging Toulouse, but without result.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  \n That same year Alfonso Jordan was again in Spain, making a [[Way of Saint James|pilgrimage to Saint James of Compostela]], when he proposed a peace between the king of Le\u00f3n and [[Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of Navarre|Garc\u00eda VI of Navarre]], which became the basis for subsequent negotiations.{{sfn|Barton|1997|pp=140, 211}} \n \n In 1144, Alfonso again incurred the displeasure of the church by siding with the citizens of [[Montpellier]] against [[Lord of Montpellier|their lord]].  \n In 1145, [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] addressed a letter to him full of concern about a heretic named Henry in the diocese of Toulouse.  \n Bernard even went there to preach against the heresy, an early expression of [[Catharism]]. < ref > Walter Leggett Wakefield and Austin Patterson Evans, ''Heresies of the High Middle Ages'' (Columbia University Press, 1991), 122. < /ref >   \n A second time he was excommunicated; but in 1146 he took the cross (i.e., vowed to go on crusade) at a meeting in [[V\u00e9zelay]] called by Louis VII.  \n In August 1147, he embarked for the near east on the [[Second Crusade]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} \n He lingered on the way in Italy and probably in [[Constantinople]], where he may have met the Emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus|Manuel I]]. \n \n Alfonso finally arrived at [[Acre, Palestine|Acre]] in 1148.  \n Among his companions he had made enemies and he was destined to take no share in the crusade he had joined.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  \n He died at [[Caesarea]],{{sfn|Richard|1999|p=165}} and there were accusations of poisoning, usually levelled either against Eleanor of Aquitaine, wife of Louis, or [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]],{{sfn|Richard|1999|p=165}} the mother of King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]], who may have wanted to eliminate him as a rival to her brother-in-law [[Raymond II, Count of Tripoli|Raymond II]].  \n \n By his wife since 1125, Faydiva d'Uz\u00e8s, he left two sons and three daughters:  \n \n # [[Raymond V of Toulouse|Raymond]], who succeeded him,  \n # Alphonse,  \n # [[Faidiva of Toulouse|Faydiva]] (died 1154) married to Count [[Humbert III of Savoy]],  \n # Agnes (died 1187) and  \n # Laurentia, who married Count [[Bernard III of Comminges]].  \n \n He also had an illegitimate son, Bertrand of Toulouse.{{sfn|Lewis|2017|p=152}} \n \n ==Notes== \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n \n ==Sources== \n {{refbegin|30em}} \n *{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Barton |title=The Aristocracy in Twelfth-century Le\u00f3n and Castile |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997}} \n *{{cite book |first=Eloy |last=Benito Ruano |chapter=Alfonso Jord\u00e1n, Conde de Toulouse: un nieto de Alfonso VI de Castilla |title=Estudios sobre Alfonso VI y la reconquista de Toledo |location=Toledo |year=1987 |pages=83\u201398}} \n *{{citation |first=Eloy |last=Benito Ruano |url=http://dbe.rah.es/biografias/65061/alfonso-jordan |title=Alfonso Jord\u00e1n |encyclopedia=Diccionario Biogr\u00e1fico electr\u00f3nico |publisher=Real Academia de la Historia |year=2018}} \n *{{cite journal |first=Pierre |last=Boissonade |title=Les personnages et les \u00e9v\u00e9nements de l'histoire d'Allemagne, de France et d'Espagne dans l'oeuvre de Marcabru (1129\u201350) |journal=Romania |volume=48 |year=1922 |pages=207\u2013242}} \n *{{cite book |first=Fredric L. |last=Cheyette |title=Ermengard of Narbonne and the World of the Troubadours |year=2004 |publisher=Cornell University Press}} \n *{{EB1911|wstitle=Alphonse I.|volume=1|page=733}} \n *{{cite book |title=Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse |first1=John Hugh |last1=Hill |first2=Laurita Lyttleton |last2=Hill |publisher=Syracuse University Press |year=1962}} \n *{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Kevin James |year=2017 |title=The Counts of Tripoli and Lebanon in the Twelfth Century: Sons of Saint-Gilles |publisher=Routledge }} \n *{{cite book |title=Society and Government at Toulouse in the Age of the Cathars |last=Mundy |first=John Hine |publisher=Pontifical Institute for Medieval Studies |year=1997}} \n *{{cite book |first=Bernard F. |last=Reilly |title=The Kingdom of Le\u00f3n-Castilla Under King Alfonso VII, 1126\u20131157 |year=1998 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}} \n *{{cite book |title=The Crusades, c.1071-c.1291 |first=Jean |last=Richard |author-link=Jean Richard (historian) |translator-first=Jean |translator-last=Birrell |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 }} \n {{refend}} \n \n {{s-start}} \n {{s-bef|before=[[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond]]}}  \n {{s-ttl|title=[[County of Tripoli|Count of Tripoli]]|years=1105 & ndash;1109 < br > (regent & nbsp;[[William-Jordan]])}}  \n {{s-aft|after=[[Bertrand of Toulouse|Bertrand]]}} \n {{s-bef|before=[[Bertrand of Toulouse|Bertrand]]}}  \n {{s-ttl|title=[[Counts of Toulouse|Count of Toulouse]]|years=1112 & ndash;1148}}  \n {{s-aft|after=[[Raymond V of Toulouse|Raymond V]]}} \n {{s-end}} \n \n {{Toulouse Counts}} \n \n {{Authority control}} \n \n {{DEFAULTSORT:Alfonso Jordan}} \n [[Category:1103 births]] \n [[Category:1148 deaths]] \n [[Category:People temporarily excommunicated by the Catholic Church]] \n [[Category:Counts of Tripoli]] \n [[Category:Counts of Toulouse]] \n [[Category:Dukes of Narbonne]] \n [[Category:Margraves of Provence]] \n [[Category:Occitan nobility]] \n [[Category:House of Rouergue]] \n [[Category:Christians of the Second Crusade]]"
