'''Complementary medicine''' ('''CM'''), '''complementary and alternative medicine''' ('''CAM'''), '''integrated medicine''' or '''integrative medicine''' ('''IM'''), and '''holistic medicine''' are among many [[rebranding]]s of the same phenomenon. Alternative therapies share in common that they reside outside [[medical science]], and rely on [[pseudoscience]]. [[Traditional medicine|Traditional practices]] become  \" alternative \"  when used outside their original settings without proper scientific explanation and evidence. Frequently used derogatory terms for the alternative are '''new-age''' or '''pseudo''', with little distinction from [[quackery]]. \n \n Some alternative practices are based on theories that contradict the science of how the human body works; others resort to the [[supernatural]] or [[Superstition|superstitious]] to explain their effect. In others, the practice is plausibly effective but has too many [[side effect]]s. Alternative medicine is distinct from scientific medicine, which employs the [[scientific method]] to test plausible therapies by way of [[Guidelines for human subject research|responsible and ethical]] [[clinical trial]]s, producing [[evidence]] of either effect or of no effect. Research into alternative therapies often fails to follow proper research protocols (such as [[placebo]]-[[Scientific control|controlled]] trials, [[Blinded experiment|blind experiments]] and calculation of [[prior probability]]), providing invalid results. \n \n Much of the perceived effect of an alternative practice arises from a belief that it will be effective (the [[placebo effect]]), or from the treated condition resolving on its own ([[regression to the mean|the natural course of disease]]). This is further exacerbated by the tendency to turn to alternative therapies upon the failure of medicine, at which point the condition will be at its worst and most likely to spontaneously improve. In the absence of this bias, especially for diseases that are not expected to get better by themselves such as [[cancer]] or [[HIV/AIDS|HIV infection]], multiple studies have shown significantly worse outcomes if patients turn to alternative therapies. While this may be because these patients avoid effective treatment, some alternative therapies are actively harmful (e.g. [[cyanide]] poisoning from [[amygdalin]], or the intentional ingestion of [[hydrogen peroxide]]) or actively interfere with effective treatments. \n \n The alternative sector is a highly profitable industry with a strong lobby, and faces far less regulation over the use and marketing of unproven treatments. Its marketing often [[Appeal to nature|advertises the treatments as being  \" natural \" ]] or  \" [[wikt:holistic|holistic]] \" , in comparison to those offered by  \" [[Big Pharma conspiracy theory|big pharma]] \" . Billions of dollars have been spent studying alternative medicine, with few or no positive results. Some of the successful practices are only considered alternative under very specific definitions, such as those which include all [[physical activity]] under the umbrella of  \" alternative medicine \" .  \n {{TOC limit|3}} \n \n == Definitions and terminology == \n {{see also|Terminology of alternative medicine}} \n \n The terms ''alternative medicine'', ''complementary medicine'', ''integrative medicine,'' ''holistic medicine'', ''natural medicine'', ''unorthodox medicine'', ''fringe medicine'', ''unconventional medicine'', and ''[[new age]] medicine'' are used interchangeably as having the same meaning, and are almost synonymous in most contexts. < ref name= \" Shapiro 08 \" > {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ib_IbOu_d9gC & pg=PA1|title=Suckers: How Alternative Medicine Makes Fools of Us All|last=Shapiro|first=Rose|date=2010-09-30|publisher=Random House |isbn=9781409059165}} < /ref > < ref name= \" Bombardieri2000 \"  / > < ref name= \" Shuval2012 \"  / > < ref name= \" Freedman2011 \"  / >  Terminology has shifted over time, reflecting the preferred branding of practitioners. < ref name= \" SBM-brand \" > [https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/integrative-medicine-a-brand-not-a-specialty/  \" Integrative medicine \" : A brand, not a specialty].

An example of a placebo is an inert pill, but it can include more dramatic interventions like [[sham surgery]]. The ''placebo effect'' is the concept that patients will perceive an improvement after being treated with an inert treatment. The opposite of the placebo effect is the ''nocebo effect'', when patients who expect a treatment to be harmful will perceive harmful effects after taking it. \n \n Placebos do not have a physical effect on diseases or improve overall outcomes, but patients may report improvements in subjective outcomes such as pain and nausea. < ref name=CochraneHrob2010 > {{cite journal | vauthors = Hr\u00f3bjartsson A, G\u00f8tzsche PC | title = Placebo interventions for all clinical conditions | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = CD003974 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20091554 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003974.pub3 | pmc = 7156905 | editor1-last = Hr\u00f3bjartsson | editor1-first = Asbj\u00f8rn | url = http://nordic.cochrane.org/sites/nordic.cochrane.org/files/public/uploads/ResearchHighlights/Placebo%20interventions%20for%20all%20clinical%20conditions%20(Cochrane%20review).pdf}} < /ref >  A 1955 study suggested that a substantial part of a medicine's impact was due to the placebo effect. < ref name= \" Hrob2001 \" / > < ref name=CochraneHrob2010/ >  However, reassessments found the study to have flawed methodology. < ref name= \" Hrob2001 \" > {{cite journal | vauthors = Hr\u00f3bjartsson A, G\u00f8tzsche PC | title = Is the placebo powerless?

There are several socio-cultural reasons for the interest in these treatments centered on the low level of [[scientific literacy]] among the public at large and a concomitant increase in [[antiscience|antiscientific]] attitudes and [[new age]] [[mysticism]]. < ref name= \" Beyerstein \"  / >  Related to this are vigorous [[marketing]] < ref name= \" Weber \"  / >  of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics. < ref name= \" Beyerstein \"  / > < ref name= \" Beyerstein2001 \"  / >  Alternative medicine is criticized for taking advantage of the least fortunate members of society. < ref name= \" ConsumerHealth9th \" / > \n \n There is also an increase in [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] toward conventional medicine and pharmaceutical companies, < ref name= \" Li et al., 2018 \"  / >  mistrust of traditional authority figures, such as the physician, and a dislike of the current delivery methods of scientific biomedicine, all of which have led patients to seek out alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments. < ref name= \" Beyerstein2001 \"  / >  Many patients lack access to contemporary medicine, due to a lack of private or public [[health insurance]], which leads them to seek out lower-cost alternative medicine. < ref name= \" Barnes2004 \"  / >  Medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market. < ref name= \" Weber \"  / > \n \n Patients can be averse to the painful, unpleasant, and sometimes-dangerous [[adverse effect|side effects]] of biomedical treatments. Treatments for severe diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[HIV]] infection have well-known, significant side-effects. Even low-risk medications such as [[antibiotics]] can have potential to cause life-threatening [[anaphylactic]] reactions in a very few individuals. Many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach. In all of these cases, patients may be seeking out alternative therapies to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments. < ref name= \" Beyerstein \"  / > < ref name= \" Beyerstein2001 \"  / > \n \n ===Prevalence of use=== \n \n According to recent research, the increasing popularity of the CAM needs to be explained by moral convictions or lifestyle choices rather than by economic reasoning. < ref > {{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=H\u00e9l\u00e8ne|last2=Debons|first2=J\u00e9r\u00f4me|title=CAM and conventional medicine in Switzerland : divided in theory, united in practice.

They are, thus, considered safe on that count, but  \" their products are exempt from good manufacturing practice requirements related to expiration dating and from finished product testing for identity and strength \" , and their alcohol concentration may be much higher than allowed in conventional drugs. < ref name=Stehlin/ > \n \n ====Treatment delay==== \n \n Alternative medicine may discourage people from getting the best possible treatment. < ref name=MHTG/ >  Those having experienced or perceived success with one alternative therapy for a minor ailment may be convinced of its efficacy and persuaded to extrapolate that success to some other alternative therapy for a more serious, possibly life-threatening illness. < ref name= \" Navarro2006 \" / >  For this reason, critics argue that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous. According to mental health journalist [[Scott Lilienfeld]] in 2002,  \" unvalidated or scientifically unsupported mental health practices can lead individuals to forgo effective treatments \"  and refers to this as [[opportunity cost]]. Individuals who spend large amounts of time and money on ineffective treatments may be left with precious little of either, and may forfeit the opportunity to obtain treatments that could be more helpful. In short, even innocuous treatments can indirectly produce negative outcomes. < ref name=Lilienfeld2002/ >  Between 2001 and 2003, four children died in Australia because their parents chose ineffective naturopathic, homeopathic, or other alternative medicines and diets rather than conventional therapies. < ref name=Hughes2010/ > \n \n ====Unconventional cancer  \" cures \" ==== \n \n There have always been  \" many therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in [[biomedicine]].
