After this, a truce was agreed and Alyattes married his daughter [[Aryenis of Lydia|Aryenis]] to [[Astyages]], the son of Cyaxares.

Bury and Meiggs concluded that Ardys and Sadyattes reigned through an unspecified period in the second half of the 7th century BC, < ref > {{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | p=501}} < /ref >  but they did not propose dates for Alyattes except their assertion that his son [[Croesus]] succeeded him in 560 BC. The timespan 560\u2013546 BC for the reign of Croesus is almost certainly accurate. < ref > {{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | p=502}} < /ref > \n \n == Life == \n For several years Alyattes continued the war against the Greek colony of [[Miletus]] begun by his father [[Sadyattes]], but was obliged to turn his attention towards the [[Medes]] and [[Babylonians]]. On 28 May 585 BC, during the [[Battle of Halys (585 BC)|Battle of Halys]] fought against [[Cyaxares]], king of [[Media (region)|Media]], [[Eclipse of Thales|a solar eclipse]] occurred; hostilities were suspended, peace concluded, and the [[Halys River]] was fixed as the boundary between the two kingdoms. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / > \n \n Alyattes drove the [[Cimmerians]] from [[Asia Minor]], < ref name= \" H47 \" / >  with the help of [[war dogs]]. < ref > Polyaenus, 7.2 < /ref >  He further subdued the [[Carians]], and took several [[Ionia]]n cities, including [[Smyrna]] and [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]].

According to Herodotus, Sadyattes had invaded Miletus annually to burn their crops over the course of six years. The troops left the horses and houses untouched so that the Milesians could plant a new crop, which the Lydians would then burn the following year. Alyattes did the same over the next five years until the end of the war. < ref name= \" H47 \" > {{harvnb | Herodotus | de S\u00e9lincourt | 1954 | pp=47\u201348}} < /ref > \n \n The end came about because of a Lydian fire which, driven out of control by a strong wind, destroyed the temple of [[Athene]] at [[Assesos]]. Soon afterwards, Alyattes became seriously ill and decided to asked the Delphic Oracle for advice. The priestess refused to answer his emissary until the Lydians had rebuilt the temple. Alyattes immediately sent an embassy to Miletus and agreed a peace treaty. The temple was rebuilt and Alyattes recovered his health. < ref name= \" H47 \" / > \n \n ==References== \n {{reflist}} \n \n ==Sources== \n * {{cite book | last1=Bury | first1=J.
