A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist [[Osamu Tezuka]] and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, [[Original video animation|directly to home media]], and [[Original net animation|over the Internet]]. In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics ([[manga]]), [[light novels]], or [[Video games in Japan|video games]]. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences. \n \n Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.{{sfn|Craig|2000|pp=139\u2013140}} Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of  \" camera effects \" , such as panning, zooming, and angle shots.{{sfn|Craig|2000|pp=139\u2013140}} Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes. < ref > {{cite news |last=Ashcraft |first=Brian |date=21 September 2016 |title=A Serious Look at Big Anime Eyes |url=https://kotaku.com/a-serious-look-at-big-anime-eyes-1737751337 |work=[[Kotaku]] |access-date=4 January 2020}} < /ref > \n \n The anime industry consists of over [[List of anime companies|430 production companies]], including major studios like [[Studio Ghibli]], [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]], and [[Toei Animation]].

Tezuka's work\u2014and that of other pioneers in the field\u2014inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today.

In the 1990s, anime also began attracting greater interest in Western countries; major international successes include ''[[Sailor Moon (TV series)|Sailor Moon]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', both of which were [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] into more than a dozen languages worldwide.

Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used [[computer animation]] to improve the efficiency of the production process.

The animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to Osamu Tezuka, who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as [[Betty Boop]], who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|pp=6\u20137}} Tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history, whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes.{{sfn|Poitras|2000|p=60}} The artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth.

While anime has been licensed by its Japanese owners for use outside Japan since at least the 1960s, the practice became well-established in the United States in the late 1970s to early 1980s, when such TV series as ''[[Gatchaman]]'' and ''[[Captain Harlock]]'' were licensed from their Japanese parent companies for distribution in the US market. The trend towards American distribution of anime continued into the 1980s with the licensing of titles such as ''[[Voltron (1984 TV series)|Voltron]]'' and the 'creation' of new series such as ''[[Robotech]]'' through use of source material from several original series.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=11}} \n \n In the early 1990s, several companies began to experiment with the licensing of less children-oriented material. Some, such as [[A.D. Vision]], and [[Central Park Media]] and its imprints, achieved fairly substantial commercial success and went on to become major players in the now very lucrative American anime market. Others, such as [[AnimEigo]], achieved limited success. Many companies created directly by Japanese parent companies did not do as well, most releasing only one or two titles before completing their American operations. \n \n Licenses are expensive, often hundreds of thousands of dollars for one series and tens of thousands for one movie. < ref name= \" ADVcourt \" > ''[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-30/adv-court-documents-reveal-amounts-paid-for-29-anime-titles ADV Court Documents Reveal Amounts Paid for 29 Anime Titles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423194657/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-01-30/adv-court-documents-reveal-amounts-paid-for-29-anime-titles |date=April 23, 2012 }}'' < /ref >  The prices vary widely; for example, ''[[Jinki: Extend]]'' cost only $91,000 to license while ''[[Kurau Phantom Memory]]'' cost $960,000. < ref name= \" ADVcourt \" / >  Simulcast Internet streaming rights can be cheaper, with prices around $1,000-$2,000 an episode, < ref > ''[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-09 The Anime Economy Part 3: Digital Pennies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502060952/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-09 |date=May 2, 2015 }}'' < /ref >  but can also be more expensive, with some series costing more than {{USD|200,000}} per episode. < ref > {{cite web|url= https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2016-09-09/.106251|title= Why Are Funimation And Crunchyroll Getting Married?|first= Justin|last= Sevakis|date= September 9, 2016|access-date= September 10, 2016|work= [[Anime News Network]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160910033129/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2016-09-09/.106251|archive-date= September 10, 2016|url-status=live|df= mdy-all}} < /ref > \n \n The anime market for the United States was worth approximately $2.74 & nbsp;billion in 2009. < ref > {{cite web|url= https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-04-15/america-2009-anime-market-pegged-at-us%242.741-billion|title= America's 2009 Anime Market Pegged at US$2.741 & nbsp;Billion|date= April 15, 2011|access-date= December 29, 2013|work= [[Anime News Network]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131228095646/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-04-15/america-2009-anime-market-pegged-at-us%242.741-billion|archive-date= December 28, 2013|url-status=live|df= mdy-all}} < /ref >  Dubbed animation began airing in the United States in 2000 on networks like [[The WB Television Network|The WB]] and [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]].{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=18}} In 2005, this resulted in five of the top ten anime titles having previously aired on Cartoon Network.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=18}} As a part of localization, some [[Editing of anime in American distribution|editing]] of cultural references may occur to better follow the references of the non-Japanese culture. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://w3.salemstate.edu/~poehlkers/Emerson/Pokemon.html |title=Pokemon Case Study |publisher=W3.salemstate.edu |access-date=November 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820181118/http://w3.salemstate.edu/%7Epoehlkers/Emerson/Pokemon.html |archive-date=August 20, 2008 |url-status=live  }} < /ref >  The cost of English localization averages US$10,000 per episode. < ref > {{cite web|last=Oppliger|first=John|date=February 24, 2012|title=Ask John: Why Does Dubbing Cost So Much?|url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2012/02/24/ask-john-why-does-dubbing-cost-so-much/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619020459/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2012/02/24/ask-john-why-does-dubbing-cost-so-much/|archive-date=June 19, 2012|access-date=October 29, 2012|publisher=[[AnimeNation]]}} < /ref > \n \n The industry has been subject to both praise and condemnation for [[fansubs]], the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=206}} Fansubs, which were originally distributed on VHS bootlegged cassettes in the 1980s, have been freely available and disseminated online since the 1990s.{{sfn|Brenner|2007|p=206}} Since this practice raises concerns for copyright and piracy issues, fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten moral code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed.
