The [[Aegean Islands]] are located within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including [[Crete]] and [[Rhodes]]. The sea reaches a maximum depth of 3,544 meters, to the east of Crete. The [[Thracian Sea]] and the [[Myrtoan Sea]] are subdivisions of the Aegean Sea. \n \n The Aegean Islands can be divided into several island groups, including the [[Dodecanese]], the [[Cyclades]], the [[Sporades]], the [[Saronic Islands|Saronic islands]] and the [[North Aegean islands|North Aegean Islands]], as well as Crete and its surrounding islands. The Dodecanese, located to the southeast, includes the islands of Rhodes, [[Kos]], and [[Patmos]]; the islands of [[Delos]] and [[Naxos]] are within the Cyclades to the south of the sea. [[Lesbos]] is part of the North Aegean Islands. Euboea, the second-largest island in Greece, is located in the Aegean, despite being administered as part of [[Central Greece (region)|Central Greece]]. Nine out of twelve of the Administrative regions of Greece border the sea, along with the [[Provinces of Turkey|Turkish provinces]] of [[Edirne]], [[\u00c7anakkale|Canakkale]], [[Bal\u0131kesir]], [[Izmir]], [[Ayd\u0131n]] and [[Mu\u011fla Province|Mu\u011fla]] to the east of the sea. Various Turkish islands in the sea are [[Imbros]], [[Tenedos]], [[Cunda Island]], and the [[Fo\u00e7a Islands]]. \n \n The Aegean Sea has been historically important, especially in regards to the civilization of [[Ancient Greece]], who inhabited the area around the coast of the Aegean and the Aegean islands. The Aegean islands facilitated contact between the people of the area and between Europe and Asia. Along with the Greeks, [[Thracians]] lived among the northern coast. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered the area under the Roman Empire, and later the [[Byzantine Empire]] held it against advances by the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. The [[Fourth Crusade]] weakened Byzantine control of the area, and it was eventually conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]], with the exception of Crete, which was a Venetian colony until 1669. The [[Greek War of Independence]] allowed a Greek state on the coast of the Aegean from 1829 onwards. The Ottoman Empire held a presence over the sea for over 500 years, until it was replaced by modern [[Turkey]]. \n \n The rocks making up the floor of the Aegean are mainly limestone, though often greatly altered by volcanic activity that has convulsed the region in relatively recent geologic times. Of particular interest are the richly coloured sediments in the region of the islands of [[Santorini]] and [[Milos]], in the south Aegean. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >  Notable cities on the Aegean coastline include [[Athens]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Volos]], [[Kavala]] and [[Heraklion]] in Greece, and [[\u0130zmir]] and [[Bodrum]] in Turkey. The Aegean Sea groundwater itself has a high salinity content leading one to think that the soil would be infertile due to the volcanic region, but actually has an equilibrium with its soil content structure making it able to grow fertile crops on land that would seem infertile.  \n \n A number of issues concerning sovereignty within the Aegean Sea are disputed between Greece and Turkey. The [[Aegean dispute]] has had a large effect on [[Greek-Turkish relations]] since the 1970s. Issues include the delimitation of [[territorial waters]], [[national airspace]], [[exclusive economic zone]]s and [[flight information region]]s. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/aegean.htm|title=International Disputes|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=14 June 2019}} < /ref > \n \n ==Name and etymology== \n Late Latin authors referred the name ''Aegaeus'' to [[Aegeus]], who was said to have jumped into that sea to drown himself (rather than throwing himself from the Athenian acropolis, as told by some Greek authors). He was the father of [[Theseus]], the mythical king and founder-hero of [[Athens]]. Aegeus had told Theseus to put up white sails when returning if he was successful in killing the [[Minotaur]]. When Theseus returned, he forgot these instructions, and Aegeus thinking his son to have died then drowned himself in the sea. < ref > Hyginus, Fab. 43; Serv. Verg. A. 3.74; Scriptores rerum mythicarum Latini, ed. Bode, i. p. 117 (Second Vatican Mythographer 125). < /ref > \n \n The sea was known in Latin as ''Aegaeum mare'' under the control of the Roman Empire. The [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], who ruled many Greek islands in the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]], popularized the name ''Archipelago'' (Greek: \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, meaning  \" main sea \"  or  \" chief sea \" ), a name that held on in many European countries until the [[early modern period]].

The sea's maximum depth is {{convert|3543|m}}, located at a point east of [[Crete]]. The [[Aegean Islands]] are found within its waters, with the following islands delimiting the sea on the south, generally from west to east: [[Kythera]], [[Antikythera]], [[Crete]], [[Kasos]], [[Karpathos]] and [[Rhodes]]. The Anatolian peninsula marks the eastern boundary of the sea, while the Greek mainland marks the west. Several seas are contained within the Aegean Sea; the [[Thracian Sea]] is a section of the Aegean located to the north, the [[Icarian Sea]] to the east, the [[Myrtoan Sea]] to the west, while the [[Sea of Crete]] is the southern section. \n \n The Greek regions that border the sea, in alphabetical order, are [[Attica]], [[Central Greece]], [[Central Macedonia]], Crete, [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]], [[North Aegean]], [[Peloponnese (region)|Peloponnese]], [[South Aegean]], and [[Thessaly]]. The historical region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] also borders the sea, to the north. \n \n The Aegean Islands, which almost all belong to [[Greece]], can be divided into seven groups: \n # [[List of Aegean Islands#The North Aegean Islands|Northeastern Aegean Islands]], which lie in the [[Thracian Sea]] < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Aegean-Sea#ref170179|title=Aegean Sea {{!}} Mediterranean Sea|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=18 October 2017|language=en}} < /ref >   \n # [[Euboea|East Aegean Islands (''Euboea'')]]  \n # Northern [[Sporades]] \n # [[Cyclades]] \n # [[Saronic Islands]] (or ''Argo-Saronic Islands'') \n # [[Dodecanese]] (or ''Southern Sporades'') < ref > Administratively, the Greek Dodecanese also contains [[Kastellorizo]], situated further east outside the Aegean proper. < /ref > \n # [[Crete]] \n \n Many of the Aegean islands or island chains, are geographically extensions of the mountains on the mainland. One chain extends across the sea to Chios, another extends across Euboea to Samos, and a third extends across the Peloponnese and Crete to Rhodes, dividing the Aegean from the Mediterranean. \n \n The bays and gulfs of the Aegean beginning at the South and moving clockwise include on Crete, the [[Mirabello Bay|Mirabello]], [[Almyros Bay|Almyros]], [[Souda Bay|Souda]] and [[Gulf of Chania|Chania]] bays or gulfs, on the mainland the [[Myrtoan Sea]] to the west with the [[Argolic Gulf]], the [[Saronic Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Petalies Gulf]] which connects with the [[Gulf of Euboea|South Euboic Sea]], the [[Pagasetic Gulf]] which connects with the [[Gulf of Euboea|North Euboic Sea]], the [[Thermian Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Chalkidiki]] Peninsula including the [[Cassandra Gulf|Cassandra]] and the [[Singitic Gulf]]s, northward the [[Strymonian Gulf]] and the [[Gulf of Kavala]] and the rest are in [[Turkey]]; [[Saros Gulf]], [[Edremit (District), Bal\u0131kesir|Edremit]] Gulf, Dikili Gulf, [[Gulf of \u00c7andarl\u0131]], [[Gulf of \u0130zmir]], [[Gulf of Ku\u015fadas\u0131]], [[Gulf of G\u00f6kova]], [[G\u00fcll\u00fck]] Gulf. \n \n The Aegean sea is connected to the Sea of Marmara by the [[Dardanelles]], also known from Classical Antiquity as the Hellespont. The Dardanelles are located to the northeast of the sea. It ultimately connects with the [[Black Sea]] through the [[Bosporus|Bosphoros]] strait, upon which lies the city of [[Istanbul]].

According to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], most of the Aegean is classified as [[Mediterranean climate|Hot-summer Mediterranean]] (''Csa''), with hotter and drier summers along with milder and wetter winters. However, high temperatures during summers are generally not quite as high as those in arid or semiarid climates due to the presence of a large body of water. This is most predominant in the west and east coasts of the Aegean, and within the Aegean islands. In the north of the Aegean Sea, the climate is instead classified as [[Semi-arid climate|Cold semi-arid]] ''(BSk)'', which feature cooler summers than Hot-summer Mediterranean climates. \n The [[Etesian]] winds are a dominant weather influence in the Aegean Basin. \n \n The below table lists climate conditions of some major Aegean cities: \n {| class= \" wikitable \" \n |+'''Climate characteristics of some major cities on the Aegean coast''' \n ! rowspan= \" 3 \"  |City \n ! colspan= \" 4 \"  |Mean temperature (daily high) \n ! colspan= \" 6 \"  |Mean total rainfall \n |- \n ! colspan= \" 2 \"  |January \n ! colspan= \" 2 \"  |July \n ! colspan= \" 3 \"  |January \n ! colspan= \" 3 \"  |July \n |- \n !\u00b0C \n !\u00b0F \n !\u00b0C \n !\u00b0F \n !mm \n !in \n !days \n !mm \n !in \n !days \n |- \n |[[Alexandroupoli]] \n |8.4 \n |47.1 \n |30.1 \n |86.2 \n |60.4 \n |2.38 \n |6.8 \n |17.6 \n |0.69 \n |2.5 \n |- \n |[[Bodrum]] \n |15.1 \n |59.2 \n |34.2 \n |93.6 \n |134.1 \n |5.28 \n |12.3 \n |1.3 \n |0.05 \n |1.5 \n |- \n |[[Heraklion]] \n |15.2 \n |59.4 \n |28.6 \n |83.5 \n |91.5 \n |3.6 \n |10.1 \n |1.0 \n |0.04 \n |0.1 \n |- \n |[[Izmir]] \n |12.4 \n |54.3 \n |33.2 \n |91.8 \n |132.7 \n |5.22 \n |12.6 \n |1.7 \n |0.07 \n |0.4 \n |- \n |[[Thessaloniki]] \n |9.3 \n |48.7 \n |32.5 \n |90.5 \n |35.2 \n |1.39 \n |8.8 \n |27.3 \n |1.07 \n |3.8 \n |- \n | colspan= \" 11 \"  |Source: [[World Meteorological Organization]], < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://worldweather.wmo.int/europe.htm|title=World Weather Information Service \u2013 Europe|website=worldweather.wmo.int|access-date=16 June 2019}} < /ref >  [[Turkish State Meteorological Service]] < ref > [https://www.mgm.gov.tr/veridegerlendirme/il-ve-ilceler-istatistik.aspx?m=IZMIR  \" Resmi \u0130statistikler: \u0130llerimize Ait Genel \u0130statistik Verileri \" ] (in Turkish).

It represented the first advanced civilization in Europe, leaving behind massive building complexes, tools, stunning artwork, writing systems, and a massive network of trade. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195389661/obo-9780195389661-0071.xml;jsessionid=34C7E22759BF3739960486FE75375115|title=Ancient Crete \u2013 Classics \u2013 Oxford Bibliographies \u2013 obo|website=www.oxfordbibliographies.com|language=en|access-date=17 June 2019}} < /ref >  The Minoan period saw extensive trade between Crete, Aegean, and Mediterranean settlements, particularly the Near East. The most notable Minoan palace is that of [[Knossos]], followed by that of [[Phaistos]]. The Mycenaean Greeks arose on the mainland, becoming the first advanced civilization in mainland Greece, which lasted from approximately 1600 to 1100 BC. It is believed that the site of [[Mycenae]], which sits close to the Aegean coast, was the center of Mycenaean civilization. The Mycenaeans introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean, including the Aegean, was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their [[syllabic script]], the [[Linear B]], offers the first written records of the Greek language and [[Mycenaean religion|their religion]] already included several deities that can also be found in the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympic Pantheon]]. Mycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of [[palace]]-centered states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as ''[[wanax]]''. \n \n The civilization of Mycenaean Greeks perished with the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|collapse of Bronze Age culture]] in the eastern Mediterranean, to be followed by the so-called [[Greek Dark Ages]]. It is undetermined what cause the collapse of the Mycenaeans. During the Greek Dark Ages, writing in the Linear B script ceased, vital trade links were lost, and towns and villages were abandoned. \n \n === Ancient Greece === \n {{See also|Ancient Greece}} \n The [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] followed the Greek Dark Ages in the 8th century BC. Greece became divided into small self-governing communities, and adopted the [[Phoenician alphabet]], modifying it to create the [[Greek alphabet]]. By the 6th century BC several cities had emerged as dominant in Greek affairs: Athens, Sparta, [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], and [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]], of which Athens, Sparta, and Corinth were closest to the Aegean Sea. Each of them had brought the surrounding rural areas and smaller towns under their control, and Athens and Corinth had become major maritime and mercantile powers as well. In the 8th and 7th centuries BC many Greeks emigrated to form [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies]] in [[Magna Graecia]] ([[Southern Italy]] and [[Sicily]]), Asia Minor and further afield. The Aegean Sea was the setting for one of the most pivotal naval engagements in history, when on September 20, 480 B.C. the Athenian fleet gained a decisive victory over the Persian fleet of the [[Xerxes II of Persia]] at the [[Battle of Salamis]]. Thus ending any further attempt of western expansion by the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. < ref > {{Cite book |last=Herodotus |title=Histories. Book VIII |date=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |others=Bowie, Angus M. |isbn=978-0-521-57328-3 |location=Cambridge, UK |oclc=159628612 }} < /ref > \n \n The Aegean Sea would later come to be under the control, albeit briefly, of the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Kingdom of Macedonia]]. [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and his son [[Alexander the Great]] led a series of conquests that led not only to the unification of the Greek mainland and the control of the Aegean Sea under his rule, but also the destruction of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. After Alexander the Great's death, his empire was divided among his generals. [[Cassander]] became king of the Hellenistic kingdom of Macedon, which held territory along the western coast of the Aegean, roughly corresponding to modern-day Greece. The Kingdom of [[Lysimachus]] had control over the sea's eastern coast. Greece had entered the [[Hellenistic period]]. \n \n === Roman rule === \n The Macedonian Wars were a series of conflicts fought by the [[Roman Republic]] and its Greek allies in the eastern Mediterranean against several different major Greek kingdoms. They resulted in Roman control or influence over the eastern [[Mediterranean]] basin, including the Aegean, in addition to their hegemony in the western Mediterranean after the [[Punic Wars]]. During Roman rule, the land around the Aegean Sea fell under the provinces of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Thracia]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] and [[Crete and Cyrenaica|Creta et Cyrenica]] (island of Crete) \n \n === Medieval period === \n The [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] allowed its successor state, the [[Byzantine Empire]], to continue Roman control over the Aegean Sea. However, their territory would later be threatened by the [[Early Muslim conquests]] initiated by [[Muhammad]] in the 7th century. Although the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] did not manage to obtain land along the coast of the Aegean sea, its conquest of the Eastern Anatolian peninsula as well as Egypt, the Levant, and North Africa left the Byzantine Empire weakened. The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] expanded the territorial gains of the Rashidun Caliphate, conquering much of North Africa, and threatened the Byzantine Empire's control of Western Anatolia, where it meets the Aegean Sea. \n \n During the 820s, Crete was conquered by a group of [[Berbers]] [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] exiles led by [[Abu Hafs Umar al-Iqritishi]], and it became an independent [[Islamic]] state. The Byzantine Empire launched a campaign that took most of the island back in 842 and 843 under [[Theoktistos]], but the reconquest was not completed and was soon reversed. Later attempts by the [[Byzantine Empire]] to recover the island were without success. For the approximately 135 years of its existence, the emirate of Crete was one of the major foes of Byzantium. Crete commanded the sea lanes of the Eastern Mediterranean and functioned as a forward base and haven for Muslim corsair fleets that ravaged the Byzantine-controlled shores of the Aegean Sea. Crete returned to Byzantine rule under [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]], who launched a huge campaign against the Emirate of Crete in 960 to 961. \n \n Meanwhile, the [[Bulgarian Empire]] threatened Byzantine control of Northern Greece and the Aegean coast to the south. Under [[Presian I of Bulgaria|Presian I]] and his successor [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]], the Bulgarian Empire managed to obtain a small portion of the northern Aegean coast. [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]] led Bulgaria to its greatest territorial expansion, and managed to conqueror much of the northern and western coasts of the Aegean. The Byzantines later regained control. The Second Bulgarian Empire achieved similar success along, again, the northern and western coasts, under [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]]. \n \n The [[Seljuq Turks]], under the [[Seljuk Empire]], invaded the Byzantine Empire in 1068, from which they annexed almost all the territories of Anatolia, including the east coast of the Aegean Sea, during the reign of [[Alp Arslan]], the second [[Sultan]] of the [[Seljuk Empire]]. After the death of his successor, [[Malik Shah I]], the empire was divided, and Malik Shah was succeeded in Anatolia by [[Kilij Arslan I]], who founded the [[Sultanate of Rum]]. The Byzantines yet again recaptured the eastern coast of the Aegean. \n \n After [[Constantinople]] was occupied by Western European and Venetian forces during the [[Fourth Crusade]], the area around the Aegean sea was fragmented into multiple entities, including the [[Latin Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]], the [[Empire of Nicaea]], the [[Principality of Achaea]], and the [[Duchy of Athens]]. The Venetians created the maritime state of the [[Duchy of the Archipelago]], which included all the Cyclades except [[Mykonos]] and [[Tinos]]. The Empire of Nicaea, a Byzantine rump state, managed to effect the [[Recapture of Constantinople]] from the Latins in 1261 and defeat Epirus. Byzantine successes were not to last; the Ottomans would conquer the area around the Aegean coast, but before their expansion the Byzantine Empire had already been weakened from internal conflict. By the late 14th century the Byzantine Empire had lost all control of the coast of the Aegean Sea and could exercise power around their capital, Constantinople. The Ottoman Empire then gained control of all the Aegean coast with the exception of Crete, which was a Venetian colony until 1669. \n \n === Modern Period === \n The [[Greek War of Independence]] allowed a Greek state on the coast of the Aegean from 1829 onward. The Ottoman Empire held a presence over the sea for over 500 years until its [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|dissolution]] following [[World War I]], when it was replaced by modern [[Turkey]]. During the war, Greece gained control over the area around the northern coast of the Aegean. By the 1930s, Greece and Turkey had about resumed their present-day borders. \n \n In the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1912, Italy captured the Dodecanese islands, and had occupied them since, reneging on the 1919 [[Eleftherios Venizelos|Venizelos]]\u2013[[Tommaso Tittoni|Tittoni]] agreement to cede them to Greece. The Greco-Italian War took place from October 1940 to April 1941 as part of the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]] of [[World War II]]. The Italian war aim was to establish a Greek [[puppet state]], which would permit the Italian annexation of the [[Sporades]] and the [[Cyclades]] islands in the Aegean Sea, to be administered as a part of the [[Italian Aegean Islands]]. The German invasion resulted in the [[Axis occupation of Greece]]. The German troops evacuated Athens on 12 October 1944, and by the end of the month, they had withdrawn from mainland Greece. Greece was then liberated by Allied troops. \n \n ==Economy and politics== \n [[File:House of Cleopatra, Delos.jpg|thumb|House of Cleopatra on [[Delos]]]] \n Many of the islands in the Aegean have safe harbours and bays. In ancient times, navigation through the sea was easier than travelling across the rough terrain of the Greek mainland, and to some extent, the coastal areas of Anatolia. Many of the islands are [[Volcano|volcanic]], and marble and iron are mined on other islands. The larger islands have some fertile valleys and plains. \n \n Of the main islands in the Aegean Sea, two belong to Turkey & nbsp;\u2013 [[Bozcaada]] (Tenedos) and [[G\u00f6k\u00e7eada]] (Imbros); the rest belong to Greece. Between the two countries, there are [[Aegean dispute|political disputes]] over several aspects of political control over the Aegean space, including the size of territorial waters, air control and the [[delimitation]] of economic rights to the [[continental shelf]]. These issues are known as the [[Aegean dispute]]. \n \n === Transport === \n Multiple ports are located along the Greek and Turkish coasts of the Aegean Sea.
