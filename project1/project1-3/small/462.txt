  "{{short description|Chinese cuisine developed by Chinese Americans}} \n \n {{American cuisine}} \n {{Cuisine of China}} \n {{use American English|date=February 2019}} \n \n '''American Chinese cuisine''' is a style of [[Chinese cuisine]] developed by [[Chinese Americans]]. The dishes served in many North American [[Chinese restaurant]]s are adapted to American tastes and often differ significantly from those found in China. \n \n ==History== \n \n [[File:Theodore Wores - Chinese Restaurant.jpg|thumb|A Chinese restaurant in San Francisco's Chinatown in 1884]] \n \n [[Chinese emigration|Chinese immigrants]] arrived in the United States seeking employment as miners and railroad workers. As larger groups arrived, laws were put in place preventing them from owning land. They mostly lived together in ghettos, individually referred to as  \" [[Chinatowns in the United States|Chinatown]] \" . Here the immigrants started their own small businesses, including restaurants and [[Laundry#Chinese laundries in North America|laundry services]]. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >   \n \n By the 19th century, the Chinese community in [[San Francisco]] operated sophisticated and sometimes luxurious restaurants patronized mainly by Chinese. The restaurants in smaller towns (mostly owned by Chinese immigrants) served food based on what their customers requested, anything ranging from [[pork chop]] sandwiches and [[apple pie]], to beans and eggs. Many of these small-town restaurant owners were self-taught family cooks who improvised on different cooking methods using whatever ingredients were available. < ref name= \" :0 \" > {{cite book |title = The Globalization of Chinese Food|last1 = Wu|first1 = David Y.

First catering to miners and railroad workers, they established new eateries in towns where Chinese food was completely unknown, adapting local ingredients and catering to their customers' tastes. < ref > Ch Six,  \" The Globalization of Chinese Food: The Early Stages \" , in J.

By 1850, there were five Chinese  restaurants in San Francisco. Soon after, significant amounts of food were being imported from China to America's [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]]. \n \n The trend spread steadily eastward with the growth of the American railways, particularly to [[Chinese Americans in New York City|New York City]]. < ref name= \" Smith2009 \" > {{cite book|last=Smith|first=Andrew F.|title=Eating history: 30 turning points in the making of American cuisine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1514y0UnSdQC & pg=PA47|access-date=22 June 2011|date=1 October 2009|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14092-8|page=47}} < /ref >   The [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] allowed merchants to enter the country, and in 1915, restaurant owners became eligible for merchant visas.

Restaurants (along with Chinese laundries) provided an ethnic niche for small businesses at a time when Chinese people were excluded from most jobs in the wage economy by ethnic discrimination or lack of language fluency. < ref name= \" Coe Chop Suey \" > Andrew Coe ''Chop Suey: A Cultural History of Chinese Food in the United States'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009). < /ref >  By the 1920s, this cuisine, particularly chop suey, became popular among middle-class Americans. However, after World War II it began to be dismissed for not being  \" authentic \" .  \n \n Late 20th-century tastes have been more accommodating. {{sfnb|Hayford|2011| p = 11-12}} By this time it had become evident that Chinese restaurants no longer catered mainly to Chinese customers. < ref > {{cite web|title = China to Chinatown|url = http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/C/bo3536662.html|website = University of Chicago Press|access-date = 2015-12-10}} < /ref >  Chinese-American restaurants played a key role in ushering in the era of take-out and delivery food in America.  \n \n In New York City delivery was pioneered in the 1970s by Empire Szechuan Gourmet Franchise which hired Taiwanese students studying at [[Columbia University]] to do the work. Chinese American restaurants were among the first restaurants to use picture menus. < ref name= \" Pio Kuo \"  / > \n \n Beginning in the 1950s Taiwanese immigrants replaced Cantonese immigrants as the primary labor force in American Chinese restaurants.

Many who evacuated to Taiwan later moved to the United States as they lacked strong social networks and access to opportunity in Taiwan. Chefs from the Dachen Islands had a strong influence on American Chinese food. < ref name= \" Pio Kuo \"  / > \n \n Taiwanese immigration largely ended in the 1990s due to an economic boom and democratization in Taiwan.

This can be seen in the use of [[carrot]]s and [[tomato]]es.  Cuisine in China makes frequent use of Asian [[leaf vegetable]]s like [[bok choy]] and [[kai-lan]] and puts a greater emphasis on fresh [[meat]] and [[seafood]]. < ref name= \" Oxford \" > {{cite book   | title = The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink | author= Andrew F.

One such example is the common use of Western [[broccoli]] ({{zh|t=\u897f\u862d|p=x\u012bl\u00e1n}}) instead of Chinese broccoli ([[Gai-lan]], {{zh|t=\u82a5\u862d|p=ji\u00e8l\u00e1n|labels=no}}) in American Chinese cuisine. Occasionally, Western broccoli is also referred to as ''{{lang|yue|{{tonesup|sai1 laan4 fa1}}}}'' in Cantonese ({{zh|t=\u897f\u862d\u82b1|labels=no}}) in order not to confuse the two styles of broccoli. Among Chinese speakers, however, it is typically understood that one is referring to the leafy vegetable unless otherwise specified. \n \n This is also the case with the words for [[carrot]] (''luo buo'' or ''lo baak,'' or ''hong luo buo'', ''hong'' meaning  \" red \" ) and [[onion]] (''yang cong''). ''Lo baak'', in [[Cantonese]], can refer to several types of rod-shaped root vegetable including carrot, [[daikon]], green radish, or an umbrella term for all of them. The orange Western carrot is known in some areas of China as  \" foreign [[radish]] \"  (or more properly ''hung lo baak'' in Cantonese, ''hung'' meaning  \" red \" ).  \n \n When the word for onion, ''cong'', is used, it is understood that one is referring to  \" green onions \"  (otherwise known to English-speakers as  \" [[scallion]]s \"  or  \" spring onions \" ). The larger, many-layered onion [[bulb]] common in the United States is called ''yang cong''. This translates as  \" foreign onion \" . These names make it evident that the American broccoli, carrot, and onion are not indigenous to China, and therefore are less common in the traditional cuisines of China. \n \n [[Yeung Chow Fried Rice|Egg fried rice]] in American Chinese cuisine is also prepared differently, with more soy sauce added for more flavor whereas the traditional egg fried rice uses less soy sauce. Some food styles, such as [[dim sum]], were also modified to fit American palates, such as added batter for fried dishes and extra soy sauce. < ref name =  \" Oxford \" / > \n \n [[Salad]]s containing raw or uncooked ingredients are rare in traditional Chinese cuisine, as are Japanese style [[sushi]] or [[sashimi]].  However, an increasing number of American Chinese restaurants, including some upscale establishments, have started to offer these items in response to customer demand. \n \n [[Ming Tsai]], the owner of the Blue Ginger restaurant < ref > {{Cite web|title=Ming.com|url=https://www.ming.com/blue-ginger|access-date=2021-04-01|website=Ming.com|language=en-US}} < /ref >  in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], and host of [[PBS]] culinary show ''[[Simply Ming]]'', said that American Chinese restaurants typically try to have food representing 3-5 regions of China at one time, have [[chop suey]], or have  \" fried vegetables and some protein in a thick sauce \" ,  \" eight different sweet and sour dishes \" , or  \" a whole page of 20 different chow meins or fried rice dishes \" . Tsai said  \" Chinese-American cuisine is 'dumbed-down' Chinese food. It's adapted... to be blander, thicker and sweeter for the American public \" . < ref > \" [https://cnneatocracy.wordpress.com/2011/01/19/chef-ming-tsai-wants-you-to-have-a-chinese-friend/ Chef Ming Tsai wants you to have a Chinese friend] \" .

Chow mein consists of fried crispy noodles with bits of meat and vegetables. It can come with chicken, pork, shrimp or beef. \n * [[Egg foo young]]\u2014a Chinese-style omelet with vegetables and meat, usually served with a brown gravy.

Thick, spaghetti-shaped noodles are pan fried with vegetables (mainly bok choy and Chinese cabbage [ < nowiki/ > [[Napa cabbage|napa]]]) and meat. Sometimes this dish is referred to as chow mein (which literally means  \" stir-fried noodles \"  in Cantonese). \n * [[Rice vermicelli#Mainland China|Mei Fun]]\u2014noodles usually [[Simmering|simmered]] in [[broth]] with other ingredients such as [[Fish ball|fish balls]], [[Beef ball|beef balls]], and/or [[Fish slice|fish slices]]. \n * [[Moo shu pork]]\u2014the original version uses more typically Chinese ingredients (including [[Cloud ear fungus|wood ear]] fungi and [[daylily]] buds) and thin flour pancakes, while the American version uses vegetables more familiar to Americans, and thicker pancakes.

Many Chinatown areas also feature [[Chinese bakery products|Chinese bakeries]], [[boba milk tea]] shops, [[siu mei|roasted meat]], [[Chinese Buddhist cuisine|vegetarian cuisine]], and specialized dessert shops. \n \n [[Chop suey]] is not widely available in [[San Francisco]], and the area's chow mein is different from [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] chow mein. \n \n ===Boston=== \n Chinese cuisine in [[Boston]] results from a combination of economic and regional factors. The growing [[Chinatown, Boston|Boston Chinatown]] accommodates [[Chinatown bus lines|Chinese-owned bus lines]] shuttling an increasing number of passengers to and from the numerous [[Chinese Americans in New York City|Chinatowns in New York City]], and this has led to some exchange between Boston Chinese cuisine and that in New York.  \n \n A large immigrant [[Fujianese people|Fujianese]] immigrant population has made a home in Boston, leading to [[Fuzhou cuisine]] being readily available there. An increasing [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] population has also had an influence on Chinese cuisine in [[Greater Boston]].  \n \n Finally, innovative dishes incorporating [[chow mein]] and [[chop suey]] as well as [[farm-to-table|locally farmed]] produce and regionally procured [[seafood]] are found in Chinese as well as non-Chinese food in and around Boston. \n \n [[Joyce Chen (chef)|Joyce Chen]] introduced northern Chinese (Mandarin) and Shanghainese dishes to Boston in the 1950s, including [[Peking duck]], [[moo shu pork]], [[hot and sour soup]], and [[potstickers]], which she called  \" Peking Ravioli \"  or  \" Ravs \" . < ref name=Mennies > {{cite web|last1=Mennies|first1=Leah|title=The Story of Peking Ravioli|url=http://luckypeach.com/the-story-of-peking-ravioli|website=Lucky Peach|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317230442/http://luckypeach.com/the-story-of-peking-ravioli/|archive-date=March 17, 2015}} < /ref >  Her restaurants would be frequented by early workers on the [[ARPANET]], < ref > [[Katie Hafner|Hafner, K.]],  &  Lyon, M.
