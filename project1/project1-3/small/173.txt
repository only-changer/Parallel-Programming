The son of a [[pottery|potter]] who had moved to Syracuse in about 343 BC, he learned his father's trade, but afterwards entered the army along with his brother [[Antander]]. In 333 BC he married the [[widow]] of his patron Damas, a distinguished and wealthy citizen. He was twice [[Exile|banished]] for attempting to overthrow the [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] party in Syracuse.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} \n \n In 317 BC he returned with an army of [[mercenary|mercenaries]] under a solemn oath to observe the [[democracy|democratic]] [[constitution]] which was established after they took the city. Having massacred the oligarchs and the richest of the citizenry, he thus made himself master of Syracuse, and he created a strong army and fleet and subdued the greater part of Sicily.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} \n \n War with [[Carthage]] followed. In 311 BC Agathocles was defeated in the [[Battle of the Himera River (311 BC)|Battle of the Himera River]] and [[siege|besieged]] in Syracuse. In 310 BC he made a desperate effort to break through the [[blockade]] and attack Carthage. He landed at [[Cap Bon]] in August 310 BC, and was able to defeat the Carthaginians for the first time, and establish a camp near [[Tunis]]. He then turned east, and tried to take over trading coastal cities such as [[Nabeul|Neapolis]] and [[Hadrumetum]], and on this occasion concluded an alliance with [[Ailymas]], king of the [[Berber people|Libyans]] according to [[Diodorus of Sicily]], in an attempt to surround and isolate Carthage. After capturing Hadrumetum, [[Thapsus]] and other coastal towns, Agathocles turned his attention to central Tunisia. Before or during this campaign, he broke his alliance with Ailymas, whom he pursued and killed, but he kept his [[Numidia|Numidian]] army, including war chariots they built. < ref name= \" ailymas \" > {{Cite web|url=https://journals.openedition.org/encyclopedieberbere/833?lang=en|title=Encyclop\u00e9die Berb\u00e8re, Ailymas, G. Camps|access-date=6 January 2021}} < /ref > \n \n In 309/8 BC, Agathocles turned his attention towards [[Ophellas]], ruler of [[Cyrenaica]] as likely to prove a useful ally in his war against the Carthaginians. In order to gain him over he promised to cede to him whatever conquests their combined forces might make in Africa, reserving to himself only the possession of Sicily. < ref > Diodorus xx. 40.1-4 < /ref >  Ophellas gathered a powerful army from the homeland of his wife Euthydike (a descendant of [[Miltiades]]), [[Athens]], where many citizens felt disgruntled after having lost their voting rights.{{sfn|Habicht|1998|p=95}} Notwithstanding all the natural obstacles which presented themselves on his route, Ophellas succeeded in reaching the Carthaginian territories after a toilsome and perilous march of more than two months' duration. < ref > Diodorus xx. 41-42 < /ref >  He was received by Agathocles with every demonstration of friendship, and the two armies encamped near each other: but not many days had elapsed when Agathocles betrayed his new ally, attacked the camp of the Cyrenaeans, and had Ophellas himself killed. < ref > Diodorus xx. 42.4-5; 43.3-4 < /ref >  The Cyrenean troops, left without a leader, went over to Agathocles.{{sfn|Habicht|1998|p=95}} \n \n Following several victories he was at last completely defeated (307 BC) and fled secretly to Sicily.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} After concluding peace with Carthage in 306 BC, Agathocles styled himself king of Sicily in 304 BC, and established his rule over the [[Greece|Greek]] cities of the island more firmly than ever. A peace treaty with Carthage left him in control of Sicily east of the [[Halycus|Halycus River]]. Even in his old age he displayed the same restless energy, and is said to have been contemplating a fresh attack on Carthage at the time of his death. \n \n His last years were plagued by ill-health and the turbulence of his grandson [[Archagathus (grandson of Agathocles of Syracuse)|Archagathus]], at whose instigation he is said to have been [[poison]]ed; according to others, he died a natural death. He was a born leader of mercenaries, and, although he did not shrink from cruelty to gain his ends, he afterwards showed himself a mild and popular  \" tyrant \" . Agathocles restored the Syracusan democracy on his death bed and did not want his sons to succeed him as king. \n \n Agathocles was married three times. His first wife was the widow of his patron Damas by whom he had two sons: [[Archagathus (son of Agathocles of Syracuse)|Archagathus]] and his brother, who were both murdered in 307 BC. His second wife was Alcia and they had a daughter called [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]], who married as the second wife of King [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], and a son, Agathocles, who was murdered in a succession dispute shortly before his father's death. His third wife was the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Greek Ptolemaic Princess]] [[Theoxena of Syracuse|Theoxena]], who was the second daughter of [[Berenice I of Egypt|Berenice I]] from her first husband [[Philip (first husband of Berenice I of Egypt)|Philip]] and was a stepdaughter of [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. Theoxena bore Agathocles two children: [[Archagathus of Libya|Archagathus]] and [[Theoxena of Egypt|Theoxena]]. Theoxena survived Agathocles. He had further descendants from his second and third marriage. \n \n ==Legacy== \n Agathocles was cited as an example  \" Of Those Who By Their Crimes Come to Be Princes \"  in Chapter VIII of [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]'s treatise on politics -  ''[[The Prince]]'' (1513).  \n He was described as behaving as a criminal at every stage of his career. Machiavelli claimed: {{quote|Agathocles, the Sicilian, became King of Syracuse not only from a private but from a low and abject position. This man, the son of a potter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous life. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of mind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession, he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. < ref > [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1232/1232-h/1232-h.htm#link2HCH0008 ''The Prince'', Chapter VIII] < /ref > }} \n \n Machiavelli goes on to reason that Agathocles' success, in contrast to other criminal tyrants, was due to his ability to commit his crimes quickly and ruthlessly, and states that cruelties are best used when they \n {{quote|are applied at one blow and are necessary to one's security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects.}} \n However, he came to  \" glory \"  as much as he did brutality by repelling invading Carthaginians and winning the loyalty of the denizens of his land. \n \n ==Family tree of Agathocles== \n {{tree chart/start}} \n {{tree chart| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Mag |y| Ant |Mag=[[Magas of Macedon|Magas]]|Ant=[[Antigone of Macedon]]}} \n {{tree chart| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| }} \n {{tree chart| | | | | | | | | Car | | | | | | Phi |y|~|~|~|~| Be1 |~|~|~|~|y| Pt1 |Phi=[[Philip (husband of Berenice I of Egypt)|Philip]]|Car=Carcinus of Regium|Be1=[[Berenice I of Egypt|Berenice I]]|Pt1=[[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy I]] < br/ > king of Egypt}} \n {{tree chart| | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | | | |`|-|.| }} \n {{tree chart| unk |y|~|~|~|~| Aga |~|~|~|y|~| Tho | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | Pt2 |unk=1.(unknown)|Aga=Agathocles I < br/ > tyrant of Syracuse, < br/ > king of Sicily|Tho=3.[[Theoxena of Syracuse|Theoxena]] Elder|Pt2=[[Ptolemy II of Egypt|Ptolemy II]] < br/ > king of Egypt}} \n {{tree chart| | | |!| Alc |y|J| | | | | |`|-|-|-|-|-|-|t|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | ||!| Alc=2.Alcia }} \n {{tree chart| |,|-|^|-|.| |`|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |!| | | |!| | | |!| | | |!| }} \n {{tree chart| Arc | | Her | | Ag2 | | Lan |~| Py1 |~| Ang | | Arg | | The | | Pt3 |Arc=[[Archagathus (son of Agathocles of Syracuse)|Archagathus]] Elder < br/ > general < br/ > < small > \u221e Theoxena < /small > |Her=[[Heracleides (307 BC)|Hercleides]] < br/ > military officer|Ang=[[Antigone of Epirus|Antigone]]|Ag2=Agathocles II|Lan=[[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]]|Py1=[[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus I]] < br/ > king of Epirus|Arg=[[Archagathus of Libya]] < br/ > epistates of Cyrenaica < br/ > < small > \u221e Oenanthe < /small > |The=[[Theoxena of Egypt|Theoxena]] Younger|Pt3=[[Ptolemy III Euergetes|Ptolemy III]] < br/ > king of Egypt}} \n {{tree chart| |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | |!| }} \n {{tree chart| Arh | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Agl | | Pt4 |Arh=[[Archagathus (grandson of Agathocles of Syracuse)|Archagathus]] Younger < br/ > military officer|Agl=[[Agathocles (grandson of Agathocles of Syracuse)|Agathocles]] Elder < br/ > < small > \u221e [[Oenanthe of Egypt|Oenanthe]] < /small > |Pt4=[[Ptolemy IV Philopator|Ptolemy IV]] < br/ > king of Egypt}} \n {{tree chart| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|(| | | |!| }} \n {{tree chart| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Aga | | Ags | | Pt5 |Aga=[[Agathoclea (mistress of Ptolemy IV)|Agathoclea]]|Ags=[[Agathocles of Egypt|Agathocles]] Younger|Pt5=[[Ptolemy V Epiphanes|Ptolemy V]] < Br/ > king of Egypt}} \n {{tree chart/end}} \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n \n ==Primary sources== \n * [[Diodorus Siculus]] ''Library of History'' Books 19\u201321. \n * [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], ''Epitome of Pompeius Trogus'' Book 22. \n * [[Polyaenus]] 5.3 \n * [[Polybius]] 9.23 \n \n ==Bibliography== \n *{{EB1911|wstitle=Agathocles|volume=1|page=370}} \n *{{cite book |last1=Tillyard |first1=H.J.W. |title=The History of Agathocles |date=1908 |publisher=CUP |location=Cambridge |url=http://www.third-millennium-library.com/readinghall/GalleryofHistory/AGATHOCLES/DOOR.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215164619/http://www.third-millennium-library.com/readinghall/GalleryofHistory/AGATHOCLES/DOOR.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-12-15 }} \n *{{cite book |last1=Meister |first1=Klaus |editor1-last=Walbank |editor1-first=F.
