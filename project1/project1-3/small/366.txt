In other words, an alkane consists of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon]] atoms arranged in a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] structure in which all the [[carbon\u2013carbon bond]]s are [[Single bond|single]]. < ref name= \" GoldBook alkanes \" / >  Alkanes have the general chemical formula C < sub > ''n'' < /sub > H < sub > 2''n''+2 < /sub > . The alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of [[methane]] (CH < sub > 4 < /sub > ), where ''n'' & nbsp;= & nbsp;1 (sometimes called the parent molecule), to arbitrarily large and complex molecules, like [[Higher alkanes#Nonatetracontane to tetrapentacontane|pentacontane]] (C < sub > 50 < /sub > H < sub > 102 < /sub > ) or 6-ethyl-2-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl) octane, an [[isomer]] of [[tetradecane]] (C < sub > 14 < /sub > H < sub > 30 < /sub > ). \n \n The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) defines alkanes as  \" acyclic branched or unbranched hydrocarbons having the general formula {{Carbon}} < sub > ''n'' < /sub > {{Hydrogen}} < sub > 2''n''+2 < /sub > , and therefore consisting entirely of hydrogen atoms and saturated carbon atoms \" . However, some sources use the term to denote ''any'' saturated hydrocarbon, including those that are either monocyclic (i.e. the [[cycloalkane]]s) or polycyclic, < ref > {{cite web|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Core/Organic_Chemistry/Hydrocarbons/Alkanes |title=Alkanes|date=28 November 2016|website = Chemistry LibreTexts}} < /ref >  despite their having a distinct general formula (i.e. cycloalkanes are C < sub > ''n'' < /sub > H < sub > 2''n'' < /sub > ). \n \n In an alkane, each carbon atom is [[Orbital hybridisation|sp < sup > 3 < /sup > -hybridized]] with 4 [[sigma bond]]s (either C\u2013C or [[Carbon\u2013hydrogen bond|C\u2013H]]), and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms (in a C\u2013H bond). The longest series of linked carbon atoms in a molecule is known as its [[Skeletal formula|carbon skeleton]] or carbon backbone. The number of carbon atoms may be considered as the size of the alkane. \n \n One group of the [[higher alkanes]] are [[wax]]es, solids at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard ambient temperature and pressure]] (SATP), for which the number of carbon atoms in the carbon backbone is greater than about 17. \n With their repeated \u2013CH < sub > 2 < /sub >  units, the alkanes constitute a [[homologous series]] of organic compounds in which the members differ in [[molecular mass]] by multiples of 14.03 & nbsp;[[Dalton (unit)|u]] (the total mass of each such [[Methylene bridge|methylene-bridge]] unit, which comprises a single carbon atom of mass 12.01 & nbsp;u and two hydrogen atoms of mass ~1.01 & nbsp;u each). \n \n Methane is produced by [[Methanogen|methanogenic bacteria]] and some long-chain alkanes function as pheromones in certain animal species or as protective waxes in plants and fungi. Nevertheless, most alkanes do not have much [[biological activity]].  They can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more active/reactive [[functional group]]s of biological molecules. \n \n The alkanes have two main commercial sources: [[petroleum]] (crude oil) and [[natural gas]]. \n \n An [[alkyl]] group is an alkane-based molecular fragment that bears one open valence for bonding. They are generally abbreviated with the symbol for any organyl group, R, although Alk is sometimes used to specifically symbolize an alkyl group (as opposed to an alkenyl group or aryl group). \n \n ==Structure and classification== \n Ordinarily the C-C single bond distance is 1.53 \u00c5. < ref > {{March6th|page=23}} < /ref >   \n Saturated hydrocarbons can be linear, branched, or [[Cyclic compound|cyclic]]. The third group is sometimes called [[cycloalkane]]s. < ref name= \" GoldBook alkanes \" > {{GoldBookRef | title=alkanes | file = A00222}} < /ref >  Very complicated structures are possible by combining linear, branch, cyclic alkanes. \n \n ==Isomerism== \n [[Image:Saturated C4 hydrocarbons ball-and-stick.png|thumb|right| C < sub > 4 < /sub >  alkanes and cycloalkanes (left to right): [[n-butane|''n''-butane]] and [[isobutane]] are the two C < sub > 4 < /sub > H < sub > 10 < /sub >  isomers; [[cyclobutane]] and [[methylcyclopropane]] are the two C < sub > 4 < /sub > H < sub > 8 < /sub >  alkane isomers. < br / >  [[Bicyclobutane|Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane]] is the only C < sub > 4 < /sub > H < sub > 6 < /sub >  alkane and has no alkane isomer; [[tetrahedrane]] (below) is the only C < sub > 4 < /sub > H < sub > 4 < /sub >  alkane and so has no alkane isomer.]] \n \n [[File:Tetrahedrane-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|100px|[[Tetrahedrane]] ]] \n \n Alkanes with more than three [[carbon]] atoms can be arranged in various ways, forming [[structural isomer]]s. The simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches. This isomer is sometimes called the ''n''-isomer (''n'' for  \" normal \" , although it is not necessarily the most common). However the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points. The number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms. For example, for acyclic alkanes: < ref name= OEIS  > [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] {{OEIS|id=A000602}} < /ref > \n * C < sub > 1 < /sub > : [[methane]] only \n * C < sub > 2 < /sub > : [[ethane]] only \n * C < sub > 3 < /sub > : [[propane]] only \n * C < sub > 4 < /sub > : 2 isomers: [[butane]] and [[isobutane]] \n * C < sub > 5 < /sub > : 3 isomers: [[pentane]], [[isopentane]], and [[neopentane]] \n * C < sub > 6 < /sub > : 5 isomers: [[hexane]], [[2-Methylpentane|2-methylpentane]], [[3-Methylpentane|3-methylpentane]], [[2,2-Dimethylbutane|2,2-dimethylbutane]], and [[2,3-Dimethylbutane|2,3-dimethylbutane]] \n * C < sub > 7 < /sub > : 9 isomers: [[heptane]], [[methylhexane]] (2 isomers), [[dimethylpentane]] (4 isomers), [[3-Ethylpentane|3-ethylpentane]], [[2,2,3-trimethylbutane]] \n * C < sub > 12 < /sub > : 355 isomers \n * C < sub > 32 < /sub > : 27,711,253,769 isomers \n * C < sub > 60 < /sub > : 22,158,734,535,770,411,074,184 isomers, many of which are not stable. \n \n Branched alkanes can be [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]. For example, [[3-methylhexane]] and its higher [[Homology (chemistry)|homologues]] are chiral due to their [[stereogenic center]] at carbon atom number 3. The above list only includes differences of connectivity, not stereochemistry. In addition to the alkane isomers, the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more rings. Such compounds are called [[cycloalkane]]s, and are also excluded from the above list because changing the number of rings changes the [[molecular formula]]. [[Cyclobutane]] and [[methylcyclopropane]] are isomers of each other, but are not isomers of butane.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} \n \n ==Nomenclature== \n {{Main|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry}} \n The [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Alkanes|IUPAC nomenclature]] (systematic way of naming compounds) for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains.

Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers, e.g.,  \" [[butane|''n''-butane]] \"  rather than simply  \" butane \"  to distinguish it from [[isobutane]].

Cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms in their backbones, e.g., [[cyclopentane]] (C < sub > 5 < /sub > H < sub > 10 < /sub > ) is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like [[pentane]] (C < sub > 5 < /sub > H < sub > 12 < /sub > ), but they are joined up in a five-membered ring.

Together, alkanes are known as the 'paraffin series'. Trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts. They were coined before the development of systematic names, and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry. Cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} \n \n It is almost certain that the term 'paraffin' stems from the [[petrochemical industry]]. Branched-chain alkanes are called '''isoparaffins'''. The use of the term  \" paraffin \"  is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of [[isomer]]s, i.e., compounds of the same [[chemical formula]], e.g., [[pentane]] and [[isopentane]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} \n \n ;In IUPAC \n The following trivial names are retained in the IUPAC system: \n * [[isobutane]] for 2-methylpropane \n * [[isopentane]] for 2-methylbutane \n * [[neopentane]] for 2,2-dimethylpropane. \n \n ;Non-IUPAC \n Some non-IUPAC trivial names are occasionally used: \n * cetane, for [[hexadecane]] \n * cerane, for [[hexacosane]] < ref > Donald Mackay, ''Handbook of Physical-Chemical Properties and Environmental Fate for Organic Chemicals'', {{isbn|1420044397}}, p. 206 < /ref > \n \n ==Physical properties== \n All alkanes are colorless. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://nsdl.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/777/1/Revised+organic+chemistry.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192647/http://nsdl.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/777/1/Revised%2Borganic%2Bchemistry.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 }} < /ref > < ref name= \" s-anand \" > {{cite web|url=http://textbook.s-anand.net/ncert/class-11/chemistry/13-hydrocarbons |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508081631/http://textbook.s-anand.net/ncert/class-11/chemistry/13-hydrocarbons |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 May 2011 |title=13.

As a rule of thumb, the boiling point rises 20\u201330 & nbsp;\u00b0C for each carbon added to the chain; this rule applies to other homologous series. < ref name = m & b/ > \n \n A straight-chain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branched-chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact, thus the greater van der Waals forces, between adjacent molecules. For example, compare [[isobutane]] (2-methylpropane) and [[n-butane]] (butane), which boil at \u221212 and 0 & nbsp;\u00b0C, and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58 & nbsp;\u00b0C, respectively. < ref name = m & b/ >  For the latter case, two molecules 2,3-dimethylbutane can  \" lock \"  into each other better than the cross-shaped 2,2-dimethylbutane, hence the greater van der Waals forces.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} \n \n On the other hand, cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules, which give a plane of intermolecular contact. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Organic_Chemistry/Alkanes/Properties_of_Alkanes/Cycloalkanes/Physical_Properties_of_Cycloalkanes|title=Physical Properties of Cycloalkanes|date=29 November 2015|website=Chemistry LibreTexts|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202012447/https://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Organic_Chemistry/Alkanes/Properties_of_Alkanes/Cycloalkanes/Physical_Properties_of_Cycloalkanes|archive-date=2 February 2018|url-status=dead|access-date=2 February 2018}} < /ref > \n \n ===Melting points=== \n The [[melting point]]s of the alkanes follow a similar trend to [[boiling points]] for the same reason as outlined above. That is, (all other things being equal) the larger the molecule the higher the melting point. There is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points. Solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids. This rigid structure requires energy to break down. Thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart. For alkanes, this can be seen from the graph above (i.e., the blue line). The odd-numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes. This is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase, forming a well-organized structure, which requires more energy to break apart. The odd-numbered alkanes pack less well and so the  \" looser \"  organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart. < ref > {{cite journal |vauthors=Boese R, Weiss HC, Blaser D | title= The melting point alternation in the short-chain ''n''-alkanes: Single-crystal X-ray analyses of propane at 30 & nbsp;K and of ''n''-butane to ''n''-nonane at 90 & nbsp;K | journal= Angew Chem Int Ed | year=1999 | volume=38 | pages=988\u2013992 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(19990401)38:7 < 988::AID-ANIE988 > 3.3.CO;2-S}} < /ref >  For a visualization of the crystal structures see. < ref > [https://log-web.de/chemie/Start.htm?name=methaneCryst & lang=en visualization of crystal structures.] < /ref > \n \n The melting points of branched-chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase: This is particularly true for [[isoalkanes]] (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} \n \n ===Conductivity and solubility=== \n Alkanes do not conduct electricity in any way, nor are they substantially [[Relative static permittivity|polarized]] by an [[electric field]]. For this reason, they do not form [[hydrogen bond]]s and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water. Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule, the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order (a reduction in [[entropy]]). As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water: Alkanes are said to be [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] as they repel water.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} \n \n Their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively high, a property that is called [[lipophilicity]]. Alkanes are, for example, miscible in all proportions among themselves.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} \n \n The density of the alkanes usually increases with the number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water. Hence, alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane\u2013water mixture. < ref > {{Cite book|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128024447000033|title=Alkanes and Cycloalkanes|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-802444-7|language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-802444-7.00003-3}} < /ref > \n \n ===Molecular geometry=== < !-- This section is linked from [[Nylon]] -- > \n [[Image:Ch4 hybridization.svg|thumb|right|sp < sup > 3 < /sup > -hybridization in [[methane]].]] \n The molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics. It is derived from the [[electron configuration]] of [[carbon]], which has four [[valence electron]]s. The carbon atoms in alkanes are always sp < sup > 3 < /sup > -hybridized, that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals. These orbitals, which have identical energies, are arranged spatially in the form of a [[tetrahedron]], the angle of cos < sup > \u22121 < /sup > (\u2212{{sfrac|3}}) & nbsp;\u2248 & nbsp;109.47\u00b0 between them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} \n \n ===Bond lengths and bond angles=== \n An alkane has only C\u2013H and C\u2013C single bonds. The former result from the overlap of an sp < sup > 3 < /sup >  orbital of carbon with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen; the latter by the overlap of two sp < sup > 3 < /sup >  orbitals on adjacent carbon atoms.

Structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another, while both common and useful, do not correspond with the reality.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} \n \n ===Conformation=== \n {{Main|Alkane stereochemistry}} \n {{Unreferenced section|date=January 2021}} \n The structural formula and the [[bond angle]]s are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule. There is a further [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] for each carbon\u2013carbon bond: the [[torsion angle]] between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond. The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its [[conformational isomerism|conformation]]. \n [[Image:Newman projection ethane.png|thumb|right|200px|Newman projections of the two conformations of ethane: eclipsed on the left, staggered on the right.]] \n [[Image:Ethane-rotamers-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Ball-and-stick model]]s of the two rotamers of ethane]] \n \n [[Ethane]] forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes, as there is only one C\u2013C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C\u2013C bond, one will see the so-called [[Newman projection]]. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120\u00b0 between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon\u2013carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: [[eclipsed]] conformation and [[staggered conformation]]. \n \n The two conformations differ in energy: the staggered conformation is 12.6 & nbsp;kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the eclipsed conformation (the least stable). \n \n This difference in energy between the two conformations, known as the [[torsion energy]], is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature. There is constant rotation about the C\u2013C bond. The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next, equivalent to the rotation of one CH < sub > 3 < /sub >  group by 120\u00b0 relative to the other, is of the order of 10 < sup > \u221211 < /sup > & nbsp;seconds. \n \n The case of [[higher alkanes]] is more complex but based on similar principles, with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon\u2013carbon bond. For this reason, alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models. The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms, as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules: Alkane molecules have no fixed structural form, whatever the models may suggest. \n \n ===Spectroscopic properties=== \n {{Unreferenced section|date=January 2021}} \n Virtually all organic compounds contain carbon\u2013carbon, and carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds, and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra. Alkanes are notable for having no other groups, and therefore for the ''absence'' of other characteristic spectroscopic features of a functional group like [[Alcohol (chemistry)|\u2013OH]], [[Aldehyde|\u2013CHO]], [[Carboxylic acid|\u2013COOH]] etc. \n \n ====Infrared spectroscopy==== \n The carbon\u2013hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960 & nbsp;[[Wavenumber|cm < sup > \u22121 < /sup > ]], while the carbon\u2013carbon stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300 & nbsp;cm < sup > \u22121 < /sup > . The carbon\u2013hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group: methyl groups show bands at 1450 & nbsp;cm < sup > \u22121 < /sup >  and 1375 & nbsp;cm < sup > \u22121 < /sup > , while methylene groups show bands at 1465 & nbsp;cm < sup > \u22121 < /sup >  and 1450 & nbsp;cm < sup > \u22121 < /sup > . Carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725 & nbsp;cm < sup > \u22121 < /sup > . \n \n ====NMR spectroscopy==== \n The proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at [[chemical shift|''\u03b4'' < sub > H < /sub > ]] = 0.5\u20131.5. The carbon-13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon: ''\u03b4'' < sub > C < /sub >  = 8\u201330 (primary, methyl, \u2013CH < sub > 3 < /sub > ), 15\u201355 (secondary, methylene, \u2013CH < sub > 2 < /sub > \u2013), 20\u201360 (tertiary, methyne, C\u2013H) and quaternary. The carbon-13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak, due to the lack of [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] and the long [[relaxation time]], and can be missed in weak samples, or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time. \n \n ====Mass spectrometry==== \n Alkanes have a high [[ionization energy]], and the molecular ion is usually weak. The fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret, but, in the case of branched chain alkanes, the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting [[free radical]]s. The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group (''M'' & nbsp;\u2212 & nbsp;15) is often absent, and other fragments are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units, corresponding to sequential loss of CH < sub > 2 < /sub >  groups. \n \n ==Chemical properties== \n \n Alkanes are only weakly reactive with most chemical compounds. The [[acid dissociation constant]] (p''K'' < sub > a < /sub > ) values of all alkanes are estimated to range from 50 to 70, depending on the extrapolation method, hence they are extremely weak acids that are practically inert to bases (see: [[carbon acid]]s). They are also extremely weak bases, undergoing no observable protonation in pure sulfuric acid (''H'' < sub > 0 < /sub >  ~ \u201312), although [[superacid]]s that are at least millions of times stronger have been known to protonate them to give hypercoordinate alkanium ions (see: [[Methanium|methanium ion]]). Similarly, they only show reactivity with the strongest of electrophilic reagents (e.g., [[dioxirane]]s and salts containing the [[Tetrafluoroammonium|NF < sub > 4 < /sub > < sup > + < /sup >  cation]]).  By virtue of their strongly C\u2013H bonds (~100 kcal/mol) and C\u2013C bonds (~90 kcal/mol, but usually less sterically accessible), they are also relatively unreactive toward free radicals, although many electron-deficient radicals will react with alkanes in the absence of other electron-rich bonds (see below). This inertness is the source of the term ''paraffins'' (with the meaning here of  \" lacking affinity \" ). In [[crude oil]] the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} \n \n [[Free radical]]s, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers.  Moreover, redox reactions of alkanes involving free radical intermediates, in particular with oxygen and the halogens, are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced state; in the case of methane, carbon is in its lowest possible oxidation state (\u22124). Reaction with oxygen (''if'' present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction [[stoichiometry]]) leads to combustion without any smoke, producing [[carbon dioxide]] and water. [[Free radical halogenation]] reactions occur with halogens, leading to the production of [[haloalkanes]]. In addition, alkanes have been shown to interact with, and bind to, certain transition metal complexes in [[carbon-hydrogen bond activation|C\u2013H bond activation]] reactions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} \n \n In highly branched alkanes, the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value (109.5\u00b0) to accommodate bulky groups. Such distortions introduce a tension in the molecule, known as [[steric hindrance]] or strain.  Strain substantially increases reactivity. \n \n However, in general and perhaps surprisingly, when branching is not extensive enough to make highly disfavorable 1,2- and 1,3-alkyl\u2013alkyl steric interactions (worth ~3.1 kcal/mol and ~3.7 kcal/mol in the case of the eclipsing conformations of butane and pentane, respectively) unavoidable, the branched alkanes are actually more thermodynamically stable than their linear (or less branched) isomers.  For example, the highly branched 2,2,3,3-tetramethylbutane is about 1.9 kcal/mol more stable than its linear isomer, ''n''-octane. < ref name= \" :4 \" > {{Cite book|title=Stereoelectronic effects : a bridge between structure and reactivity|last=Alabugin, Igor V.

The hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms. [[Free radical]]s are the reactive species that participate in the reaction, which usually leads to a mixture of products. The reaction is highly [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] with halogen fluorine and can lead to an explosion. < ref > {{Cite web|date=2013-10-03|title=Halogenation Alkanes|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_(Organic_Chemistry)/Alkanes/Reactivity_of_Alkanes/Halogenation_Alkanes|access-date=2021-05-25|website=Chemistry LibreTexts|language=en}} < /ref > \n \n These reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons. There are three steps: \n * '''Initiation''' the halogen radicals form by [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolysis]]. Usually, energy in the form of heat or light is required. \n * '''Chain reaction''' or '''Propagation''' then takes place\u2014the halogen radical abstracts a hydrogen from the alkane to give an alkyl radical. This reacts further. \n * '''Chain termination''' where the radicals recombine. \n \n Experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers, indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction. The mixture produced, however, is not a statistical mixture: Secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary free-radicals. An example can be seen in the monobromination of propane: < ref name = m & b/ > \n [[Image:Monobromination of propane.png|500px|center|Monobromination of [[propane]]]] \n \n === Cracking === \n {{Main|Cracking (chemistry)}} \n Cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones. This can be done with a thermal or catalytic method. The thermal cracking process follows a [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] mechanism with formation of [[free-radical]]s. The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of [[acid]] [[catalyst]]s (usually solid acids such as [[silica-alumina]] and [[zeolite]]s), which promote a [[heterolytic cleavage|heterolytic]] (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges, usually a [[carbocation]] and the very unstable [[hydride]] [[anion]]. Carbon-localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C\u2013C scission in position [[beta scission|beta]] (i.e., cracking) and [[Intramolecular reaction|intra-]] and [[intermolecular]] hydrogen transfer or [[hydride]] transfer. In both types of processes, the corresponding [[reactive intermediate]]s (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a self-propagating chain mechanism. The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} \n \n === Isomerization and reformation === \n Dragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes. < ref name= \" Asinger, Friedrich 1967 \" > {{cite book | author = Asinger, Friedrich | title = Paraffins; Chemistry and Technology | url = https://archive.org/details/paraffinschemist0000asin | url-access = registration | location = Oxford| publisher = Pergamon Press | date = 1967}} < /ref >  Isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight-chain alkanes are heated in the presence of a [[platinum]] catalyst.

These hydrocarbons were formed when marine animals and plants (zooplankton and phytoplankton) died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an [[wikt:anoxic|anoxic]] environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form. Natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction: \n :C < sub > 6 < /sub > H < sub > 12 < /sub > O < sub > 6 < /sub >  \u2192 3 & nbsp;CH < sub > 4 < /sub >  + 3 & nbsp;CO < sub > 2 < /sub > \n \n These hydrocarbon deposits, collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks, comprise commercial [[oil fields]]. They have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced. The depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the [[energy crisis]]. \n \n Methane is also present in what is called [[biogas]], produced by animals and decaying matter, which is a possible [[renewable energy source]]. \n \n Alkanes have a low solubility in water, so the content in the oceans is negligible; however, at high pressures and low temperatures (such as at the bottom of the oceans), methane can co-crystallize with water to form a solid [[methane clathrate]] (methane hydrate). Although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time, the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together. Methane extracted from methane clathrate is, therefore, a candidate for future fuels. \n \n ===Biological occurrence=== \n Acyclic alkanes occur in nature in various ways. \n \n ;Bacteria and archaea \n [[Image:Rotbuntes Rind.jpg|thumb|right|[[Methanogen]]ic [[archaea]] in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the [[methane]] in Earth's atmosphere.]] \n Certain types of bacteria can metabolize alkanes: they prefer even-numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-numbered chains. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/static/classic_rxns/classic_reactions/fatty_acid_met.html|title=Metabolism of Alkanes and Fatty Acids \u2013 eQuilibrator 0.2 beta documentation|website=equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il|language=en|access-date=11 April 2018}} < /ref > \n \n On the other hand, certain [[archaea]], the [[methanogen]]s, produce large quantities of [[methane]] by the metabolism of [[carbon dioxide]] or other [[oxidation|oxidized]] organic compounds.

Sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate; in the case of ''A. nigroaenea'', the females emit a mixture of [[tricosane]] (C < sub > 23 < /sub > H < sub > 48 < /sub > ), [[pentacosane]] (C < sub > 25 < /sub > H < sub > 52 < /sub > ) and [[heptacosane]] (C < sub > 27 < /sub > H < sub > 56 < /sub > ) in the ratio 3:3:1, and males are attracted by specifically this odor. The orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen; parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees. As a result, numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner: although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee, it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen, \n which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to other blooms. \n \n ==Production== \n {{More citations needed section|date=January 2021}} \n \n ===Petroleum refining=== \n [[Image:ShellMartinez-refi.jpg|thumb|right|An [[oil refinery]] at [[Martinez, California]].]] \n As stated earlier, the most important source of alkanes is natural gas and [[crude oil]]. < ref name=m & b/ >  Alkanes are separated in an [[oil refinery]] by [[fractional distillation]] and processed into many products. \n \n ===Fischer\u2013Tropsch=== \n The [[Fischer\u2013Tropsch process]] is a method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons, including alkanes, from [[carbon monoxide]] and hydrogen. This method is used to produce substitutes for [[petroleum distillate]]s. \n \n ===Laboratory preparation=== \n There is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory, since they are usually commercially available. Also, alkanes are generally unreactive chemically or biologically, and do not undergo [[functional group interconversion]]s cleanly. When alkanes are produced in the laboratory, it is often a side-product of a reaction. For example, the use of [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] as a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]] gives the conjugate acid, ''n''-butane as a side-product: \n \n : C < sub > 4 < /sub > H < sub > 9 < /sub > Li + H < sub > 2 < /sub > O \u2192 C < sub > 4 < /sub > H < sub > 10 < /sub >  + [[lithium hydroxide|LiOH]] \n \n However, at times it may be desirable to make a section of a molecule into an alkane-like functionality ([[alkyl]] group) using the above or similar methods. For example, an [[ethyl group]] is an alkyl group; when this is attached to a [[Hydroxyl|hydroxy]] group, it gives [[ethanol]], which is not an alkane. To do so, the best-known methods are [[hydrogenation]] of [[alkene]]s: \n \n :RCH=CH < sub > 2 < /sub >  + H < sub > 2 < /sub >  \u2192 RCH < sub > 2 < /sub > CH < sub > 3 < /sub > {{spaces|5}}(R = [[alkyl]]) \n \n Alkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from [[alkyl halide]]s in the [[Corey\u2013House synthesis|Corey\u2013House\u2013Posner\u2013Whitesides reaction]].

In this reaction powdered catalyst is preferred to increase the surface area so that adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst increases. In this reaction the hydrogen gets attached on the catalyst to form a hydrogen-catalyst bond which leads to weakening of H-H bond, thereby leading to the addition of hydrogen on alkenes and alkynes. The reaction is exothermic because the product alkane is stable as it has more sigma bonds than the reactant alkenes and alkynes due to conversion of pi bond to sigma bonds. < ref > Harikiran.B, K E Mannanam, Kottayam < /ref > \n \n ===From haloalkanes=== \n \n Alkanes can be produced from haloalkanes using different methods. \n \n ====Wurtz reaction==== \n \n When haloalkane is treated with sodium in dry ether, alkane with double the number of carbon atoms is obtained. This reaction proceeds through free radical intermediate and has possibility of alkene formation in case of tertiary haloalkanes and vicinal dihalides. \n \n ====Corey-House-Synthesis==== \n \n When haloalkane is treated with dialkyl lithium cuprite, which is otherwise known as Gilman's reagent, any higher alkane is obtained. \n \n ====Reaction with metal hydride==== \n \n When haloalkanes are treated with metal hydride, e.g., sodium hydride and lithium aluminium hydride. \n \n ====Frankland reaction==== \n \n When haloalkane is treated with zinc in ester, alkane is obtained. \n \n ====Fittig reaction==== \n \n When aryl halide is treated with sodium in dry ether, it forms biphenyl. \n \n ====Ullmann biaryl synthesis==== \n \n When aryl halide is treated with copper, it forms biphenyl. \n \n ====Wurtz-Fittig reaction==== \n \n When aryl halide is treated with haloalkane, we get alkyl benzene. \n \n ==Applications== \n The applications of alkanes depend on the number of carbon atoms. The first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes, and in some countries for electricity generation. [[Methane]] and [[ethane]] are the main components of natural gas; they are normally stored as gases under pressure. It is, however, easier to transport them as liquids: This requires both compression and cooling of the gas. \n \n [[Propane]] and [[butane]] are gases at atmospheric pressure that can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are commonly known as [[liquified petroleum gas]] (LPG). Propane is used in propane gas burners and as a fuel for road vehicles, < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://www.ferrellgas.com/Resource_/PageResource/LA_Transit_Case_Study.pdf |title=Using propane as a fuel |access-date=27 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012000108/http://ferrellgas.com/Resource_/PageResource/LA_Transit_Case_Study.pdf |archive-date=12 October 2013 |url-status=dead  }} < /ref >  butane in space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters. Both are used as propellants in [[aerosol spray]]s. \n \n From [[pentane]] to [[octane]] the alkanes are highly volatile liquids. They are used as fuels in [[internal combustion engine]]s, as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes [[Engine knocking|knocking]], than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition is measured by the [[octane rating]] of the fuel, where [[2,2,4-Trimethylpentane|2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (''isooctane'') has an arbitrary value of 100, and [[heptane]] has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good [[solvent]]s for nonpolar substances. \n \n Alkanes from [[nonane]] to, for instance, [[hexadecane]] (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids of higher [[viscosity]], less and less suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[aviation fuel]]. Diesel fuels are characterized by their [[cetane number]], cetane being an old name for hexadecane. However, the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly. \n \n Alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of [[fuel oil]] and [[lubricating oil]]. In the latter function, they work at the same time as anti-corrosive agents, as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface. Many solid alkanes find use as [[paraffin wax]], for example, in [[candle]]s. This should not be confused however with true [[wax]], which consists primarily of [[ester]]s. \n \n Alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in [[bitumen]], used, for example, in road surfacing. However, the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]]. \n \n Some synthetic [[polymer]]s such as [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]] are alkanes with chains containing hundreds or thousands of carbon atoms. These materials are used in innumerable applications, and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year. \n \n ==Environmental transformations== \n {{expand section|date=August 2014}} \n Alkanes are chemically very inert apolar molecules which are not very reactive as organic compounds.  This inertness yields serious ecological issues if they are released into the environment. Due to their lack of functional groups and low water solubility, alkanes show poor bioavailability for microorganisms. < ref > {{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226738847|title=Microbial Degradation of Xenobiotics|pages=439\u2013469|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-23789-8_17|chapter=Microbial Degradation of Alkanes|year=2012|last1=Singh|first1=S.
