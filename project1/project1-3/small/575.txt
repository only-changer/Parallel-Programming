  "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2021}} \n {{short description|13th-century friar and diplomat}} \n '''Andr\u00e9 de Longjumeau''' (also known as '''Andrew of Longjumeau''' in English) was a 13th-century [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] missionary and diplomat and one of the most active Occidental diplomats in the East in the 13th century. He led two embassies to the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]: the first carried letters from [[Pope Innocent IV]] and the second bore gifts and letters from [[Louis IX of France]] to [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan]]. Well acquainted with the [[Middle-East]], he spoke [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and  \" [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldean]] \"  (thought to be either [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or [[Persian language|Persian]]). < ref name =  \" mxpvnk \" > {{harvnb|Roux|1985|p=96}} < /ref > \n \n ==Mission for the holy Crown of Thorns== \n [[Image:HolyCrown.JPG|thumb|Andr\u00e9 went to Constantinople to obtain the [[Crown of Thorns]] bought by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] from [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]]. It is preserved today in a 19th-century reliquary, in [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]], [[Paris]].]] \n Andr\u00e9's first mission to the East was when he was asked by the French king [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] to go to [[Constantinople]] to obtain the [[Crown of Thorns]] which had been sold to him by the [[Latin Emperor]] [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]] in 1238, who was anxious to obtain support for his empire. < ref name =  \" mxpvnk \" / >  Andr\u00e9 was accompanied on this mission by a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]], brother Jacques. \n \n ==Papal mission to the Mongols (1245\u20131247)== \n Andr\u00e9 of Longjumeau led one of four missions dispatched to the Mongols by [[Pope Innocent IV]]. He left [[Lyon]] in the spring of 1245 for the [[Levant]]. < ref > Gregory G. Guzman,  \" Simon of Saint-Quentin and the Dominican Mission to the Mongol Baiju: A Reappraisal \"  ''Speculum'', Vol. 46, No. 2. (April., 1971), p. 235. < /ref >   \n He visited Muslim principalities in [[Syria]] and representatives of the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] churches in Persia, finally delivering the papal correspondence to a Mongol general near [[Tabriz]]. < ref > [[Igor de Rachewiltz]], ''Papal Envoys to the Great Khans'' (Stanford University Press, 1971), p. 113. < /ref >  In Tabriz, Andr\u00e9 de Longjumeau met with a monk from the [[Far East]], named [[Simeon Rabban Ata]], who had been put in charge by the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of protecting the Christians in the [[Middle-East]].{{sfn|Richard|p=376}} \n \n ==Second mission to the Mongols (1249\u20131251)== \n {{further information|Franco-Mongol alliance|Europeans in Medieval China|}} \n At the Mongol camp near [[Kars]], Andr\u00e9 had met a certain [[David and Mark|David]], who in December 1248 appeared at the court of King [[Louis IX of France]] in [[Cyprus]]. Andr\u00e9, who was now with the French King, interpreted David's, a real or pretended offer of alliance from the Mongol general [[Eljigidei]], and a proposal of a joint attack upon the Islamic powers of [[Syria]]. In reply to this the French sovereign dispatched Andr\u00e9 as his ambassador to [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan]]. Longjumeau went with his brother Jacques (also a Dominican) and several others \u2013 John Goderiche, John of Carcassonne, Herbert  \" Le [[Sommelier]] \" , Gerbert of Sens, Robert (a clerk), a certain William, and an unnamed clerk of [[Poissy]].{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=972}} \n \n The party set out on 16 February 1249, with letters from King Louis and the [[papal legate]], and rich presents, including a chapel-tent lined with scarlet cloth and embroidered with sacred pictures. From Cyprus they went to the port of [[Antioch]] in Syria, and thence traveled for a year to the Khan's court, going ten leagues (55.56 kilometers) per day. Their route led them through [[Iran|Persia]], along the southern and eastern shores of the [[Caspian Sea]], and certainly through [[Taraz|Talas]], north-east of [[Tashkent]].{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=972}} \n \n On arrival at the supreme Mongol court \u2013 either that on the [[Emil River|Imyl river]] (near [[Lake Alakol]] and the present Russo-Chinese frontier in the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]]), or more probably at or near [[Karakorum]] itself, south-west of [[Lake Baikal]] \u2013 Andr\u00e9 found G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan dead, poisoned, as the envoy supposed, by [[Batu Khan]]'s agents. The regent-mother [[Oghul Qaimish]] (the  \" Camus \"  of [[William of Rubruck]]) seems to have received and dismissed him with presents and a dismissive letter for Louis IX. But it is certain that before the friar had left  \" Tartary \" , [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]], G\u00fcy\u00fck's successor, had been elected.{{sfn|Beazley|1911|pp=972\u2013973}} \n \n Andr\u00e9's report to his sovereign, whom he rejoined in 1251 at [[Caesarea Palaestina|Caesarea]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], appears to have been a mixture of history and fable; the latter affects his narrative of the Mongols' rise to greatness, and the struggles of their leader [[Genghis Khan]] with the mythical [[Prester John]], and in the supposed location of the [[Mongols]]' homeland, close to the prison of [[Gog and Magog]]. On the other hand, the envoy's account of Mongol customs is fairly accurate, and his statements about [[Christianity among the Mongols|Mongol Christianity]] and its prosperity, though perhaps exaggerated (e.g. as to the 800 chapels on wheels in the nomadic host) are likely factual.{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=973}} \n \n Mounds of bones marked his road, witnesses of devastations which other historians record in detail. He found Christian prisoners from Germany in the heart of  \" Tartary \"  (at Talas), and was compelled to observe the ceremony of passing between two fires, as a bringer of gifts to a dead [[Genghis Khan|Khan]], gifts which were treated by the Mongols as evidence of submission. This insulting behaviour, and the language of the letter with which Andr\u00e9 reappeared, marked the mission a failure: King Louis, says [[Jean de Joinville|Joinville]],  \" ''se repenti fort'' \"  ( \" felt very sorry \" ).{{sfn|Beazley|1911|p=973}} \n \n ==Death== \n The date and location of Andr\u00e9's death is unknown. < ref name= \" Dorcy1990 \" > {{cite book|last=Dorcy|first=Sr. Mary Jean|title=St. Dominic's Family: Over 300 Famous Dominicans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iL-cCwAAQBAJ & pg=PT62|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=24 November 1990|publisher=TAN Books|isbn=9781505103465|page=62}} < /ref > \n \n We only know of Andr\u00e9 through references in other writers: see especially [[William of Rubruck]]'s in ''Recueil de voyages'', iv.
