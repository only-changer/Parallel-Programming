As bishop, he took a firm position against [[Arianism]] and attempted to mediate the conflict between the emperor [[Theodosius I]] and the usurper [[Magnus Maximus]]. Tradition credits Ambrose with promoting  \" [[Ambrosian chant|antiphonal chant]] \" , a style of chanting in which one side of the choir responds alternately to the other, as well as with composing ''[[Veni redemptor gentium]]'', an [[Advent]] hymn. He also had notable influence on [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430). \n \n [[Western Christianity]] identified Ambrose as one of its four traditional [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]]. He is considered a [[saint]] by the [[Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Anglican Communion]], and various [[Lutheran|Lutheran denominations]], and venerated as the [[patron saint]] of Milan. \n \n == Life == \n \n === Early life === \n Ambrose was born into a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Christians|Christian]] family about 339 and was raised in the Roman providence of [[Gallia Belgica]], the capital of which was [[Trier|Augusta Treverorum]].{{sfn|Loughlin|1907}} His father is sometimes identified with Aurelius Ambrosius,{{sfn|Greenslade|1956|p=175}}{{Sfn | Paredi | Costelloe | 1964 | p = 380 | ps = :  \" S. Paulinus in ''Vit. Ambr. 3'' has the following: ''posito in administratione prefecture Galliarum patre eius Ambrosio natus est Ambrosius''.

This is the only evidence we have, however, that there ever was an Ambrose as prefect in Gaul. \" }} a [[Praetorian prefecture of Gaul|praetorian prefect of Gaul]];{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}} but some scholars identify his father as an official named Uranius who received an imperial constitution dated 3 February 339 (addressed in a brief extract from one of the three emperors ruling in 339, [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], [[Constantius II]], or [[Constans]], in the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'', book XI.5).{{sfn|Barnes|2011|pp=45\u201346}} < ref > Mazzarino, S.  \" Il padre di Ambrogio \" , Helikon 13\u201314, 1973\u20131974, 111\u2013117. < /ref > < ref > Mazzarino, S.,  \" Storia sociale del vescovo Ambrogio \" , Problemi e ricerche di storia antica 4, Rome 1989, 79\u201381. < /ref > \n \n His mother was a woman of intellect and piety{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=798}} and a member of the Roman family ''Aurelii Symmachi,''{{sfn|Barnes|2011|p=50}} and thus Ambrose was cousin of the orator [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]]. He was the youngest of three children, who included [[Saint Marcellina|Marcellina]] and [[Satyrus of Milan|Satyrus]] (who is the subject of Ambrose's ''De excessu fratris Satyri''), also venerated as saints. < ref > {{Citation | url = http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90298 | title = Santi Beati | place = Italy | language = it}} < /ref >  There is a legend that as an infant, a swarm of [[bee]]s settled on his face while he lay in his cradle, leaving behind a drop of honey. His father considered this a [[Christian symbolism|sign]] of his future eloquence and honeyed tongue. For this reason, bees and [[beehive]]s often appear in the [[saint symbolism|saint's symbology]]. \n \n About the year 354 Ambrosius, the father, died, whereupon the family moved to Rome. < ref > [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01383c.htm Loughlin, James.  \" St. Ambrose. \"  The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 1.

He then followed in his father's footsteps and entered public service. [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy|Praetorian Prefect]] [[Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus]] first gave him a place in the council and then in about 372 made him governor of Liguria and Emilia, with headquarters at Milan.{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}} In 286 Diocletian had moved the capital of the Western Roman Empire from Rome to Mediolanum (Milan). \n \n Ambrose was the Governor of Aemilia-Liguria in northern Italy until 374, when he became the Bishop of Milan. Ambrose was a very popular political figure, and since he had been the Governor in the effective capital in the Roman West, he was a recognizable figure in the court of [[Valentinian I]]. \n \n === Bishop of Milan === \n In the late 4th century there was a deep conflict in the [[diocese of Milan]] between the [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene Church]] and [[Arianism|Arians]].{{sfn|Wilken|2003|p=218}}{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 407}} In 374 [[Auxentius of Milan|the bishop of Milan, Auxentius]], an Arian, died, and the Arians challenged the [[Apostolic succession|succession]]. Ambrose went to the church where the election was to take place, to prevent an uproar, which was probable in this crisis. His address was interrupted by a call,  \" Ambrose, bishop! \" , which was taken up by the whole assembly.{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 407}} \n \n Ambrose was known to be Nicene Christian in belief, but also acceptable to Arians due to the charity shown in theological matters in this regard. At first he energetically refused the office, for which he was in no way prepared: Ambrose was neither baptized nor formally trained in [[theology]].{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}} Upon his appointment, Ambrose fled to a colleague's home seeking to hide. Upon receiving a letter from the Emperor [[Gratianus|Gratian]] praising the appropriateness of Rome appointing individuals evidently worthy of holy positions, Ambrose's host gave him up. Within a week, he was baptized, ordained and duly consecrated bishop of [[Milan]]. \n \n As bishop, he immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle, apportioned his money to the poor, donating all of his land, making only provision for his sister [[Saint Marcellina|Marcellina]] (who had become a nun). This raised his popularity even further, giving him considerable political leverage over even the emperor. Upon the unexpected appointment of Ambrose to the episcopate, his brother Satyrus resigned a prefecture in order to move to Milan, where he took over managing the diocese's temporal affairs.{{sfn|Loughlin|1907}} \n \n In 383 Gratian was assassinated at [[Lyon]], France, and [[Paulinus of Nola]], who had served as governor of Campania, went to Milan to attend the school of Ambrose. < ref name=Benedict > [http://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20071212.html Pope Benedict XVI.  \" St. Paulinus of Nola \" , ''L'Osservatore Romano'', December 19, 2007, p. 15] < /ref > \n \n === Arianism === \n [[File:Museo del Duomo - Milan - St Ambrose of Milan - Unknown Lombard author (early 17 century).jpg|thumb|200px|Statue of Saint Ambrose with a scourge in Museo del Duomo, Milan. Unknown Lombard author, early 17 century.]] \n \n Ambrose studied theology with [[Simplician]], a [[presbyter]] of Rome.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=798}} Using to his advantage his excellent knowledge of Greek, which was then rare in the West, he studied the Old Testament and Greek authors like [[Philo]], [[Origen]], [[Athanasius]], and [[Basil of Caesarea]], with whom he was also exchanging letters. < ref > {{Citation | editor-last = Schaff | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.ix.cxcviii.html | title = Letter of Basil to Ambrose | publisher = Christian Classics Ethereal library | access-date = 2012-12-08}} < /ref >  He applied this knowledge as preacher, concentrating especially on exegesis of the Old Testament, and his rhetorical abilities impressed [[Augustine of Hippo]], who hitherto had thought poorly of Christian preachers. \n \n In the confrontation with Arians, Ambrose sought to theologically refute their propositions, which were contrary to the [[Nicene creed]] and thus to the officially defined orthodoxy. The Arians appealed to many high level leaders and clergy in both the Western and Eastern empires. Although the western Emperor [[Gratian]] supported orthodoxy, the younger [[Valentinian II]], who became his colleague in the Empire, adhered to the Arian creed.{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} Ambrose did not sway the young prince's position. In the East, Emperor [[Theodosius I]] likewise professed the Nicene creed; but there were many adherents of Arianism throughout his dominions,{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=798}} especially among the higher clergy. \n \n In this contested state of religious opinion, two leaders of the Arians, bishops [[Palladius of Ratiaria]] and Secundianus of [[Singidunum]], confident of numbers, prevailed upon Gratian to call a general council from all parts of the empire. This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation. However, Ambrose feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the Western bishops. Accordingly, a [[Council of Aquileia, 381|synod]] composed of thirty-two bishops was held at [[Aquileia]] in the year 381. Ambrose was elected president and Palladius, being called upon to defend his opinions, declined. A vote was then taken and Palladius and his associate Secundianus were deposed from their episcopal offices.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=798}} \n \n Nevertheless, the increasing strength of the Arians proved a formidable task for Ambrose. In 385{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} or 386 the emperor and his mother [[Justina (empress)|Justina]], along with a considerable number of [[clergy]] and [[laity]], especially military, professed Arianism. They demanded two churches in [[Milan]], one in the city (the [[Basilica]] of the Apostles), the other in the suburbs (St Victor's), be allocated to the Arians.{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} Ambrose refused and was required to answer for his conduct before the council.{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}} He went, his eloquence in defense of the Church reportedly overawing the ministers of Valentinian, so he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches. The day following, when he was performing [[Liturgy of the Hours|divine service]] in the basilica, the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian basilica in the suburbs. As he still refused, certain deans or officers of the court were sent to take possession of the Portian basilica, by hanging up in it imperial escutcheons{{sfn|Butler|1991|p=408}} to prepare for the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of [[Easter]].{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}} \n \n In spite of Imperial opposition, Ambrose declared,  \" If you demand my person, I am ready to submit: carry me to prison or to death, I will not resist; but I will never betray the church of Christ. I will not call upon the people to succour me; I will die at the foot of the altar rather than desert it. The tumult of the people I will not encourage: but God alone can appease it. \" {{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}} \n \n In 386 Justina and Valentinian received the Arian bishop [[Auxentius of Durostorum|Auxentius the younger]], and Ambrose was again ordered to hand over a church in Milan for Arian usage. Ambrose and his congregation barricaded themselves inside the church, and the imperial order was rescinded. < ref > {{Citation | title = The Cambridge Ancient History | page = 106}} < /ref > \n \n === Imperial relations === \n [[Image:Anthonis van Dyck 005.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Ambrose barring Theodosius from Milan Cathedral]]'' by [[Anthony van Dyck]]. [[National Gallery, London]].]] \n The imperial court was displeased with the religious principles of Ambrose, though his aid was soon solicited by the Emperor. When [[Magnus Maximus]] usurped the supreme power in [[Gaul]], and was meditating a descent upon Italy, Valentinian sent Ambrose to dissuade him from the undertaking, and the embassy was successful.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}} \n \n A second later embassy was unsuccessful. The enemy entered [[Italy]] and [[Milan]] was taken. Justina and her son fled but Ambrose remained at his post and did good service to many of the sufferers by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}} \n \n [[Theodosius I]], the emperor of the East, espoused the cause of Justina, and regained the kingdom. Theodosius was [[Excommunication#Roman Catholic Church|excommunicated]] by Ambrose for the [[Massacre of Thessaloniki|massacre]] of 7,000 people at [[Thessalonika|Thessalonica]] in 390,{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}} after the murder of the Roman governor there by rioters.{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}} Ambrose told Theodosius to imitate [[David (biblical king)|David]] in his repentance as he had imitated him in guilt,{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}} and he readmitted the emperor to the Eucharist only after several months of penance. This shows the strong position of a bishop in the western part of the empire, even when facing a strong emperor. The controversy of [[John Chrysostom]] with a much weaker emperor a few years later in Constantinople led to a crushing defeat of the bishop. \n \n In 392, after the death of [[Valentinian II]] and the fall of [[Eugenius]], Ambrose supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported Eugenius after Theodosius was eventually victorious.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}} \n \n [[File:AmbroseGiuLungara.jpg|thumb|alt=painting of St. Ambrose|Saint Ambrose with [[scourge]] and book, a painting in the church of San Giuseppe alla Lungara, Rome]] \n \n === Attitude towards Jews === \n In his treatise on [[Abraham]], Ambrose warns against intermarriage with pagans, Jews, or heretics. < ref > [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/03d/0339-0397,_Ambrosius,_De_Abraham_Libri_Duo,_LT.pdf ''De Abraham'', ix. 84, xiv. 451] < /ref >  In 388, Emperor [[Theodosius the Great]] was informed that a crowd of Christians, led by their bishop, had destroyed the [[synagogue]] at Callinicum on the [[Euphrates]].

For thus we read, where the Lord our God speaks by the mouth of the prophet [[Jeremiah]]: 'And I will do to this house, which is called by My Name, wherein ye trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh, and I will cast you forth from My sight, as I cast forth your brethren, the whole seed of Ephraim.

The chief causes of his victory over his opponents were his great popularity and the reverence paid to the episcopal character at that period. He used several indirect means to obtain and support his authority with the people.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}} \n \n It was his custom to comment severely in his preaching on the public characters of his times; and he introduced popular reforms in the order and manner of public worship. It is alleged, too, that at a time when the influence of Ambrose required vigorous support, he was admonished in a dream to search for, and found under the pavement of the church, the remains of two [[martyr]]s, Gervasius and Protasius. The saints, although they would have had to have been hundreds of years old, looked as if they had just died. The applause of the people was mingled with the derision of the court party.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}} \n \n == Theology == \n Ambrose joins [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Jerome]], and [[Gregory the Great]] as one of the [[Latin]] [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]]. Theologians compare him with [[Hilary of Poitiers|Hilary]], who they claim fell short of Ambrose's administrative excellence but demonstrated greater [[theology|theological]] ability. He succeeded as a theologian despite his juridical training and his comparatively late handling of [[Biblical]] and [[doctrinal]] subjects.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}} \n \n Ambrose's intense episcopal consciousness furthered the growing [[doctrine]] of the Church and its [[sacerdotal]] ministry, while the prevalent [[asceticism]] of the day, continuing the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Cicero]]nian training of his youth, enabled him to promulgate a lofty standard of Christian [[ethics]]. Thus we have the ''De officiis ministrorum'', ''De viduis'', ''De virginitate'' and ''De paenitentia''.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}} \n \n Ambrose displayed a kind of liturgical flexibility that kept in mind that liturgy was a tool to serve people in worshiping God, and ought not to become a rigid entity that is invariable from place to place. His advice to Augustine of Hippo on this point was to follow local liturgical custom.  \" When I am at Rome, I fast on a Saturday; when I am at Milan, I do not.

(The later pope [[Gregory I the Great]] is not known to have composed any [[Gregorian chant]], the [[plainsong]] or  \" [[Romish chant]] \" .) However, Ambrosian chant was named in his honor due to his contributions to the music of the Church; he is credited with introducing [[hymnody]] from the Eastern Church into the West. \n \n Catching the impulse from [[Hilary of Arles]] and confirmed in it by the success of Arian [[psalmody]], Ambrose composed several original [[hymn]]s as well, four of which still survive, along with music which may not have changed too much from the original melodies. Each of these hymns has eight, four-line [[stanza]]s and is written in strict iambic tetrameter (that is 4 & nbsp;\u00d7 & nbsp;2 syllables, each iamb being two syllables). Marked by dignified simplicity, they served as a fruitful model for later times.{{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}} \n * ''Deus Creator Omnium'' \n * ''Aeterne rerum conditor'' \n * ''Jam surgit hora tertia'' \n * ''Jam Christus astra ascenderat'' \n * ''[[Veni redemptor gentium]]'' (a [[Christmas]] hymn){{sfn|Grieve|1911|p=799}} \n \n In his writings, Ambrose refers only to the performance of [[psalms]], in which solo singing of psalm verses alternated with a congregational refrain called an ''[[antiphon]]''. \n \n Saint Ambrose was also traditionally credited with composing the hymn  \" [[Te Deum]] \" , which he is said to have composed when he baptised [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine of Hippo]], his celebrated convert. \n \n == Augustine == \n Ambrose was Bishop of Milan at the time of Augustine's conversion, and is mentioned in [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]''. It is commonly understood in the Christian Tradition that Ambrose baptized Augustine. \n \n In a passage of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' in which Augustine wonders why he could not share his burden with Ambrose, he comments:  \" Ambrose himself I esteemed a happy man, as the world counted happiness, because great personages held him in honor. Only his celibacy appeared to me a painful burden. \" < ref name= \" AugustineOnAmbrose \" > Augustine. ''Confessions'' Book Six, Chapter Three. < /ref > \n \n === Reading === \n In this same passage of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' is an anecdote which bears on the history of reading: \n {{quote |When [Ambrose] read, his eyes scanned the page and his heart sought out the meaning, but his voice was silent and his tongue was still. Anyone could approach him freely and guests were not commonly announced, so that often, when we came to visit him, we found him reading like this in silence, for he never read aloud. < ref name= \" AugustineOnAmbrose \"  / > }} \n \n This is a celebrated passage in modern scholarly discussion. The practice of reading to oneself without vocalizing the text was less common in antiquity than it has since become. In a culture that set a high value on oratory and public performances of all kinds, in which the production of books was very labor-intensive, the majority of the population was illiterate, and where those with the leisure to enjoy literary works also had slaves to read for them, written texts were more likely to be seen as scripts for recitation than as vehicles of silent reflection. However, there is also evidence that silent reading did occur in antiquity and that it was not generally regarded as unusual. < ref > {{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview27 | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Read my lips | first=James | last=Fenton | date=28 July 2006}} < /ref > < ref > {{Citation | first = AK | last = Gavrilov | title = Techniques of Reading in Classical Antiquity | journal = Classical Quarterly | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | year = 1997 | pages = 56\u201373, esp. 70\u201371 | doi=10.1093/cq/47.1.56| jstor = 639597 }} < /ref > < ref > {{Citation | first = MF | last = Burnyeat | title = Postscript on silent reading | journal = Classical Quarterly | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | year = 1997 | pages = 74\u201376 | doi=10.1093/cq/47.1.74| jstor = 639598 }} < /ref > \n \n ==Bibliography== \n '''Latin''' \n * ''Hexameron, De paradiso, De Cain, De Noe, De Abraham, De Isaac, De bono mortis'' & nbsp;\u2013 ed.
