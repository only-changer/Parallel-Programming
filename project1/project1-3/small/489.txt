[[Properties of water|water]] 40.65 & nbsp;kJ/mol, methane 8.19 & nbsp;kJ/mol, [[phosphine]] 14.6 & nbsp;kJ/mol) and can therefore be used in laboratories in uninsulated vessels without additional refrigeration. See [[#Liquid ammonia as a solvent|liquid ammonia as a solvent]]. \n ;Solvent properties: Ammonia readily [[solubility|dissolves]] in water. In an aqueous solution, it can be expelled by boiling. The [[water|aqueous]] solution of ammonia is [[Base (chemistry)|basic]]. The maximum concentration of ammonia in water (a [[saturated solution]]) has a [[density]] of 0.880 g/cm < sup > 3 < /sup >  and is often known as '.880 ammonia'.  \n ;Combustion: Ammonia does not burn readily or sustain [[combustion]], except under narrow fuel-to-air mixtures of 15\u201325% air. When mixed with [[oxygen]], it burns with a pale yellowish-green flame. Ignition occurs when [[chlorine]] is passed into ammonia, forming nitrogen and [[hydrogen chloride]]; if chlorine is present in excess, then the highly explosive [[nitrogen trichloride]] (NCl < sub > 3 < /sub > ) is also formed. \n ;Decomposition: At high temperature and in the presence of a suitable catalyst, ammonia is decomposed into its constituent elements. Decomposition of ammonia is a slightly endothermic process requiring 23 kJ/mol (5.5 kcal/mol) of ammonia, and yields [[hydrogen]] and [[nitrogen]] gas. Ammonia can also be used as a source of hydrogen for acid [[fuel cell]]s if the unreacted ammonia can be removed. [[Ruthenium]] and [[platinum]] [[catalysts]] were found to be the most active, whereas supported [[Nickel|Ni]] catalysts were the less active. \n \n ===Structure=== \n The ammonia molecule has a [[Trigonal pyramid (chemistry)|trigonal pyramidal]] shape as predicted by the [[valence shell electron pair repulsion theory]] (VSEPR theory) with an experimentally determined bond angle of 106.7\u00b0. < ref name= \" CRC 94th \" > {{cite book | editor= Haynes, William M. | year = 2013 | title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics | edition = 94th | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | isbn = 9781466571143|pages=9\u201326| title-link = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics }} < /ref >  The central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom.

Three of these [[electron pair]]s are used as bond pairs, which leaves one [[lone pair]] of electrons. The lone pair repels more strongly than bond pairs, therefore the bond angle is not 109.5\u00b0, as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement, but 106.7\u00b0. < ref name= \" CRC 94th \" / >  This shape gives the molecule a [[dipole]] moment and makes it [[Polar molecule|polar]]. The molecule's polarity, and especially, its ability to form [[hydrogen bond]]s, makes ammonia highly miscible with water. The lone pair makes ammonia a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], a proton acceptor. Ammonia is moderately basic; a 1.0 M [[aqueous solution]] has a [[pH]] of 11.6, and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral (pH = 7), 99.4% of the ammonia molecules are [[Protonation|protonated]].

The latter has the shape of a regular [[tetrahedron]] and is [[isoelectronic]] with [[methane]]. \n \n The ammonia molecule readily undergoes [[nitrogen inversion]] at room temperature; a useful analogy is an [[umbrella]] turning itself inside out in a strong wind. The energy barrier to this inversion is 24.7 kJ/mol, and the [[resonance frequency]] is 23.79 [[Hertz|GHz]], corresponding to [[microwave]] radiation of a [[wavelength]] of 1.260 & nbsp;cm.

However, recent studies have shown that efficient and stable combustion of ammonia can be achieved using swirl combustors, thereby rekindling research interest in ammonia as a fuel for thermal power production. < ref name= \" Kobayashi \" > {{cite journal |last1=Kobayashi |first1=Hideaki |last2=Hayakawa |first2=Akihiro |last3=Somarathne |first3=K.D.

[[Amine]]s can be formed by the reaction of ammonia with [[alkyl halide]]s, although the resulting -NH < sub > 2 < /sub >  group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution and neutralises the [[hydrogen halide]] formed. [[Methylamine]] is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with [[chloromethane]], and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare [[racemic]] [[alanine]] in 70% yield. [[Ethanolamine]] is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with [[ethylene oxide]]: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce [[diethanolamine]] and [[triethanolamine]]. \n \n [[Amide]]s can be prepared by the reaction of ammonia with [[carboxylic acid]] derivatives. [[Acyl chloride]]s are the most reactive, but the ammonia must be present in at least a twofold excess to neutralise the [[hydrogen chloride]] formed. [[Ester]]s and [[anhydride]]s also react with ammonia to form amides. Ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be [[Dehydration reaction|dehydrated]] to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present: temperatures of 150 \u2013 200 & nbsp;\u00b0C are required. \n \n The hydrogen in ammonia is susceptible to replacement by a myriad of substituents. When dry ammonia gas is heated with metallic [[sodium]] it converts to [[sodamide]], NaNH < sub > 2 < /sub > .{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=862}}  With chlorine, [[monochloramine]] is formed. \n \n Pentavalent ammonia is known as \u03bb < sup > 5 < /sup > -amine or, more commonly, ammonium hydride. This crystalline solid is only stable under high pressure and decomposes back into trivalent ammonia and hydrogen gas at normal conditions.

Improved E & C parameters are listed in [[ECW model]]. < /ref >   For historical reasons, ammonia is named '''ammine''' in the nomenclature of [[coordination compound]]s. Some notable ammine complexes include tetraamminediaquacopper(II) ([Cu(NH < sub > 3 < /sub > ) < sub > 4 < /sub > (H < sub > 2 < /sub > O) < sub > 2 < /sub > ] < sup > 2+ < /sup > ), a dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to a solution of copper(II) salts. Tetraamminediaquacopper(II) hydroxide is known as [[Schweizer's reagent]], and has the remarkable ability to dissolve [[cellulose]]. Diamminesilver(I) ([Ag(NH < sub > 3 < /sub > ) < sub > 2 < /sub > ] < sup > + < /sup > ) is the active species in [[Tollens' reagent]]. Formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides: [[silver chloride]] (AgCl) is soluble in dilute (2 & nbsp;M) ammonia solution, [[silver bromide]] (AgBr) is only soluble in concentrated ammonia solution, whereas [[silver iodide]] (AgI) is insoluble in aqueous ammonia. \n \n Ammine complexes of [[chromium]](III) were known in the late 19th century, and formed the basis of [[Alfred Werner]]'s revolutionary theory on the structure of coordination compounds. Werner noted only two [[isomer]]s (''fac''- and ''mer''-) of the complex [CrCl < sub > 3 < /sub > (NH < sub > 3 < /sub > ) < sub > 3 < /sub > ] could be formed, and concluded the ligands must be arranged around the metal ion at the [[wikt:vertex|vertices]] of an [[octahedron]]. This proposal has since been confirmed by [[X-ray crystallography]]. \n \n An ammine ligand bound to a metal ion is markedly more acidic than a free ammonia molecule, although [[deprotonation]] in [[aqueous solution]] is still rare. One example is the [[Mercury(I) chloride|Calomel reaction]], where the resulting amidomercury(II) compound is highly insoluble. \n \n {{block indent|HgCl < sub > 2 < /sub >  + 2 NH < sub > 3 < /sub >  \u2192 HgCl(NH < sub > 2 < /sub > ) + NH < sub > 4 < /sub > Cl}} \n \n Ammonia forms 1:1 [[adduct]]s with a variety of [[Lewis acid]]s such as [[Iodine|I < sub > 2 < /sub > ]], [[phenol]], and [[Trimethyl aluminium|Al(CH < sub > 3 < /sub > ) < sub > 3 < /sub > ]].   Ammonia is a [[HSAB theory|hard base]] (HSAB theory) and its [[ECW model|E  &  C parameters]] are E < sub > B < /sub >  = 2.31 and C  < sub > B < /sub >  = 2.04.

Total decarbonization of ammonia production and the accomplishment of net-zero targets are possible by 2050. \n \n However ammonia cannot be easily used in existing [[Otto cycle]] engines because of its very narrow [[#Combustion|flammability range]], and there are also other barriers to widespread automobile usage. In terms of raw ammonia supplies, plants would have to be built to increase production levels, requiring significant capital and energy sources.  Although it is the second most produced chemical (after sulfuric acid), the scale of ammonia production is a small fraction of world petroleum usage.

It is an important source of nitrogen for living systems. Although atmospheric nitrogen abounds (more than 75%), few living creatures are capable of using this atmospheric nitrogen in its diatomic form, N < sub > 2 < /sub >  gas. Therefore, [[nitrogen fixation]] is required for the synthesis of amino acids, which are the building blocks of [[protein]]. Some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter. Others, such as nitrogen-fixing [[legume]]s, benefit from [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with [[rhizobia]] that create ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen. < ref > {{cite web|author1=Adjei, M.

Ammonia excretion is common in aquatic animals. In humans, it is quickly converted to [[urea]], which is much less toxic, particularly less [[#Basicity|basic]]. This urea is a major component of the dry weight of [[urine]]. Most reptiles, birds, insects, and snails excrete [[uric acid]] solely as nitrogenous waste. \n \n ===In physiology=== \n Ammonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal [[physiology]]. It is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations. The [[liver]] converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the [[urea cycle]]. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in [[cirrhosis]], may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood ([[hyperammonemia]]). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as [[ornithine transcarbamylase]], lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and [[coma]] of [[hepatic encephalopathy]], as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and [[organic aciduria]]s. < ref > {{cite book|author1=Zschocke, Johannes |author2=Hoffman, Georg |title=Vademecum Metabolism|publisher= Schattauer Verlag|year= 2004|isbn=978-3794523856}} < /ref > \n \n Ammonia is important for normal animal acid/base balance. After formation of ammonium from [[glutamine]], [[\u03b1-ketoglutarate]] may be degraded to produce two [[bicarbonate]] ions, which are then available as buffers for dietary acids. Ammonium is excreted in the urine, resulting in net acid loss. Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules, combine with a hydrogen ion, and thus allow for further acid excretion. < ref > {{cite book|author1=Rose, Burton|author2=Helmut Rennke|title=Renal Pathophysiology|location=Baltimore|publisher=Williams  &  Wilkins|year=1994|isbn=978-0-683-07354-6|url=https://archive.org/details/renalpathophysio0000rose}} < /ref > \n \n ===Excretion=== \n {{Main|Excretion}} \n Ammonium ions are a [[Toxicity|toxic]] waste product of [[metabolism]] in [[animal]]s. In fish and aquatic invertebrates, it is excreted directly into the water. In mammals, sharks, and amphibians, it is converted in the [[urea cycle]] to [[urea]], because it is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently. In birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails, metabolic ammonium is converted into [[uric acid]], which is solid, and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss. < ref > {{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |author-link=Neil Campbell (scientist) |author2=Jane B.

The finding is significant because they may represent the birthplaces for the Population I metallicity B-type stars in the galactic halo that could have been borne in the galactic disk. < ref > {{cite journal|author1=Mebold, U. |author2=Heithausen, A. |author3=Reif, K.|year= 1987|journal= Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume= 180|page= 213|bibcode=1987A & A...180..213M|title=Ammonia in the galactic halo and the infrared cirrus }} < /ref > \n \n ====Observations of nearby dark clouds==== \n By balancing and stimulated emission with spontaneous emission, it is possible to construct a relation between [[excitation temperature]] and density. Moreover, since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a 2-level system at low temperatures, this calculation is fairly simple. This premise can be applied to dark clouds, regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation. Detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow lines{{snd}}indicative not only of low temperatures, but also of a low level of inner-cloud turbulence. Line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous CO observations. The ammonia observations were consistent with CO measurements of rotation temperatures of \u224810 K. With this, densities can be determined, and have been calculated to range between 10 < sup > 4 < /sup >  and 10 < sup > 5 < /sup >  cm < sup > \u22123 < /sup >  in dark clouds. Mapping of NH < sub > 3 < /sub >  gives typical clouds sizes of 0.1 [[Parsec|pc]] and masses near 1 solar mass. These cold, dense cores are the sites of future star formation. \n \n ====UC HII regions==== \n Ultra-compact HII regions are among the best tracers of high-mass star formation. The dense material surrounding UCHII regions is likely primarily molecular. Since a complete study of massive star formation necessarily involves the cloud from which the star formed, ammonia is an invaluable tool in understanding this surrounding molecular material. Since this molecular material can be spatially resolved, it is possible to constrain the heating/ionising sources, temperatures, masses, and sizes of the regions. Doppler-shifted velocity components allow for the separation of distinct regions of molecular gas that can trace outflows and hot cores originating from forming stars. \n \n ====Extragalactic detection==== \n Ammonia has been detected in external galaxies, < ref > {{Cite journal |bibcode = 1979A & A....74L...7M|title = Detection of extragalactic ammonia|journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume = 74|issue = 1|pages = L7|last1 = Martin|first1 = R.

Line ratios imply that gas temperatures are warm (\u224850 K), originating from dense clouds with sizes of tens of pc.
