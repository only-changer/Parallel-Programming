He achieved the independence of the [[County of Portugal]], establishing a new kingdom and doubling its area with the ''[[Reconquista]]'', an objective that he pursued until his death. \n \n Afonso was the son of [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|Teresa of Le\u00f3n]] and [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]], rulers of the County of Portugal. Henry died in 1112, leaving Theresa to rule alone. Unhappy with Theresa's romantic relationship with [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galician]] [[Fernando P\u00e9rez de Traba]] and his political influence, the Portuguese nobility rallied around Afonso, who revolted and defeated his mother at the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]] in 1128 and became Count of Portugal soon afterwards. In 1139, Afonso renounced the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]] and established the independent [[Kingdom of Portugal]]. \n \n Afonso actively campaigned against the Moors in the south. In 1139 he won a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Ourique]], and in 1147 he conquered [[Conquest of Santar\u00e9m|Santar\u00e9m]] and [[Siege of Lisbon|Lisbon]] from the Moors. He secured the independence of Portugal following a victory over Le\u00f3n at [[Battle of Valdevez|Valdevez]] and received papal approval through ''[[Manifestis Probatum]]''. Afonso died in 1185 and was succeeded by his son, [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]]. \n \n ==Youth== \n Afonso was the son of [[Teresa of Le\u00f3n, Countess of Portugal|Teresa]], the [[illegitimate]] daughter of King [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile]], and her husband, [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]]. According to [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes]]' ''Cr\u00f3nica de Portugal de 1419,'' the future Portuguese king was born in [[Guimar\u00e3es]], which was at the time the most important political center of his parents. This was accepted by most Portuguese scholarship until in 1990 Torquato de Sousa Soares proposed Coimbra, the center of the county of Coimbra and another political center of Afonso's progenitors, as his birthplace, which caused outrage in Guimar\u00e3es and a polemic between this historian and [[Jos\u00e9 Hermano Saraiva]]. Almeida Fernandes later proposed [[Viseu]] as the birthplace of Afonso basing himself on the ''[[Chronica Gothorum]]'', which states Afonso was born in 1109, a position followed by [[Jos\u00e9 Mattoso]] in his biography of the king.{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|pp=26\u201327 \n }}  Abel Estef\u00e2nio has suggested a different date and thesis, proposing 1106 as the birth date and the region of [[Tierra de Campos]] or even [[Sahag\u00fan]] as likely birth places based on the known itineraries of counts Henry and Teresa. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Estef\u00e2nio|first=Abel|date=July 2010|title=A data de nascimento de Afonso I|url=http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA8/estefanio8002.html|journal=Medievalista|volume=8|language=PT|access-date=14 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411011807/http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA8/estefanio8002.html|archive-date=11 April 2017|url-status=dead}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Estef\u00e2nio|first=Abel|date=January 2016|title=De novo a data e o local de nascimento de Afonso I|url=http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA19/estefanio1906.html|journal=Medievalista|volume=19|language=PT|access-date=14 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025083524/http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/MEDIEVALISTA19/estefanio1906.html|archive-date=25 October 2019|url-status=dead}} < /ref > \n \n Henry and Teresa reigned jointly as count and countess of Portugal until his death on 22 May 1112 during the siege of [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]],{{Sfn|Mattoso|2014|p=34}} after which Teresa ruled Portugal alone. < ref name= \" Gerli \" > [https://books.google.com/books?id=QlpKAgAAQBAJ & pg=PA676 & lpg=PA676 & dq=afonso+i+of+portugal & source=bl & ots=sWxOTr0U1v & sig=HbyK45MU-hykot9JlUwI7jRwtTU & hl=en & sa=X & ved=0CC0Q6AEwAzgeahUKEwi_xp_5zPvGAhUFWz4KHWWAAh8#v=onepage & q=afonso%20i%20of%20portugal & f=false Gerli, E.

Later traditions, probably started with [[Jo\u00e3o Soares Coelho]] (a bastard descendant of [[Egas Moniz]] through a female line) in the mid-13th century and ampliated by later chronicles such as the ''Cr\u00f3nica de Portugal de 1419'', asserted he had been [[Egas Moniz o Aio|Egas Moniz de Ribadouro]], possibly with the help of oral memories that associated the tutor to the house of Ribadouro. Yet, contemporary documents, namely from the chancery of Afonso in his early years as count of Portucale, indicate according to the [[historian]] [[Jos\u00e9 Mattoso]] that the most likely tutor of Afonso Henriques was Egas Moniz's oldest brother, [[Erm\u00edgio Moniz]], who, besides being the senior brother within the family of Ribadouro, became the  \" dapifer \"  and  \" [[Mayor of the Palace|majordomus]] \"  of Afonso I from 1128 until his death in 1135, which indicates his closer proximity to the prince. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Jo\u00e3o Soares Coelho e a gesta de Egas Moniz.

The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Braga|Archbishop of Braga]] was also concerned with the dominance of Galicia, apprehensive of the ecclesiastical pretensions of his new rival the Galician [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela|Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela]], [[Diego Gelm\u00edrez]], who had claimed an alleged discovery of relics of [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] in his town, as a way to gain power and riches over the other cathedrals in the Iberian Peninsula. In order to stop her son Alfonso from overthrowing her, Teresa exiled him when he was twelve in the year 1120. In 1122, Afonso turned fourteen, the adult age in the 12th century.  In symmetry with his [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile|cousin]] Alfonso made himself a [[knight]] on his own account in the [[Cathedral of Zamora]] in 1125.  After the military campaign of Alfonso VII against his mother in 1127, Afonso revolted against her and proceeded to take control of the county from its queen. \n \n == Sole count == \n In 1128, near [[Guimar\u00e3es]] at the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]], Afonso and his supporters overcame troops under both his mother and her lover, Count [[Fernando Peres de Trava]] of [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]]. Afonso exiled his mother to Galicia, and took over rule of the County of Portucale. < ref name=Gerli/ >  Thus the possibility of re-incorporating Portucale into a Kingdom of Portugal and Galicia as before was eliminated and Afonso became sole ruler following demands for greater independence from the county's church and nobles. The battle was mostly ignored by the Leonese [[suzerain]] who was occupied at the time with a revolt in Castille. He was also, most likely, waiting for the reaction of the Galician families. After Teresa's death in 1131, [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Afonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castille]] proceeded to demand vassalage from his cousin.  On 6 April 1129, Afonso Henriques dictated the [[writ]] in which he proclaimed himself Prince of Portugal or Prince of the Portuguese, an act informally allowed by Afonso VII, as it was thought to be Afonso Henriques's right by blood, as one of two grandsons of the [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile|Emperor of Hispania]]. \n \n Afonso then turned his arms against the persistent problem of the Moors in the south. His campaigns were successful and, on 25 July 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the [[Battle of Ourique]], and straight after was (possibly unanimously) proclaimed King of the Portuguese by his soldiers, establishing his equality in rank to the other realms of the Peninsula, although the first reference to his royal title dates from 1140. The first assembly of the [[Portuguese Cortes]] convened at [[Lamego]] (wherein he would have been given the crown from the Archbishop of Braga, to confirm his independence) is a 17th-century embellishment of Portuguese history.{{clarify|reason=uninterpretable grammar|date=October 2019}} \n \n == Kingship == \n Complete independence from Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n's [[suzerainty]], however, could not be achieved by military means alone. The County of Portugal still had to be acknowledged diplomatically by the neighboring lands as a kingdom and, most importantly, by the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[pope]]. Afonso wed [[Mafalda of Savoy, Queen of Portugal|Mafalda of Savoy]], daughter of Count [[Amadeus III of Savoy]], and sent ambassadors to Rome to negotiate with the pope. He succeeded in renouncing the suzerainty of his cousin, Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n, becoming instead a vassal of the papacy, as the kings of Sicily and Aragon had done before him.  \n [[Image:Siege of Lisbon - Muslim surrender.jpg|thumb|King Afonso I at the [[Siege of Lisbon]] (Oil on Canvas by Joaquim Rodrigues Braga)]] \n In Portugal he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders. He is notably the builder of [[Alcoba\u00e7a Monastery]], to which he called the [[Cistercians|Cistercian Order]] of his uncle [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. In 1143, he wrote to [[Pope Innocent II]] to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the church, swearing to pursue driving the Moors out of the Iberian Peninsula. Bypassing any king of Le\u00f3n, Afonso declared himself the direct [[wikt:liege|liege man]] of the papacy. Afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the Moors, from whom he wrested [[Santar\u00e9m, Portugal|Santar\u00e9m]] (see [[Conquest of Santar\u00e9m]]) and [[Lisbon]] in 1147 (see [[Siege of Lisbon]]). < ref name= \" EB1911 \" > {{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso I.|first=David|last=Hannay|author-link=David Hannay (historian)|volume=1|page=733}} < /ref >  He also conquered an important part of the land south of the [[Tagus]] River, although this was lost again to the Moors in the following years. \n \n Meanwhile, King Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n regarded the independent ruler of Portugal as nothing but a rebel. Conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years. Afonso became involved in a war, taking the side of the Aragonese king, an enemy of Castile. To ensure the alliance, his son [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho]] was engaged to [[Dulce of Aragon]]. Finally after winning the [[Battle of Valdevez]], the [[Treaty of Zamora (1143)]] established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n that Portugal was a fully independent kingdom. \n \n In 1169 the now old King Afonso was possibly disabled in an engagement near [[Badajoz]], by a fall from his horse and slamming against the castle gate, and made prisoner by the soldiers of King [[Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n]], his son-in-law. He spent months at the [[S\u00e3o Pedro do Sul, Portugal|hot springs of S\u00e3o Pedro do Sul]], but never recovered and from this time onward the Portuguese king never rode a horse again. However, it is not certain if this was because of the disability: according to the later Portuguese chronistic tradition, this happened because Afonso would have to surrender himself again to Ferdinand or risk war between the two kingdoms if he ever rode a horse again. Portugal was obliged to surrender as his ransom almost all the conquests Afonso had made in Galicia (north of the [[Minho River]]) in the previous years. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  This event became known in Portuguese history as the Disaster of Badajoz (''o Desastre de Badajoz'').  \n [[Image:BatalhaOurique.jpg|thumb|left|Afonso at the [[Battle of Ourique]] witnessing the Miracle of the Cross (dated 1793 by Domigos Sequeira)]] \n \n In 1179 the privileges and favors given to the [[Catholic Church]] were compensated. With consistent effort by several parties, such as the [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] [[archbishop of Braga]], [[Paio Mendes]], in the papal court, the [[papal bull]] ''[[Manifestis Probatum]]'' was promulgated accepting the new king as vassal to the pope exclusively. In it [[Pope Alexander III]] also acknowledged Afonso as king and Portugal as an independent kingdom with the right to conquer lands from the Moors. \n \n In 1184, the Almohad caliph [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf]] rallied a great [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] force to retaliate against the Portuguese raids done since the end of a five-year truce in 1178 and besieged [[Santar\u00e9m, Portugal|Santar\u00e9m]], which was defended by Afonso's son [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho]]. The Almohad siege failed when news arrived the [[archbishop of Compostella]] had come to the defense of the city and Fernando II of Le\u00f3n himself with his army. The Almohads ended the siege and their retreat turned into a rout due to panic in their camp, with the Almohad caliph being injured in the process (according to one version, because of a [[crossbow]] bolt) and dying on the way back to [[Seville]]. Afonso died shortly after on 6 December 1185. The Portuguese revere him as a hero, both on account of his personal character and as the founder of their nation. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  There are mythical stories that it took 10 men to carry his sword, and that Afonso wanted to engage other monarchs in personal combat, but no one would dare accept his challenge. It is also told, despite his honourable character, that he had a temper. Several chronicles give the example of a papal legate that brought a message from the [[Pope Paschal II]] refusing to acknowledge Afonso's claim as king: either after committing or saying a small offense against him or after being simply read the letter, Afonso almost killed, in his rage, the papal representative, taking several portucalense nobles and soldiers to physically restrain the young would-be king. \n \n ==Scientific research== \n [[Image:AfonsoHenriques-Tomb.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Afonso Henriques in the [[Monastery of Santa Cruz (Coimbra)|Santa Cruz Monastery]] in [[Coimbra]].]] \n In July 2006, the tomb of the king (which is located in the [[Monastery of Santa Cruz (Coimbra)|Santa Cruz Monastery]] in [[Coimbra]]) was to be opened for scientific purposes by researchers from the [[University of Coimbra]] (Portugal) and the [[University of Granada]] (Spain). The opening of the tomb provoked considerable concern among some sectors of Portuguese society and Portuguese State Agency for Architectural Patrimony (''Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Patrim\u00f3nio Arquitect\u00f3nico'' \u2013 [[IPPAR]]) halted the opening, requesting more protocols from the scientific team because of the importance of the king in the nation's heart and public thought. < ref > [http://dossiers.publico.pt/shownews.asp?id=1263265 & idCanal=1806 ''IPPAR: direc\u00e7\u00e3o nacional diz que n\u00e3o foi consultada sobre abertura do t\u00famulo de D.
