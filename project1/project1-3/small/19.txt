[[File:Aletschgebiet aus dem Flugzeug.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Unteraargletscher]]]] \n [[File:Ausgang Aareschlucht.jpg|thumb|The Aare at [[Innertkirchen]]]] \n [[File:Aareschlucht 166 7.jpg|thumb|Inside the Aare Gorge]] \n \n The Aare rises in the great [[Aargletschers]] (Aare Glaciers) of the [[Bernese Alps]], in the [[canton of Bern]] and west of the [[Grimsel Pass]]. < ref name= \" CVDE \" / >  The [[Finsteraarhorn|Finsteraargletscher]] and [[Lauteraarhorn|Lauteraargletscher]] come together to form the [[Unteraargletscher]] (Lower Aar Glacier), which is the main source of water for the [[Grimselsee]] (Lake of Grimsel). < ref name=GH > {{harvnb|Gresswell|Huxley|1965|p=27}} < /ref > < ref name=cohen > {{harvnb|Cohen|1998|p=1}} < /ref >  The [[Oberaargletscher]] (Upper Aar Glacier) feeds the [[Oberaarsee]], which also flows into the Grimselsee. < ref name=GH/ >  The Aare leaves the Grimselsee just to the east to the Grimsel Hospiz, below the [[Grimsel Pass]], and then flows northwest through the [[Haslital]], forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall, {{convert|46|m|ft|abbr=on}}, past [[Guttannen]]. \n \n Right after [[Innertkirchen]] it is joined by its first major tributary, the Gamderwasser. Less than {{convert|1|km}} later the river carves through a [[limestone]] ridge in the [[Aare Gorge]] ({{lang-de|Aareschlucht}}). < ref name=CVDE / >  It is here that the Aare proves itself to be more than just a river, as it attracts thousands of tourists annually to the causeways through the gorge. < ref name=GH/ >  A little past [[Meiringen]], near [[Brienz]], the river expands into [[Lake Brienz]]. Near the west end of the lake it indirectly receives its first important [[tributary]], the [[L\u00fctschine]], by the Lake of Brienz. It then runs across the swampy plain of the B\u00f6deli (Swiss German diminutive for ground) between [[Interlaken]] and [[Unterseen]] before flowing into [[Lake Thun]]. < ref name=CVDE / > \n \n Near the west end of Lake Thun, the river indirectly receives the waters of the [[Kander (Switzerland)|Kander]], which has just been joined by the [[Simme]], by the Lake of Thun. Lake Thun marks the [[head of navigation]]. < ref name=cohen/ >  On flowing out of the lake it passes through [[Thun]], and then flows through the city of [[Bern]], passing beneath [[List of Aare bridges in Bern|eighteen bridges]] and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the [[Old City of Berne]] is located. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the [[Saane/Sarine|Saane or La Sarine]] it turns north until it nears [[Aarberg]]. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the [[Jura water correction]], the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a [[swampland]] through frequent flooding, was diverted by the Aare-Hagneck Canal into the [[Lac de Bienne]]. From the upper end of the lake, at [[Nidau]], the river issues through the [[Nidau-B\u00fcren Canal]], also called the Aare Canal, < ref name=GH/ >  and then runs east to [[B\u00fcren, Solothurn|B\u00fcren]]. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the  \" vegetable garden of Switzerland \" . \n \n From here the Aare flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town [[Solothurn]] < ref name=CVDE / >  (below which the Grosse [[Emme (river)|Emme]] flows in on the right), [[Aarburg]] (where it is joined by the [[Wigger (river)|Wigger]]), [[Olten]], [[Aarau]], < ref name=CVDE / >  near which is the junction with the [[Suhre]], and Wildegg, where the Seetal [[Aabach (Seetal)|Aabach]] falls in on the right. A short distance further, below [[Brugg]] it receives first the [[Reuss (river)|Reuss]], its major tributary, and shortly afterwards the [[Limmat]], its second strongest tributary. It now turns to north, and soon becomes itself a tributary of the [[Rhine]], which it even surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite downstream from [[Koblenz, Switzerland|Koblenz (Switzerland)]], opposite [[Waldshut-Tiengen|Waldshut]] in Germany. The Rhine, in turn, empties into the [[North Sea]] after crossing into the [[Netherlands]]. \n \n == Tributaries == \n [[File:Aare - Limmat (Limmatspitz) IMG 6765.jpg|thumb|At the  \" Wasserschloss \" , where the rivers Aare, Reuss and Limmat flow together]] \n [[File:Bern 2.jpg|thumb|Aare in [[Bern]]]] \n [[File:London2007zurich img 5743.jpg|thumb|The convergence of the Aare and the Rhine at Koblenz]] \n \n *[[Limmat]] (after and northeast of [[Brugg]], and northwest of [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]]) \n **[[Reppisch]] \n **[[Sihl]] \n ***[[Alp (river)|Alp]] \n ***[[Minster (river)|Minster]] \n **[[Lake Zurich]] \n ***Linthkanal \n ****[[Lake Walen]] \n *****[[Linth]] \n ******L\u00f6ntsch \n ******[[Sernf]] \n ******Fl\u00e4tschbach \n *****[[Seez (river)|Seez]] \n *[[Reuss (river)|Reuss]] (after and northeast of [[Brugg]], and northwest of Baden) \n **[[Lorze]] \n **[[Kleine Emme]] \n **[[Lake Lucerne]] \n ***[[Sarner Aa]] \n ***[[Engelberger Aa]] \n ***[[Muota (river)|Muota]] \n **[[Sch\u00e4chen]] \n **[[Ch\u00e4rstelenbach]] \n **G\u00f6schener Reuss \n *[[Aabach (Seetal)|Aabach]] (coming from Seetal, in [[M\u00f6riken-Wildegg|Wildegg]]) \n **B\u00fcnz \n *[[Suhre]] (after and north of [[Aarau]]) \n **Wyna \n *Aabach (from the left in Aarau) \n *Stegbach \n *D\u00fcnnern (in [[Olten]]) \n *[[Wigger (river)|Wigger]] (right before [[Aarburg]]) \n *[[Murg (Aare)|Murg]] (before, west of [[Murgenthal]]) \n **Rot ([[Roggwil, Bern|Roggwil]]) \n **Langete ([[Langenthal]]) \n ***Ursenbach (Kleindietwil) \n ***Rotbach ([[Huttwil]]) \n *[[Emme (river)|(Grosse) Emme]] (after, east of [[Solothurn]]) \n *[[Lake of Bienne]] \n **[[Suze (river)|La Suze]] (in [[Biel/Bienne]], right next to the outflow) \n **[[Zihlkanal]] \n ***[[Lake of Neuchatel]] \n ****[[Broye|La Broye]] (flows through [[Lake Morat]]) \n ****[[Zihl|Zihl/La Thielle]] \n *****[[Orbe (river)|L'Orbe]] \n *****Le Talent \n *[[Saane/Sarine|Saane/La Sarine]] (after, west of Wohlensee) \n **[[Sense (river)|Sense]] \n *[[G\u00fcrbe]] (in [[Muri bei Bern]]) \n *Zulg (west of [[Steffisburg]]) \n *[[Lake Thun]] \n **[[Kander (Switzerland)|Kander]] (west of [[Spiez]]) \n ***[[Simme]] \n ***Entschlige \n *[[Lake Brienz]] \n **[[L\u00fctschine]] (at the end of Lake Brienz, right next to the outflow) \n *[[Gadmerwasser]] (right after, northwest of [[Innertkirchen]]) \n \n ==Reservoirs== \n * [[Lake Grimsel]], < ref name=a1 > {{harvnb|Anon|1973|p=74}} < /ref >  {{convert|1908|m|ft}} \n * [[Lake Brienz]], < ref name=a1/ >  {{convert|564|m|ft}} < ref name=GH1 > {{harvnb|Gresswell|Huxley|1965|p=272}} < /ref > \n * [[Lake Thun]], < ref name=a1/ >  {{convert|558|m|ft}} < ref name=GH1/ > \n * [[Lake Wohlen]], < ref name=a2 > {{harvnb|Anon|1973|p=70}} < /ref >  {{convert|481|m|ft}} \n * [[Niederriedsee]], < ref name=a2/ >  {{convert|461|m|ft}} \n * [[Lake Biel]], < ref name=a2/ >  {{convert|429|m|ft}} \n * [[Klingnauer Stausee]], {{convert|318|m|ft}} \n \n ==Notes== \n {{reflist|group=nb}} \n \n ==Footnotes== \n {{Reflist}} \n \n ==References== \n * {{cite book | author = Anon | year = 1973 | title = Atlas Routier et Touristique | language = French | publisher = Bordas-Tirade | location = Paris, France }} \n * {{cite encyclopedia | editor1-last = Bridgwater | editor1-first = W.| editor2-last = Aldrich | editor2-first = Beatrice | encyclopedia = The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia | title = Aare | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York, NY | year = 1968 | isbn = 978-0670230709 | edition = 3rd }} \n * {{cite encyclopedia | editor-last = Cohen | editor-first = Saul B. | encyclopedia = The Columbia Gazetteer of the World | title = Aare | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-231-11040-5 | year = 1998 }} \n * {{cite book | last = Forbiger | first = Albert | title = Handbuch Der Alten Geographie | volume = 3 | publisher = Veriag von Gustav Mayer | location = Leipzig, Germany | year = 1848 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AvwoAAAAYAAJ & pg=PA127 }} \n * {{cite book | editor-last1 = Gresswell | editor-first1 = R.
