He had an office in the [[Library of Alexandria]], and was commissioned by Ptolemy to make a collection of all the tragedies and satyric dramas that were extant. He spent some time, together with [[Antagoras]] and [[Aratus]], at the court of [[Antigonus II Gonatas]]. < ref > [[Aratus]], ''Phaenomena et Diosem.'' ii. pp. 431, 443,  & c. 446, ed.

Among his [[epic poem]]s, we possess the titles and some fragments of three pieces: the ''Fisherman'', < ref > {{lang|grc|\u1f01\u03bb\u03b9\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2}}, [[Athenaeus]], vii. p. 296 < /ref >  ''Kirka'' or ''Krika'', < ref > [[Athenaeus]], vii. p. 283 < /ref >  which, however, is designated by [[Athenaeus]] as doubtful, and ''Helena'', < ref > [[August Immanuel Bekker]], ''Anecdota Graeca'' p. 96 < /ref >   Of his elegies, some beautiful fragments are still extant. < ref > [[Athenaeus]], iv. p. 170, xi. p. 496, xv. p. 899 < /ref > < ref > [[Strabo]], xii. p. 556, xiv. p. 681 < /ref > < ref > Parthen.
