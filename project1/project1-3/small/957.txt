The Fa'asamoa is the language and customs, and the Fa'amatai the protocols of the  \" [[fono]] \"  (council) and the chiefly system. The Fa'amatai and the Fono take place at all levels of the Samoan body politic, from the family, to the village, to the region, to national matters. The  \" matai \"  (chiefs) are elected by consensus within the fono of the extended family and village(s) concerned. The matai and the fono (which is itself made of matai) decide on distribution of family exchanges and tenancy of communal lands. The majority of lands in American Samoa and independent Samoa are communal. A matai can represent a small family group or a great extended family that reaches across islands, and to both American Samoa and independent Samoa. \n \n ==Government== \n {{main|Government of American Samoa}} \n \n The [[government of American Samoa]] is defined under the [[Constitution of American Samoa]].
