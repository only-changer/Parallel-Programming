This number, also known as the [[international poverty line]], is periodically updated to account for inflation and differences in the cost of living; < ref > Page 370 in Sala-i-Martin, Xavier.  \" The world distribution of income: falling poverty and convergence period. \"  The Quarterly Journal of Economics 121.2 (2006): 351-397. < /ref >  it was originally defined at $1.00 a day in 1996. The updates are made according to new price data to portray the costs of basic food, health services, clothing, and shelter around the world as accurately as possible. The latest revision was made in 2015 when the World Bank increased the line to [[Geary\u2013Khamis dollar|international-$]]1.90. \n \n Because many of the world's poorest people do not have a monetary income, the poverty measurement is based on the monetary value of a person's ''consumption''. Otherwise the poverty measurement would be missing the home production of [[subsistence farmer]]s that consume largely their own production. \n \n ===Alternative definitions=== \n [[File:Share of population living in multidimensional poverty, 2014.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Share of population living in multidimensional poverty in 2014]] \n The $1.90/day extreme poverty line remains the most widely used metric as it highlights the reality of those in the most severe conditions. < ref name= \" usaid1 \" > [http://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1870/USAID-Extreme-Poverty-Discussion-Paper.pdf  \" Getting to Zero: USAID Discussion Paper \" ], 21 November 2013. < /ref >  Although widely used by most international organizations, it has come under scrutiny due to a variety of factors. For example, it does not account for how far below the line people are, referred to as the depth of poverty. For this purpose, the same institutions publish data on the [[Poverty gap index|poverty gap]]. \n \n The international poverty line is designed to stay constant over time, to allow comparisons between different years. It is therefore a measure of absolute poverty and is not measuring [[relative poverty]]. It is also not designed to capture how people view their own financial situation (known as the socially subjective poverty line). < ref > {{Cite web|url = https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/3254/WPS5968.pdf|title = Poor, or Just Feeling Poor?|date = February 2012|website = The World Bank Open Knowledge Repository|author=Martin Ravallion}} < /ref >   Moreover, the calculation of the poverty line relies on information about consumer prices to calculate [[purchasing power parity]], which are very hard to measure and are necessarily debatable. As with all other metrics, there may also be missing data from the poorest and most fragile countries. \n \n Several alternative instruments for measuring extreme poverty have been suggested which incorporate other factors such as malnutrition and lack of access to a basic education. The [[Multidimensional Poverty Index]] (MPI), based on the [[Sabina Alkire|Alkire]]-[[James Foster (economist)|Foster]] Method, is published by the [[Oxford Poverty  &  Human Development Initiative]] (OPHI): it measures deprivation in basic needs and can be broken down to reflect both the incidence and the intensity of poverty. For example, under conventional measures, in both Ethiopia and Uzbekistan about 40% of the population is considered extremely poor, but based on the MPI, 90% of Ethiopians but only 2% of Uzbekistanis are in multidimensional poverty. < ref > Dan Morrell.[http://harvardmagazine.com/2011/01/who-is-poor  \" Who Is Poor? \" ], [[Harvard Magazine]]. January\u2013February 2011. < /ref > \n \n The MPI is useful for development officials to determine the most likely causes of poverty within a region, using the M0 measure of the method (which is calculated by multiplying the fraction of people in poverty by the fraction of dimensions they are deprived in). < ref > OPHI.[http://www.ophi.org.uk/research/multidimensional-poverty/alkire-foster-method/  \" Alkire-Foster Method \" ], 2014. < /ref >  For example, in the [[Gaza Strip]] of Palestine, using the M0 measure of the Alkire-Foster method reveals that poverty in the region is primarily caused by a lack of access to electricity, lack of access to drinking water, and widespread overcrowding. In contrast, data from the [[Chhukha District]] of [[Bhutan]] reveals that income is a much larger contributor to poverty as opposed to other dimensions within the region. < ref > Sabina Alkire and James Foster.[http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/oc63ch03.pdf  \" Counting and Multidimensional Poverty \" ], [[International Food Policy Research Institute]]. < /ref >  However, the MPI only presents data from 105 countries, so it cannot be used for global measurements. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://ophi.org.uk/multidimensional-poverty-index/global-mpi-2018/|title=Global MPI 2018|website=ophi.org.uk|access-date=10 March 2019}} < /ref > \n \n ==Share of the population living in extreme poverty== \n [[File:Share of the population living in extreme poverty.png|thumb|Share of the population pushed below the $1.90 ($ 2011 PPP) poverty line by out-of-pocket health care expenditure in 2015 by region]] \n [[File:Share-of-the-population-living-in-extreme-poverty.png|thumb|Share of the population living in extreme poverty]] \n [[File:Share-of-the-population-living-in-extreme-poverty-in-selected-parts-of-the-world.png|thumb|Share of the population living in extreme poverty in selected parts of the world]] \n \n 89,689,700 people were pushed below the $1.90 ($2011 PPP) poverty line by out-of-pocket health care expenditure in 2015 in the world.

Nearly half of them live in India and China, with more than 85% living in just 20 countries. Since the mid-1990s, there has been a steady decline in both the worldwide poverty rate and the total number of extreme poor. In 1990, the percentage of the global population living in extreme poverty was 43%, but in 2011, that percentage had dropped down to 21%. < ref name= \" usaid1 \" / >  This halving of the extreme poverty rate falls in line with the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG1) proposed by former UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], who called on the international community at the turn of the century to reduce the percentage of people in extreme poverty by half by 2015. < ref name= \" Annan_2000 \" / > \n \n This reduction in extreme poverty took place most notably in China, Indonesia, India, Pakistan and Vietnam. These five countries accounted for the alleviation of 715 million people out of extreme poverty between 1990 and 2010 \u2013 more than the global net total of roughly 700 million. This statistical oddity can be explained by the fact that the number of people living in extreme poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa rose from 290 million to 414 million over the same period. < ref name= \" autogenerated1 \" > United Nations.[https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/report-2013/mdg-report-2013-english.pdf  \" The Millennium Development Goals Report \" ], 2013. < /ref >  However, there have been many positive signs for extensive, global poverty reduction as well. Since 1999, the total number of extreme poor has declined by an average of 50 million per year.

If we remain on our current trajectory, many economists predict we could reach global zero by 2030\u20132035, thus ending extreme poverty. Global zero entails a world in which fewer than 3% of the global population lives in extreme poverty (projected under most optimistic scenarios to be fewer than 200 million people). This zero figure is set at 3% in recognition of the fact that some amount of frictional (temporary) poverty will continue to exist, whether it is caused by political conflict or unexpected economic fluctuations, at least for the foreseeable future. < ref name= \" worldbank1 \" > World Bank.[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPROSPECTS/Resources/334934-1327948020811/8401693-1397074077765/Prosperity_for_All_Final_2014.pdf  \" Prosperity for All: Ending Extreme Poverty \" ], Spring 2014. < /ref >  However, the [[Brookings Institution]] notes that any projection about poverty more than a few years into the future runs the risk of being highly uncertain.

Recent World Bank research shows that some countries can get caught in a  \" fragility trap \" , in which self-reinforcing factors prevent the poorest nations from emerging from low-level equilibrium in the long run. < ref name= \" worldbank2 \" > World Bank.[http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Feature%20Story/Stop_Conflict_Reduce_Fragility_End_Poverty.pdf  \" Stop Conflict, Reduce Fragility and End Poverty: Doing Things Differently in Fragile and Conflict-affected Situations \" ], 2013. < /ref >  Moreover, most of the reduction in extreme poverty over the past twenty years has taken place in countries that have not experienced a civil conflict or have had governing institutions with a strong capacity to actually govern. Thus, to end extreme poverty, it is also important to focus on the interrelated problems of fragility and conflict. \n \n USAID defines fragility as a government's lack of both legitimacy (the perception the government is adequate at doing its job) and effectiveness (how good the government is at maintaining law and order, in an equitable manner). As fragile nations are unable to equitably and effectively perform the functions of a state, these countries are much more prone to violent unrest and mass inequality. Additionally, in countries with high levels of inequality (a common problem in countries with inadequate governing institutions), much higher growth rates are needed to reduce the rate of poverty when compared with other nations. Additionally, if China and India are removed from the equation, up to 70% of the world's poor live in fragile states by some definitions of fragility. Some analysts project that extreme poverty will be increasingly concentrated in fragile, low-income states like Haiti, Yemen and the Central African Republic. < ref > Nancy Lindborg.[http://blog.usaid.gov/2014/02/to-end-extreme-poverty-tackle-fragility/  \" To End Extreme Poverty, Tackle Fragility \" ], USAID. 13 February 2014. < /ref >  However, some academics, such as [[Andy Sumner]], say that extreme poverty will be increasingly concentrated in middle-income countries, creating a paradox where the world's poor don't actually live in the poorest countries. < ref > Andy Summer.[http://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/1426481_file_Sumner_where_in_the_world_FINAL_0.pdf  \" Where Will the World's Poor Live?

This represents an important step towards redressing the problem of fragility as it was originally articulated by self-identified fragile states who called on the international community to not only  \" do things differently \" , but to also  \" do different things \" . < ref name= \" pnaec864 \" > USAID.[http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnaec864.pdf  \" Ending Extreme Poverty in fragile contexts \" ], 28 January 2014. < /ref > \n \n Civil conflict also remains a prime cause for the perpetuation of poverty throughout the developing world. Armed conflict can have severe effects on economic growth for many reasons such as the destruction of assets, destruction of livelihoods, creation of unwanted mass migration, and diversion of public resources towards war. < ref name= \" pnaec864 \" / >  Significantly, a country that experienced major violence during 1981\u20132005 had extreme poverty rates 21 percentage points higher than a country with no violence. On average, each civil conflict will cost a country roughly 30 years of GDP growth. < ref name= \" worldbank2 \" / >  Therefore, a renewed commitment from the international community to address the deteriorating situation in highly fragile states is necessary to both prevent the mass loss of life, but to also prevent the vicious cycle of extreme poverty. \n \n Population trends and dynamics (e.g. population growth) can also have a large impact on prospects for poverty reduction.

Notably, the conference brought together more than 170 Heads of State. While world leaders at the summit were encouraged by the reduction of poverty in some nations, they were concerned by the uneven decline of poverty within and among different regions of the globe. However, at the end of the summit, the conference attendees reaffirmed the UN's commitment to achieve the MDGs by 2015 and urged all supranational, national and non-governmental organizations to follow suit. \n \n ===Sustainable Development Goals=== \n [[File:Sustainable Development Goals.png|thumb|right|Sustainable Development Goals]] \n \n As the expiration of the Millennium Development Goals approached in 2015, the UN convened a panel to advise on a [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]], which led to a new set of 17 goals for 2030 titled the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs). The first goal ([[Sustainable Development Goal 1|SDG 1]]) is to  \" End poverty in all its forms everywhere. \" < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-1-no-poverty.html|title=Goal 1: No poverty|website=UNDP|access-date=13 April 2017}} < /ref > \n \n The HLP report, entitled A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies Through Sustainable Development, was published in May 2013.

We recommend to the Secretary-General that deliberations on a new development agenda must be guided by the vision of eradicating extreme poverty once and for all, in the context of sustainable development. < /blockquote > \n \n Therefore, the report determined that a central goal of the Post-Millennium Development agenda is to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. However, the report also emphasized that the MDGs were not enough on their own, as they did not  \" focus on the devastating effects of conflict and violence on development\u2026the importance to development of good governance and institution\u2026nor the need for [[inclusive growth]]... \"  Consequently, there now exists synergy between the policy position papers put forward by the United States (through USAID), the World Bank and the UN itself in terms of viewing fragility and a lack of good governance as exacerbating extreme poverty. However, in a departure from the views of other organizations, the commission also proposed that the UN focus not only on extreme poverty (a line drawn at $1.25), but also on a higher target, such as $2. The report notes this change could be made to reflect the fact that escaping extreme poverty is only a first step. < ref > High Level Panel of Eminent Persons.

This program, which was unanimously adopted by the conference attendees, argued for internal reforms in LDCs (meant to encourage economic growth) to be complemented by strong international measures. However, despite the major economic and policy reforms initiated many of these LDCs, in addition to strong international aid, the economic situation of these countries worsened as a whole in the 1980s. This prompted the organization of a 2nd UN LDC conference almost a decade later. \n \n The second UN LDC Conference was held between 3 and 14 September 1990, once again in Paris, the second UN LDC Conference was convened to measure the progress made by the LDCs towards fulfilling their development goals during the 1980s. Recognizing the problems that plagued the LDCs over the past decade, the conference formulated a new set of national and international policies to accelerate the growth rates of the poorest nations. These new principles were embodied in the  \" Paris Declaration and Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s \" . < ref > United Nations.

It was held in May 2011 in Istanbul, recognized that the nature of development had fundamentally changed since the 1st conference held almost 30 years earlier. In the 21st century, the capital flow into emerging economies has increasingly become dominated by foreign direct investment and remittances, as opposed to bilateral and multilateral assistance. Moreover, since the 80s, significant structural changes have taken place on the international stage. With the creation of the G-20 conference of the largest economic powers, including many nations in the Global South, formerly undeveloped nations are now able to have a much larger say in international relations. Furthermore, the conference recognized that in the midst of a deep global recession, coupled with multiple crises (energy, climate, food, etc.), the international community would have fewer resources to aid the LDCs. Thus, the UN considered the participation of a wide range of stakeholders (not least the LDCs themselves), crucial to the formulation of the conference. \n \n ==Organizations working to end extreme poverty== \n ===International organizations=== \n ====World Bank==== \n [[File:World Bank Group.png|thumb|right| Nations of the World Bank Group-WBG]] \n [[File:World Bank logo.svg|thumb|right|World Bank logo]] \n In 2013, the Board of Governors of the [[World Bank Group]] (WBG) set two overriding goals for the WBG to commit itself to in the future. First, to end extreme poverty by 2030, an objective that echoes the sentiments of the UN and the Obama administration. Additionally, the WBG set an interim target of reducing extreme poverty to below 9 percent by 2020. Second, to focus on growth among the bottom 40 percent of people, as opposed to standard GDP growth. This commitment ensures that the growth of the developing world lifts people out of poverty, rather than exacerbating inequality. < ref name= \" worldbank1 \" / > \n \n As the World Bank's primary focus is on delivering economic growth to enable equitable prosperity, its developments programs are primarily commercial-based in nature, as opposed to the UN. Since the World Bank recognizes better jobs will result in higher income and thus, less poverty, the WBG seeks to support employment training initiatives, small business development programs and strong labor protection laws. However, since much of the growth in the developing world has been inequitable, the World Bank has also begun teaming with client states to map out trends in inequality and to propose public policy changes that can level the playing field. < ref > World Bank. [http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview#2  \" Poverty Overview \" ], 2014. < /ref > \n \n Moreover, the World Bank engages in a variety of nutritional, transfer payments and transport-based initiatives. Children who experience under-nutrition from conception to two years of age have a much higher risk of physical and mental disability. Thus, they are often trapped in poverty and are unable to make a full contribution to the social and economic development of their communities as adults. The WBG estimates that as much as 3% of GDP can be lost as a result of under-nutrition among the poorest nations. To combat undernutrition, the WBG has partnered with UNICEF and the WHO to ensure all small children are fully fed. The WBG also offers conditional cash transfers to poor households who meet certain requirements such as maintaining children's healthcare or ensuring school attendance. Finally, the WBG understands investment in public transportation and better roads is key to breaking rural isolation, improving access to healthcare and providing better job opportunities for the World's poor. < ref > World Bank.
