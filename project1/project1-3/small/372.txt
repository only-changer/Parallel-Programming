A notable example of this is [[Gregor Mendel|Gregor Mendel's]] discovery that the white and purple flower colors in [[pea]] plants were the result of  \" pure line \"  traits, that is a single gene with two alleles. \n \n Nearly all [[multicellular organism]]s have two sets of [[chromosome]]s at some point in their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]; that is, they are [[diploid]]. In this case, the chromosomes can be [[homologous chromosome|paired]]. Each chromosome in the pair contains the same genes in the same order, and place, along the length of the chromosome. For [[Locus (genetics)|a given gene]], if the  two chromosomes contain the same allele, they, and the organism, are [[homozygous]] with respect to that gene. If the alleles are different, they, and the organism, are [[heterozygous]] with respect to that gene. \n \n ==Etymology== \n The word  \" allele \"  is a short form of '''allelomorph''' ( \" other form \" , a word coined by British geneticists [[William Bateson]] and [[Edith Rebecca Saunders]]), < ref > {{cite web | last = Craft | first = Jude | title = Genes and genetics: the language of scientific discovery | work = Genes and genetics | publisher = [[Oxford English Dictionary]] | date = 2013 | url = http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/shapers-of-english/genes-and-genetics-the-language-of-scientific-discovery/ | access-date = 2016-01-14 }} < /ref > < ref > Bateson, W. and Saunders, E. R. (1902)  \" The facts of heredity in the light of Mendel\u2019s discovery. \"  Reports to the Evolution Committee of the Royal Society, '''I.''' pp. 125\u2013160 < /ref >  which was used in the early days of [[genetics]] to describe variant forms of a [[gene]] detected as different [[phenotypes]]. It derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] prefix \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf-, ''allelo-'', meaning  \" mutual \" ,  \" reciprocal \" , or  \" each other \" , which itself is related to the Greek adjective \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, ''allos'' (cognate with [[Latin]] ''alius''), meaning  \" other \" . \n \n ==Alleles that lead to dominant or recessive phenotypes== \n {{main|Dominance (genetics)}} \n In many cases, genotypic interactions between the two alleles at a locus can be described as [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] or [[recessive]], according to which of the two homozygous phenotypes the [[heterozygote]] most resembles. Where the heterozygote is indistinguishable from one of the homozygotes, the allele expressed is the one that leads to the  \" dominant \"  phenotype, < ref name= \" Essential genetics: A genomics perspective \" / >  and the other allele is said to be  \" recessive \" . The degree and pattern of dominance varies among loci. This type of interaction was first formally-described by [[Gregor Mendel]]. However, many traits defy this simple categorization and the phenotypes are modeled by [[co-dominance]] and [[Quantitative trait locus|polygenic inheritance]]. \n \n The term  \" [[wild type]] \"  allele is sometimes used to describe an allele that is thought to contribute to the typical phenotypic character as seen in  \" wild \"  populations of organisms, such as fruit flies (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''). Such a  \" wild type \"  allele was historically regarded as leading to a dominant (overpowering - always expressed), common, and normal phenotype, in contrast to  \" [[mutant]] \"  alleles that lead to recessive, rare, and frequently deleterious phenotypes. It was formerly thought that most individuals were homozygous for the  \" wild type \"  allele at most gene loci, and that any alternative  \" mutant \"  allele was found in homozygous form in a small minority of  \" affected \"  individuals, often as [[genetic diseases]], and more frequently in heterozygous form in  \" [[Genetic carrier|carriers]] \"  for the mutant allele. It is now appreciated that most or all gene loci are highly polymorphic, with multiple alleles, whose frequencies vary from population to population, and that a great deal of genetic variation is hidden in the form of alleles that do not produce obvious phenotypic differences. \n \n ==Multiple alleles== \n {{multiple image \n | footer    = [[Eye color]] is an inherited trait influenced by [[Polygene|more than one gene]], including ''[[OCA2]]'' and ''[[HERC2]]''. The interaction of multiple genes\u2014and the variation in these genes ( \" alleles \" ) between individuals\u2014help to determine a person's eye color [[phenotype]]. Eye color is influenced by [[pigment]]ation of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and the frequency-dependence of the light [[scattering]] by the [[Turbidity|turbid]] medium within the [[Stroma of iris|stroma]] of the iris. \n | width     = 140 \n | direction = horizontal \n | image1    = Deep Blue eye.jpg \n | image2   = Beautiful green eye.jpg \n | image3    = Hazel eye1.png \n | image4    = Lens5.jpg \n }} \n [[File:ABO blood type.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|In the [[ABO blood group system]], a person with Type A blood displays A-antigens and may have a genotype I < sup > A < /sup > I < sup > A < /sup >  or I < sup > A < /sup > i. A person with Type B blood displays B-antigens and may have the genotype I < sup > B < /sup > I < sup > B < /sup >  or I < sup > B < /sup > i. A person with Type AB blood displays both A- and B-antigens and has the genotype I < sup > A < /sup > I < sup > B < /sup >  and a person with Type O blood, displaying neither antigen, has the genotype ii.]] \n \n A population or [[species]] of organisms typically includes multiple alleles at each locus among various individuals. Allelic variation at a locus is measurable as the number of alleles ([[Genetic polymorphism|polymorphism]]) present, or the proportion of heterozygotes in the population. A [[null allele]] is a gene variant that lacks the gene's normal function because it either is not expressed, or the expressed protein is inactive. \n \n For example, at the gene locus for the [[ABO]] [[blood type]] [[carbohydrate]] [[antigen]]s in humans, < ref name= \" OnlineMendelianInheritanceinMan \" / >  classical genetics recognizes three alleles, I < sup > A < /sup > , I < sup > B < /sup > , and i, which determine compatibility of [[blood transfusion]]s. Any individual has one of six possible [[genotype]]s (I < sup > A < /sup > I < sup > A < /sup > , I < sup > A < /sup > i, I < sup > B < /sup > I < sup > B < /sup > , I < sup > B < /sup > i, I < sup > A < /sup > I < sup > B < /sup > , and ii) which produce one of four possible [[phenotype]]s:  \" Type A \"  (produced by I < sup > A < /sup > I < sup > A < /sup >  homozygous and I < sup > A < /sup > i heterozygous genotypes),  \" Type B \"  (produced by I < sup > B < /sup > I < sup > B < /sup >  homozygous and I < sup > B < /sup > i heterozygous genotypes),  \" Type AB \"  produced by I < sup > A < /sup > I < sup > B < /sup >  heterozygous genotype, and  \" Type O \"  produced by ii homozygous genotype. (It is now known that each of the A, B, and O alleles is actually a class of multiple alleles with different DNA sequences that produce proteins with identical properties: more than 70 alleles are known at the ABO locus. < ref name= \" Sequence variation at the human ABO locus \" / >  Hence an individual with  \" Type A \"  blood may be an AO heterozygote, an AA homozygote, or an AA heterozygote with two different  \" A \"  alleles.) \n \n ==Genotype frequencies== \n {{main|Allele frequency}} \n The frequency of alleles in a diploid population can be used to predict the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes (see [[Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle]]). For a simple model, with two alleles; \n \n :  < math > p + q=1 \\,  < /math > \n \n :  < math > p^2 + 2pq + q^2=1 \\, < /math > \n \n where ''p'' is the frequency of one allele and ''q'' is the frequency of the alternative allele, which necessarily sum to unity. Then, ''p'' < sup > 2 < /sup >  is the fraction of the population homozygous for the first allele, 2''pq'' is the fraction of heterozygotes, and ''q'' < sup > 2 < /sup >  is the fraction homozygous for the alternative allele. If the first allele is dominant to the second then the fraction of the population that will show the dominant phenotype is ''p'' < sup > 2 < /sup >  + 2''pq'', and the fraction with the recessive phenotype is ''q'' < sup > 2 < /sup > . \n \n With three alleles: \n \n :  < math > p + q + r = 1 \\,  < /math >  and \n \n :  < math > p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2pq + 2pr + 2qr = 1. \\, < /math > \n \n In the case of multiple alleles at a diploid locus, the number of possible genotypes (G) with a number of alleles (a) is given by the expression: \n \n :  < math > G= \\frac{a(a+1)}{2}.  < /math > \n \n ==Allelic dominance in genetic disorders== \n A number of [[genetic disorders]] are caused when an individual inherits two recessive alleles for a single-gene trait. Recessive genetic disorders include [[albinism]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[galactosemia]], [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU), and [[Tay\u2013Sachs disease]]. Other disorders are also due to recessive alleles, but because the gene locus is located on the X chromosome, so that males have only one copy (that is, they are [[hemizygosity|hemizygous]]), they are more frequent in males than in females. Examples include red-green [[color blindness]] and [[fragile X syndrome]]. \n \n Other disorders, such as [[Huntington's disease]], occur when an individual inherits only one dominant allele. \n \n ==Epialleles== \n While [[heredity|heritable traits]] are typically studied in terms of genetic alleles, [[epigenetic]] marks such as [[DNA methylation]] can be inherited at specific genomic regions in certain species, a process termed [[transgenerational epigenetic inheritance]]. The term ''epiallele'' is used to distinguish these heritable marks from traditional alleles, which are defined by [[nucleotide sequence]]. < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Daxinger|first1=Lucia|last2=Whitelaw|first2=Emma|title=Understanding transgenerational epigenetic inheritance via the gametes in mammals|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=31 January 2012|volume=13|issue=3|pages=153\u201362|doi=10.1038/nrg3188|pmid=22290458}} < /ref >  A specific class of epiallele, the [[metastable epiallele]]s, has been discovered in mice and in humans which is characterized by stochastic (probabilistic) establishment of epigenetic state that can be mitotically inherited. < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Rakyan|first1=Vardhman K|last2=Blewitt|first2=Marnie E|last3=Druker|first3=Riki|last4=Preis|first4=Jost I|last5=Whitelaw|first5=Emma|title=Metastable epialleles in mammals|journal=Trends in Genetics|date=July 2002|volume=18|issue=7|pages=348\u2013351|doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(02)02709-9|pmid=12127774}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Waterland|first1=RA|last2=Dolinoy|first2=DC|last3=Lin|first3=JR|last4=Smith|first4=CA|last5=Shi|first5=X|last6=Tahiliani|first6=KG|title=Maternal methyl supplements increase offspring DNA methylation at Axin Fused.|journal=Genesis|date=September 2006|volume=44|issue=9|pages=401\u20136|pmid=16868943|doi=10.1002/dvg.20230}} < /ref > \n \n ==See also== \n {{Portal|Evolutionary biology}} \n {{Columns-list|colwidth=22em| \n * [[Allozyme]] \n * [[Evolution]] \n * [[Genealogical DNA test]] \n * [[Haploinsufficiency]] \n * [[Meiosis]] \n * [[Mendelian error]] \n * [[Mendelian inheritance]] \n * [[Mitosis]] \n * [[Penetrance]] \n * [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphism]] \n * [[Punnett square]] \n * [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism]] \n }} \n \n ==References and notes== \n {{Reflist|refs= < ref name= \" OnlineMendelianInheritanceinMan \" > {{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=110300 |title=ABO Glycosyltransferase; ABO |author1=Victor A.
