It represents a [[bird-of-paradise]], and its name means  \" without feet \"  in [[Greek language|Greek]] because the bird-of-paradise was once wrongly believed to lack feet. First depicted on a celestial globe by [[Petrus Plancius]] in 1598, it was charted on a star atlas by [[Johann Bayer]] in his 1603 ''[[Uranometria]]''. The French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] charted and gave the brighter stars their [[Bayer designation]]s in 1756. \n \n The five brightest stars are all reddish in hue. Shading the others at [[apparent magnitude]] 3.8 is [[Alpha Apodis]], an orange giant that has around 48 times the diameter and 928 times the [[luminosity]] of the Sun. Marginally fainter is [[Gamma Apodis]], another ageing giant star. [[Delta Apodis]] is a [[double star]], the two components of which are 103 [[Minute and second of arc|arcseconds]] apart and visible with the naked eye. Two star systems have been found to have [[exoplanet|planets]]. \n \n ==History== \n {{See also|Dutch celestial cartography in the Age of Discovery|Dutch systematic mapping of the far southern sky}} \n [[File:BayerUran1661apuschamtri.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Detail of [[Johann Bayer]]'s 1603 ''[[Uranometria]]'', showing the constellations Apus, Chamaeleon, Musca (as  \" Apis \" , the Bee), and Triangulum Australe, as well as the South celestial pole.|alt=A black line drawing on faded brownish paper depicting a stylized bird with no feet and a triangle superimposed on some stars]] \n \n Apus was one of twelve constellations published by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the ''[[First Dutch Expedition to Indonesia|Eerste Schipvaart]]'', to the [[East Indies]].
