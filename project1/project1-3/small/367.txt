All Souls' Day is often celebrated in [[Western Christianity]]; [[Saturday of Souls]] is a related tradition more frequently observed in [[Eastern Christianity]]. Practitioners of All Souls' Day traditions often remember deceased loved ones in various ways on the day.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=42}}{{sfn|Ball|2003|p=33|ps=: All Souls' Day: The annual commemoration of all the faithful departed, 2 November.}} Beliefs and practices associated with All Souls' Day vary widely among Christian denominations. \n \n The annual celebration is the last day of [[Allhallowtide]], after [[All Saints' Day]] and its eve.{{sfn|Bannatyne|1998|p=12}} Prior to the standardization of Catholic observance on 2 November by St. Odlio of Cluny during the 10th century, many Catholic congregations celebrated All Souls Day on various dates during the Easter season as it is still observed in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Churches]] and associated [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. Churches of the [[East Syriac Rite]] ([[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Ancient Church of the East]]) commemorate all the faithful departed on the Friday before [[Great Lent|Lent]]. \n \n == Popular customs == \n Many All Souls' Day traditions are associated with popular notions about [[purgatory]]. Bell tolling is meant to comfort those being cleansed. Lighting candles serves to kindle a light for the poor souls languishing in the darkness. [[Soul cakes]] are given to children coming to sing or pray for the dead (cf. [[trick-or-treating]]), giving rise to the traditions of  \" going souling \"  and the baking of special types of bread or cakes (cf. [[P\u00e3o-por-Deus]]).{{sfn|Schousboe|2012|pp=10-13}} \n \n ===Europe=== \n In [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]], cakes are left for them on the table and the room kept warm for their comfort. In [[Brittany]], people flock to the cemeteries at nightfall to kneel, bareheaded, at the graves of their loved ones, and to anoint the hollow of the [[tomb stone|tombstone]] with [[holy water]] or to pour libations of milk on it. At bedtime, the supper is left on the table for the souls.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} \n \n In [[Malta]], on All Souls' Day (known in [[Maltese language|Maltese]] as ''Jum il-Mejtin''), a traditional supper includes roasted pig, based on a custom of letting a pig loose on the streets with a bell around its neck, to be fed by the entire neighborhood and cooked on that day to feed the poor. < ref name=ToM / > \n \n In [[Linz]], funereal musical pieces known as [[aequale]]s were played from tower tops on All Souls' Day and the evening before. < ref name=triton / > \n ===Philippines=== \n {{Main|All Saints' Day#Philippines}} \n In the Philippines, Hallow mas is variously called  \" ''Und\u00e1s'' \" ,  \" ''Todos los Santos'' \"  (Spanish,  \" All Saints \" ), and sometimes  \" ''Araw ng mga Patay / Yumao'' \"  ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]],  \" Day of the dead / those who have passed away \" ), which incorporates All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day. Filipinos traditionally observe this day by visiting the family dead to clean and repair their tombs. Offerings of prayers, flowers, candles, < ref name= \" guardian-world-saints \"  / >  and food. [[Chinese Filipinos]] additionally burn [[joss stick|incense]] and ''[[joss paper|kim]]''. Many also spend the day and ensuing night holding reunions at the cemetery with feasts and merriment. \n \n == Religious observance by denomination == \n ===Byzantine (Greek) Catholic and Eastern Orthodox=== \n {{Main|Saturday of Souls}} \n \n [[File:Soul Saturday Kollyva offerings.jpg|right|thumb|Kollyva offerings of boiled wheat blessed liturgically on Soul Saturday (''Psychosabbaton'').]] \n [[Saturday of Souls]] (or Soul Saturday) is a day set aside for the commemoration of the dead within the [[liturgical year]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and Byzantine Catholic Churches. Saturday is a traditional day of prayer for the dead, because Christ lay dead in the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb]] on Saturday. < ref name= \" GOArch \" > {{cite web |title=Saints and Feasts: Saturday of Souls |url=https://www.goarch.org/chapel/saints?contentid=1017 & PCode=MEATSA & DT=02/22/2020 |website=www.goarch.org |publisher=Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America |access-date=6 November 2020}} < /ref > \n \n These days are devoted to prayer for departed relatives and others among the faithful who would not be commemorated specifically as saints. The [[Divine Services]] on these days have special hymns added to them to commemorate the departed. There is oftena [[Panikhida]] (Memorial Service) either after the [[Divine Liturgy]] on Saturday morning or after [[Vespers]] on Friday evening, for which [[Koliva]] (a dish made of boiled wheatberries or rice and honey) is prepared and placed on the Panikhida table. After the Service, the priest blesses the Koliva. It is then eaten as a memorial by all present. < ref name= \" orthodoxpath \" > {{cite web |author=Panteleimon of Antinoes |title=Saturday of the Souls |url=https://www.orthodoxpath.org/catechisms-and-articles/saturday-of-the-souls/ |website=The Orthodox Path |access-date=6 November 2020 |date=9 March 2013}} < /ref > \n \n ====Radonitsa==== \n {{Main|Radonitsa}} \n Another Memorial Day in the East, Radonitsa, does not fall on a Saturday, but on either Monday or Tuesday of the second week after Pascha (Easter). < ref name= \" Averky \" > {{cite web |title=The Liturgics of Archbishop Averky |url=http://www.holytrinitymission.org/books/english/liturgics_averky_e.htm#_Toc104768210 |website=www.holytrinitymission.org |access-date=6 November 2020}} < /ref > < ref name= \" Bulgakov Handbook \" > S.

Instead a Panikhida will follow the Divine Liturgy, and then all will bring paschal foods to the cemeteries to greet the departed with the joy of the Resurrection. < ref name= \" Averky \" / > \n \n ===East Syriac tradition=== \n East Syriac churches including the [[Syro Malabar Church]] and [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] commemorates the feast of departed faithful on the last Friday of [[Epiphany season]] (which means Friday just before start of [[Great Lent]]). < ref name=nasranifoundation.org / >  The season of Epiphany remembers the revelation of Christ to the world. Each Friday of Epiphany season, the church remembers important evangelistic figures. < ref name=syromalabarchurch.in / > \n \n In the [[Syro Malabar Church]], the Friday before the parish festival is also celebrated as feast of departed faithful when the parish remembers the activities of forebearers who worked for the parish and faithful. They also request the intercession of all departed souls for the faithful celebration of parish festival. In East Syriac liturgy, the church remembers departed souls including saints on every Friday throughout the year since the Christ was crucified and died on Friday. \n \n ===Western Catholicism=== \n [[File:Jakub Schikaneder - All Souls' Day.jpg|thumbnail|''All Souls' Day'', painting by [[Jakub Schikaneder]], 1888]] \n \n ====Background==== \n In the [[Catholic Church]], [[Faithful (baptized Catholic)| \" the faithful \" ]] refers specifically to baptized Catholics;  \" all souls \"  commemorates the [[church penitent]] of souls in [[purgatory]], whereas  \" all saints \"  commemorates the [[church triumphant]] of [[saint]]s in Heaven. In the [[liturgical]] books of the western [[Catholic Church]] (the [[Latin Church]]) it is called the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed ({{lang-la|links=yes|Commemoratio omnium fidelium defunctorum}}), and is celebrated annually on 2 November. In the ordinary form of the Roman Rite, as well as in the [[Personal Ordinariates]] established by [[Benedict XVI]] for former Anglicans, it remains on 2 November if this date falls on a Sunday; < ref > ''Roman Missal'',  \" The Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed \" , and  \" Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar \" , 59 < /ref > < ref > ''Divine Worship: The Missal'',  \" Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed (All Souls) \" , p.871 < /ref >  in the 1962\u20131969 form of the [[Roman Rite]], use of which is still authorized, it is transferred to Monday, 3 November. < ref > ''Missale Romanum'' 1962, ''Rubric\u00e6 generales'',  \" De dierum liturgicorum occurentia accidentali eorumque translatione \" , 96b < /ref >  On this day in particular, Catholics [[pray for the dead]].{{sfn|Bregman|2010|p=45}} Every priest is allowed to celebrate three holy masses on All Souls' Day.  \n The Catholic Church teaches that the purification of the souls in purgatory can be assisted by the actions of the faithful on earth. Its teaching is based also on the practice of prayer for the dead mentioned as far back as 2 Maccabees 12:42\u201346. < ref name=CCC / >  In the West there is ample evidence of the custom of praying for the dead in the inscriptions of the [[catacomb]]s, with their constant prayers for the peace of the souls of the departed and in the early liturgies, which commonly contain commemorations of the dead. Tertullian, Cyprian and other early Western Fathers witness to the regular practice of praying for the dead among the early Christians.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=459}} The theological basis for the feast is the doctrine that the souls which, on departing from the body, are not perfectly cleansed from venial sins, or have not fully atoned for past transgressions, are debarred from the Beatific Vision, and that the faithful on earth can help them by prayers, alms deeds and especially by the sacrifice of the Mass.{{sfn|Mershman|1907}} \n \n ====History==== \n In the sixth century, it was customary in Benedictine monasteries to hold a commemoration of the deceased members at Whitsuntide. In the time of [[St. Isidore of Seville]] (d. 636) who lived in what is today Spain, the Monday after Pentecost was designated to remember the deceased. At the beginning of the ninth century, Abbot [[Eigil of Fulda]] set 17 December as commemoration of all deceased in part of what is today Germany.{{sfn|MacDonald|1967|p=119}} \n \n According to [[Widukind of Corvey]] (c. 975), there also existed a ceremony praying for the dead on 1 October in Saxony.{{sfn|Mershman|1907}} But it was the day after [[All Saints' Day]] that Saint [[Odilo of Cluny]] chose when in the 11th century he instituted for all the monasteries dependent on the [[Abbey of Cluny]] an annual commemoration of all the faithful departed, to be observed with alms, prayers, and sacrifices for the relief of the suffering souls in purgatory.{{sfn|Butler|1990|p=12}} Odilo decreed that those requesting a Mass be offered for the departed should make an offering for the poor, thus linking almsgiving with fasting and prayer for the dead. \n \n The 2 November date and customs spread from the Cluniac monasteries to other Benedictine monasteries and thence to the Western Church in general.{{sfn|McNamara|2013}} The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Li\u00e8ge|Diocese of Li\u00e8ge]] was the first diocese to adopt the practice under [[Notker of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop Notger]] (d. 1008).{{sfn|Mershman|1907}} 2 November was adopted in Italy and Rome in the thirteenth century.{{sfn|MacDonald|1967|p=119}} \n \n In the 15th century the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s instituted a custom of each priest offering three Masses on the Feast of All Souls. During World War I, given the great number of war dead and the many destroyed churches where mass could no longer be said, [[Pope Benedict XV]], granted all priests the privilege of offering three Masses on All Souls Day,{{sfn|Saunders|2003}} a permission that still stands. \n \n ====Liturgical practice==== \n In the Roman Rite as revised in 1969, if 2 November falls on a Sunday, the Mass is of All Souls, but the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] is that of the Sunday. However, public celebration of Lauds and Vespers of the Dead with the people participating is permitted. While celebration of a Sunday, a solemnity or a feast of the Lord replacing a Sunday begins on the previous evening with Vespers and perhaps evening Mass, the general norms do not allow for anticipation on Saturday evening of the liturgy of All Souls' Day falling on a Sunday, and so they suggest that the formula of the Mass on that Saturday evening is that of the solemnity of All Saints, which outranks the Sunday of Ordinary Time whose Mass would be celebrated on that evening.{{sfn|McNamara|2013}} < ref > Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar,  \" Table of Liturgical Days \" ] < /ref >  However, in 2014, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops decided that for that year the Saturday evening (Sunday vigil) Mass in that country was to be that of All Souls; in countries such as Italy the situation was less clear.{{sfn|McNamara|2014}} \n \n In countries where All Saints' Day is not a [[holy day of obligation]] attendance at an evening Mass of All Saints on Saturday 1 November satisfies the Sunday obligation.{{sfn|McNamara|2013}} In England and Wales, where holy days of obligation that fall on a Saturday are transferred to the following day, if 2 November is a Sunday, the solemnity of All Saints is transferred to that date, and All Souls Day is transferred to 3 November.{{sfn|McNamara|2014}} In pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite, still observed by some, if All Souls Day falls on a Sunday, it is always transferred to 3 November. \n \n In [[Divine Worship: The Missal]] the minor propers (Introit, Gradual, Tract, Sequence, Offertory, and Communion) are those used for Renaissance and Classical musical [[requiem]] settings, including the [[Dies Irae]].  This permits the performance of traditional requiem settings in the context of the Divine Worship Form of the Roman Rite on All Souls Day as well as at funerals, votive celebrations of all faithful departed, and anniversaries of deaths. < ref > ''Divine Worship: The Missal'', pp.871\u2013875  &  pp.1024\u20131032 < /ref > \n \n ====All Souls' indulgence==== \n According to The Enchiridion of Indulgences,  \n An indulgence, applicable only to the souls in purgatory (commonly called the poor souls), is granted to the faithful, who devoutly visit a cemetery and pray for the departed. The indulgence is plenary, under the usual conditions, each day from the first to the eighth of November; a partial indulgence is granted on any other days of the year. < ref name=catholic.org / > \n \" A plenary indulgence, applicable ONLY to the souls in purgatory, may be obtained by those who, on All Souls Day, piously visit a church, public oratory, or - for those entitled to use it, a semi public oratory. It may be acquired either on the day designated as All Souls Day or, with the consent of the bishop, on the preceding or following Sunday or the feast of All Saints. On visiting the church or oratory it is required that one Our Father and the Creed be recited. \" < ref name=EnchIndul / > < ref name=catholic.org / > \n \n ===Lutheran Churches=== \n [[File:Alla helgons dag vid R\u00f6ke kyrka-1.jpg|A [[churchyard|graveyard]] outside a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church in the Swedish city of [[R\u00f6ke]] during Allhallowtide|250px|thumb|right]] \n Among continental [[Protestantism|Protestants]] its tradition has been more tenaciously maintained. During [[Martin Luther (religious leader)|Luther's]] lifetime, All Souls' Day was widely observed in [[Saxony]] although the Roman Catholic meaning of the day was discarded;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} ecclesiastically in the [[Lutheran Church]], the day was merged with, and is often seen as an extension of All Saints' Day, with many Lutherans still visiting and decorating graves on all the days of Allhallowtide, including All Souls' Day.{{sfn|Markussen|2013|p=183}} Just as it is the custom of [[French people]], of all ranks and creeds, to decorate the graves of their dead on the ''jour des morts'', so [[German people|German]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] people stream to the graveyards once a year with offerings of flowers and special grave lights. Among [[Czech people]] the custom of visiting and tidying graves of relatives on the day is quite common. In 1816, [[Prussia]] introduced a new date for the remembrance of the Dead among its Lutheran citizens: [[Totensonntag]], the last Sunday before [[Advent]]. This custom was later also adopted by the non-Prussian Lutherans in Germany, but it has not spread much beyond the Protestant areas of Germany. \n \n ===Anglican Communion=== \n [[File:Leichhardt All Souls Anglican Church.JPG|right|thumb|[[All Souls Anglican Church, Leichhardt|All Souls Anglican Church]] in the [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney|Diocese of Sydney]], a parish dedicated to All Souls]] \n \n In the [[Church of England]] it is called The Commemoration of the Faithful Departed and is an optional celebration; Anglicans view All Souls' Day as an extension of the observance of All Saints' Day and it serves to  \" remember those who have died \" , in connection with the theological doctrines of the [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrection of the body]] and the [[Communion of Saints]].{{sfn|Bays|Hancock|2012|p=128}}{{sfn|Armentrout|Slocum|1999|p=7}} \n \n In the [[Anglican Communion]], All Souls' Day is known liturgically as the Commemoration of All Faithful Departed, and is an optional observance seen as  \" an extension of All Saints' Day \" , the latter of which marks the second day of [[Allhallowtide]].{{sfn|Armentrout|Slocum|1999|p=7}}{{sfn|Dickison|2014}} Historically and at present, several Anglican churches are dedicated to All Souls. During the [[English Reformation]], the observance of All Souls' Day lapsed, although a new Anglican theological understanding of the day has  \" led to a widespread acceptance of this commemoration among Anglicans \" .{{sfn|Michno|1998|p=160}} Patricia Bays, with regard to the Anglican view of All Souls' Day, wrote that:{{sfn|Bays|Hancock|2012|p=128}} \n \n {{quote|All Souls Day (November 2) is a time when we particularly remember those who have died.
