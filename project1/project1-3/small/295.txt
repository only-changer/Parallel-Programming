He concluded the [[Treaty of Perth]], by which Scotland acquired sovereignty over the [[Western Isles]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. His heir, [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]], died before she could be crowned. \n \n ==Life== \n Alexander was born at [[Roxburgh]], the only son of [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] by his second wife [[Marie de Coucy]]. < ref > {{cite web |title=Alexander III (1241\u20131286), king of Scots |url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-323 |website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |access-date=9 June 2020 |language=en |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/323}} < /ref >  Alexander's father died on 8 July 1249 and he became king at the age of seven, inaugurated at [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] on 13 July 1249. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Panton |first1=James |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Monarchy |date=2011 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-7497-8 |page=538 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BiyyueBTpaMC & pg=PA538 |language=en}} < /ref > \n \n The years of his minority featured an embittered struggle for the control of affairs between two rival parties, the one led by [[Walter Comyn]], [[Earl of Menteith]], the other by [[Alan Durward]], [[Justiciar of Scotia]]. The former dominated  the early years of Alexander's reign. At the marriage of Alexander to [[Margaret of England]] in 1251, [[Henry III of England]] seized the opportunity to demand from his son-in-law homage for the Scottish kingdom, but Alexander did not comply. In 1255 an interview between the English and Scottish kings at [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]] led to Menteith and his party losing to Durward's party. But though disgraced, they still retained great influence, and two years later, seizing the person of the king, they compelled their rivals to consent to the erection of a regency representative of both parties. < ref name=bbc > [https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/alexander_iii/  \" Alexander III, King of Scots 1249 \u2013 1286 \" , Scotland's History, BBC] < /ref > \n \n On attaining his majority at the age of 21 in 1262, Alexander declared his intention of resuming the projects on the [[Western Isles]] which the death of his father thirteen years before had cut short. < ref name=bbc/ >  He laid a formal claim before the [[Norway|Norwegian]] king [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon]].  Haakon rejected the claim, and in the following year responded with a formidable invasion. Sailing around the west coast of Scotland he halted off the [[Isle of Arran]], and negotiations commenced. Alexander artfully prolonged the talks until the autumn storms should begin. At length Haakon, weary of delay, attacked, only to encounter a terrific [[extreme weather|storm]] which greatly damaged his ships. The [[Battle of Largs]] (October 1263) proved indecisive, but even so, Haakon's position was hopeless. Baffled, he turned homewards, but died in Orkney on 15 December 1263. The Isles now lay at Alexander's feet, and in 1266 Haakon's successor concluded the [[Treaty of Perth]] by which he ceded the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Western Isles]] to Scotland in return for a monetary payment. Norway retained [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] until 1469 when they became a dowry for [[James III of Scotland|James III]]'s bride, [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret of Denmark]]. \n \n ==Succession== \n \n Alexander had married [[Margaret of England|Margaret]], daughter of King [[Henry III of England]] and [[Eleanor of Provence]], on 25 December 1251, when he was ten years old and she was eleven. < ref name= \" MacArthur2017 \" > {{cite book|author=Margaret MacArthur|title=History of Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5c8sDwAAQBAJ & pg=PT25|date=12 July 2017|publisher=Merkaba Press via PublishDrive|pages=25\u2013|id=PKEY:6610000020409}} < /ref >  She died in 1275, after they had had three children. < ref > {{Cite book|last=Ashley|first=Mike|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1OqdBAAAQBAJ & q=margaret+She+died+in+1275%2C+after+they+had+had+three+children. & pg=PT21|title=The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens|date=2012-06-07|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-1-4721-0113-6|language=en}} < /ref > \n # [[Margaret of Scotland (Queen of Norway)|Margaret]] (28 February 1261 \u2013 9 April 1283), who married King [[Eric II of Norway]] < ref name=bbc/ > \n # [[Alexander, Prince of Scotland]] (21 January 1264 [[Jedburgh]] \u2013 28 January 1284 [[Lindores Abbey]]); buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]] \n # David (20 March 1272 \u2013 June 1281 [[Stirling Castle]]); buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]] \n \n According to the [[Lanercost Chronicle]], Alexander did not spend his decade as a widower alone:  \" he used never to forbear on account of season nor storm, nor for perils of flood or rocky cliffs, but would visit none too creditably nuns or matrons, virgins or widows as the fancy seized him, sometimes in disguise. \" < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Maxwell|first1=Herbert, ed.|title=Chronicle of Lanercost|journal=The Scottish Historical Review|date=1909|volume=6|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBNAAQAAMAAJ & q=he+used+never+to+forbear+on+account+of+season+nor+storm%2C+nor+for+perils+of+flood+or+rocky+cliffs%2C+but+would+visit+none+too+creditably+nuns+or+matrons%2C+virgins+or+widows+as+the+fancy+seized+him%2C+sometimes+in+disguise & pg=PA184|access-date=8 Aug 2016}} < /ref > \n \n Towards the end of Alexander's reign, the death of all three of his children within a few years made the question of the succession one of pressing importance.

When Yolande's pregnancy ended, probably with a miscarriage, Alexander's three-year-old granddaughter [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]], became the heir.

Doherty]]. A [[crime fiction]] novel where Hugh Corbett investigates the  \" mysterious death \"  of Alexander III (1286). Alexander supposedly suffered a fatal fall from his horse. But there are suspicions of murder. The novel concludes that Alexander was indeed murdered  \" by a fanatical servant \"  of [[Edward I of England]]. The killer acting according to  \" Edward's secret desire to overwhelm and control Scotland \" .

This was, in tradition, an omen of death. \n *''Crusader'' (1991) by [[Nigel Tranter]]. This novel follows the minority of Alexander III and his relationship with David de Lindsay. Tranter, who has written scores of historical novels spanning the range of Scotland's history, also wrote  \" Envoy Extraordinary \"  (1999) (about Patrick Earl of Dunbar) and  \" True Thomas \"  (1981) (about Thomas the Rhymer), both of which take place during the reign of Alexander III, and in which Alexander is a featured character. \n \n ==Ancestry== \n {{ahnentafel \n |collapsed=yes |align=center \n |boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc; \n |boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9; \n |boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc; \n |boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc; \n |boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe; \n |1= 1.
