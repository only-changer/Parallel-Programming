The article follows [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (chemistry)#Element names]] for conventions on chemical names, so  \" sulfur \" , etc. should be maintained.-- > \n {{Infobox aluminium}} \n '''Aluminium''' ('''aluminum''' in [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]]) is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] & nbsp;'''Al''' and [[atomic number]] & nbsp;13. Aluminium has a density lower than those of other common [[Metal|metals]], at approximately one third that of [[steel]]. It has a great affinity towards [[oxygen]], and [[Passivation (chemistry)|forms a protective layer]] of [[Aluminium oxide|oxide]] on the surface when exposed to air. Aluminium visually resembles silver, both in its color and in its great ability to reflect light. It is soft, [[Magnetism|non-magnetic]] and [[ductility|ductile]]. It has one stable isotope,  < sup > 27 < /sup > Al; this isotope is very common, making aluminium the twelfth most common element in the Universe. The radioactivity of [[Aluminum-26| < sup > 26 < /sup > Al]] is used in [[Radiometric dating|radiodating]]. \n \n Chemically, aluminium is a weak metal in the [[boron group]]; as it is common for the group, aluminium forms compounds primarily in the +3 [[oxidation state]]. The aluminium [[cation]] Al < sup > 3+ < /sup >  is small and highly charged; as such, it is polarizing, and [[Chemical bond|bonds]] aluminium forms tend towards [[Covalent bond|covalency]]. The strong affinity towards oxygen leads to aluminium's common association with oxygen in nature in the form of oxides; for this reason, aluminium is found on Earth primarily in rocks in the [[Earth's crust|crust]], where it is the third most abundant element after [[oxygen]] and [[silicon]], rather than in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], and virtually never as the free metal. \n \n The discovery of aluminium was announced in 1825 by Danish physicist [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]]. The first industrial production of aluminium was initiated by French chemist [[Henri \u00c9tienne Sainte-Claire Deville]] in 1856. Aluminium became much more available to the public with the [[Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process]] developed independently by French engineer [[Paul H\u00e9roult]] and American engineer [[Charles Martin Hall]] in 1886, and the mass production of aluminium led to its extensive use in industry and everyday life. In World Wars [[World War I|I]] and [[World War II|II]], aluminium was a crucial [[strategic resource]] for [[aviation]]. In 1954, aluminium became the most produced [[non-ferrous metal]], surpassing [[copper]]. In the 21st century, most aluminium was consumed in transportation, engineering, construction, and packaging in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan. \n \n Despite its prevalence in the environment, no living organism is known to use aluminium [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] [[metabolically]], but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals. Because of the abundance of these salts, the potential for a biological role for them is of continuing interest, and studies continue. \n \n == Physical characteristics == \n === Isotopes === \n {{Main|Isotopes of aluminium}} \n \n Of aluminium isotopes, only {{SimpleNuclide|Aluminium}} is stable. This situation is common for elements with an odd atomic number.{{efn|No elements with odd atomic numbers have more than two stable isotopes; even-numbered elements have multiple stable isotopes, with tin (element 50) having the highest number of stable isotopes of all elements, ten. The single exception is [[beryllium]] which is even-numbered but has only one stable isotope. < ref name=IAEA/ >  See [[Even and odd atomic nuclei]] for more details.}} It is the only [[primordial nuclide|primordial]] aluminium isotope, i.e. the only one that has existed on Earth in its current form since the formation of the planet. Nearly all aluminium on Earth is present as this isotope, which makes it a [[mononuclidic element]] and means that its [[standard atomic weight]] is virtually the same as that of the isotope. This makes aluminium very useful in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), as its single stable isotope has a high NMR sensitivity.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1997|pp=242\u2013252}} The standard atomic weight of aluminium is low in comparison with many other metals,{{efn|Most other metals have greater standard atomic weights: for instance, that of iron is 55.8; copper 63.5; lead 207.2. < ref name= \" CIAAW2013 \" / > < !-- defined by Template:Infobox Aluminum -- > }} which has consequences for the element's properties (see [[#Bulk|below]]). \n \n All other isotopes of aluminium are [[radioactive decay|radioactive]]. The most stable of these is [[Aluminium-26| < sup > 26 < /sup > Al]]: while it was present along with stable  < sup > 27 < /sup > Al in the interstellar medium from which the Solar System formed, having been produced by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] as well, its [[half-life]] is only 717,000 & nbsp;years and therefore a detectable amount has not survived since the formation of the planet. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://ciaaw.org/aluminium.htm |title=Aluminium |publisher=The Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights |access-date=2020-10-20}} < /ref >  However, minute traces of  < sup > 26 < /sup > Al are produced from [[argon]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] by [[spallation]] caused by [[cosmic ray]] protons.
