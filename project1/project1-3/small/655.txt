Apollo{{nbsp}}8 was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the [[Saturn V]] rocket, and was the first human spaceflight from the [[Kennedy Space Center]], located adjacent to [[Cape Canaveral Space Force Station|Cape Kennedy Air Force Station]] in Florida. \n \n Originally planned as the second crewed [[Apollo Lunar Module]] and [[Apollo command and service module|command module]] test, to be flown in an elliptical [[medium Earth orbit]] in early 1969, the mission profile was changed in August 1968 to a more ambitious command-module-only lunar orbital flight to be flown in December, as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight. Astronaut [[Jim McDivitt]]'s crew, who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low Earth orbit, became the crew for the [[Apollo 9|Apollo{{nbsp}}9]] mission, and Borman's crew were moved to the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 mission. This left Borman's crew with two to three months' less training and preparation time than originally planned, and replaced the planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training. \n \n Apollo 8 took 68 hours (almost three days) to travel the distance to the Moon. The crew orbited the Moon ten times over the course of twenty hours, during which they made a Christmas Eve [[Apollo TV camera|television broadcast]] in which they [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|read the first ten verses from]] the [[Book of Genesis]]. At the time, the broadcast was the most watched TV program ever. Apollo{{nbsp}}8's successful mission paved the way for [[Apollo 11|Apollo{{nbsp}}11]] to fulfill U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s. The Apollo{{nbsp}}8 astronauts returned to Earth on December 27, 1968, when their spacecraft splashed down in the northern Pacific Ocean. The crew members were named [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]'s [[Time Person of the Year| \" Men of the Year \" ]] for 1968 upon their return. \n \n ==Background== \n \n In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United States was engaged in the [[Cold War]], a geopolitical rivalry with the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Logsdon|1976|p=134}} On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched [[Sputnik 1]], the first [[Satellite|artificial satellite]]. This unexpected success stoked fears and imaginations around the world. It not only demonstrated that the Soviet Union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances, it challenged American claims of military, economic, and technological superiority.{{sfn|Logsdon|1976|pp=13\u201315}} The launch precipitated the [[Sputnik crisis]] and triggered the [[Space Race]].{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=1}} \n \n [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] believed that not only was it in the national interest of the United States to be superior to other nations, but that the perception of American power was at least as important as the actuality. It was therefore intolerable to him for the Soviet Union to be more advanced in the field of space exploration. He was determined that the United States should compete, and sought a challenge that maximized its chances of winning.{{sfn|Logsdon|1976|p=134}} \n \n The Soviet Union had heavier-lifting [[carrier rocket]]s, which meant Kennedy needed to choose a goal that was beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry, one where the US and Soviet Union would be starting from a position of equality\u2014something spectacular, even if it could not be justified on military, economic, or scientific grounds. After consulting with his experts and advisors, he chose such a project: to land a man on the Moon and return him to the Earth.{{sfn|Logsdon|1976|pp=112\u2013117}} This project already had a name: [[Project Apollo]].{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=15}} \n \n An early and crucial decision was the adoption of [[lunar orbit rendezvous]], under which a specialized spacecraft would land on the lunar surface. The [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo spacecraft]] therefore had three primary components: a [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that would return to Earth; a [[service module]] (SM) to provide the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a two-stage [[lunar module]] (LM), which comprised a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to return the astronauts to lunar orbit.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=72\u201377}} This configuration could be launched by the [[Saturn V]] rocket that was then under development.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=48\u201349}} \n \n ==Framework== \n ===Prime crew=== \n \n {{Spaceflight crew \n |terminology = Astronaut \n |position1   = Commander \n |crew1_up    = [[Frank Borman|Frank F.

Armstrong would later command Apollo{{nbsp}}11, with Aldrin as LMP and Collins as CMP. Haise served on the backup crew of Apollo{{nbsp}}11 as LMP and flew on [[Apollo 13|Apollo{{nbsp}}13]] as LMP.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=33}}{{sfn|Cunningham|2010|p=109}} \n \n ===Support personnel=== \n \n During Projects Mercury and Gemini, each mission had a prime and a backup crew. For Apollo, a third crew of astronauts was added, known as the support crew. The support crew maintained the flight plan, checklists, and mission ground rules, and ensured that the prime and backup crews were apprised of any changes. The support crew developed procedures in the simulators, especially those for emergency situations, so that the prime and backup crews could practice and master them in their simulator training.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=261}} For Apollo{{nbsp}}8, the support crew consisted of [[Ken Mattingly]], [[Vance Brand]], and [[Gerald P. Carr|Gerald Carr]].{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=33}}{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=375}} \n \n The [[capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM) was an astronaut at the [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]], who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew.{{sfn|Kranz|2000|p=27}} For Apollo{{nbsp}}8, the CAPCOMs were Michael Collins, Gerald Carr, Ken Mattingly, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Vance Brand, and Fred Haise.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=33}}{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=375}} \n \n The mission control teams rotated in three shifts, each led by a flight director.

It shows a red figure{{nbsp}}8 looping around the Earth and Moon to reflect both the mission number and the circumlunar nature of the mission. On the bottom of the{{nbsp}}8 are the names of the three astronauts. The initial design of the insignia was developed by Jim Lovell, who reportedly sketched it while riding in the back seat of a [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38]] flight from [[California]] to [[Houston]] shortly after learning of Apollo{{nbsp}}8's re-designation as a lunar-orbital mission.{{sfn|Lattimer|1985|p=53}} \n \n The crew wanted to name their spacecraft, but NASA did not allow it. The crew would have likely chosen ''Columbiad'',{{sfn|Lattimer|1985|p=53}} the name of the giant cannon that launches a space vehicle in [[Jules Verne]]'s 1865 novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]''. The Apollo{{nbsp}}11 CM was named ''Columbia'' in part for that reason.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=334\u2013335}} \n \n ==Preparations== \n ===Mission schedule=== \n \n {{Main|List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|l1=List of Apollo missions}} \n \n On September 20, 1967, NASA adopted a seven-step plan for Apollo missions, with the final step being a Moon landing. [[Apollo 4|Apollo{{nbsp}}4]] and [[Apollo 6|Apollo{{nbsp}}6]] were  \" A \"  missions, tests of the [[Saturn V|Saturn{{nbsp}}V]] launch vehicle using an uncrewed Block I production model of the command and service module (CSM) in Earth orbit. [[Apollo 5|Apollo{{nbsp}}5]] was a  \" B \"  mission, a test of the LM in Earth orbit. Apollo{{nbsp}}7, scheduled for October 1968, would be a  \" C \"  mission, a crewed Earth-orbit flight of the CSM. Further missions depended on the readiness of the LM. It had been decided as early as May 1967 that there would be at least four additional missions. Apollo{{nbsp}}8 was planned as the  \" D \"  mission, a test of the LM in a low Earth orbit in December 1968 by [[James McDivitt]], [[David Scott]], and [[Rusty Schweickart|Russell Schweickart]], while Borman's crew would fly the  \" E \"  mission, a more rigorous LM test in an elliptical medium Earth orbit as Apollo{{nbsp}}9, in early 1969. The  \" F \"  Mission would test the CSM and LM in lunar orbit, and the  \" G \"  mission would be the finale, the Moon landing.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=231\u2013234}} \n [[File:Apollo 8 first stage in the Vehicle Assembly Building.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The first stage of AS-503 being erected in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB) on February 1, 1968]] \n \n Production of the LM fell behind schedule, and when Apollo{{nbsp}}8's LM-3 arrived at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in June 1968, more than a hundred significant defects were discovered, leading [[Bob Gilruth]], the director of the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] (MSC), and others to conclude that there was no prospect of LM-3 being ready to fly in 1968.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=256}} Indeed, it was possible that delivery would slip to February or March 1969. Following the original seven-step plan would have meant delaying the  \" D \"  and subsequent missions, and endangering the program's goal of a lunar landing before the end of 1969.{{sfn|Ertel|Newkirk|Brooks|1978|pp=237\u2013238}} [[George Low]], the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, proposed a solution in August 1968 to keep the program on track despite the LM delay. Since the next CSM (designated as  \" CSM-103 \" ) would be ready three months before LM-3, a CSM-only mission could be flown in December 1968. Instead of repeating the  \" C \"  mission flight of Apollo{{nbsp}}7, this CSM could be sent all the way to the Moon, with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit and returning to Earth. The new mission would also allow NASA to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have had to wait until [[Apollo 10|Apollo{{nbsp}}10]], the scheduled  \" F \"  mission. This also meant that the medium Earth orbit  \" E \"  mission could be dispensed with. The net result was that only the  \" D \"  mission had to be delayed, and the plan for lunar landing in mid-1969 could remain on timeline.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=257}} \n \n On August 9, 1968, Low discussed the idea with Gilruth, Flight Director [[Chris Kraft]], and the Director of Flight Crew Operations, [[Donald Slayton]]. They then flew to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], where they met with KSC Director [[Kurt Debus]], Apollo Program Director [[Samuel C. Phillips]], [[Rocco Petrone]], and [[Wernher von Braun]]. Kraft considered the proposal feasible from a flight control standpoint; Debus and Petrone agreed that the next Saturn V, AS-503, could be made ready by December 1; and von Braun was confident the [[pogo oscillation]] problems that had afflicted Apollo{{nbsp}}6 had been fixed. Almost every senior manager at NASA agreed with this new mission, citing confidence in both the hardware and the personnel, along with the potential for a circumlunar flight providing a significant morale boost. The only person who needed some convincing was [[James E. Webb]], the NASA administrator. Backed by the full support of his agency, Webb authorized the mission. Apollo{{nbsp}}8 was officially changed from a  \" D \"  mission to a  \" C-Prime \"  lunar-orbit mission.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=257\u2013260}} \n \n With the change in mission for Apollo 8, Slayton asked McDivitt if he still wanted to fly it. McDivitt turned it down; his crew had spent a great deal of time preparing to test the LM, and that was what he still wanted to do. Slayton then decided to swap the prime and backup crews of the D{{nbsp}}and E{{nbsp}}missions. This swap also meant a swap of spacecraft, requiring Borman's crew to use CSM-103, while McDivitt's crew would use CSM-104, since CM-104 could not be made ready by December. David Scott was not happy about giving up CM-103, the testing of which he had closely supervised, for CM-104, although the two were almost identical, and Anders was less than enthusiastic about being an LMP on a flight with no LM.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=262}}{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=296\u2013298}} Instead, in order that the spacecraft would have the correct weight and balance, Apollo{{nbsp}}8 would carry {{notatypo|a}} < !--LM is pronounced  \" LEM \" -- >  LM test article, a boilerplate model of LM-3.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=257\u2013260}} \n \n Added pressure on the Apollo program to make its 1969 landing goal was provided by the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Zond 5|Zond{{nbsp}}5]] mission, which flew some living creatures, including [[Russian tortoise]]s, in a [[cislunar]] loop around the Moon and returned them to Earth on September 21.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=76}} There was speculation within NASA and the press that they might be preparing to launch [[astronaut#Russian|cosmonauts]] on a similar [[Zond program#Circumlunar missions|circumlunar mission]] before the end of 1968. < ref name= \" Moon Race 1968 \" > {{cite magazine |title=Poised for the Leap |url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,844661-1,00.html |access-date=December 15, 2011 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 6, 1968 }} < /ref > \n [[File:Mating of Apollo 8 spacecraft with Saturn-V.jpg|thumb|right|Erection and mating of spacecraft 103 to Launch Vehicle AS-503 in the VAB for the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 mission]] \n \n The Apollo 8 crew, now living in the crew quarters at Kennedy Space Center, received a visit from [[Charles Lindbergh]] and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]], the night before the launch. < ref > {{cite news |title=Astronauts look back 30 years after historic lunar launch |first=Richard |last=Benke |url=http://cgi.canoe.ca/SpaceArchive/981221_30.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Augusta Chronicle]] |publisher=[[Morris Communications]] |date=December 21, 1998 |access-date=June 28, 2013}} < /ref >  They talked about how, before his [[Spirit of St. Louis|1927 flight]], Lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from New York City to Paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight. The total he had carried was a tenth of the amount that the Saturn V would burn every second. The next day, the Lindberghs watched the launch of Apollo{{nbsp}}8 from a nearby dune.{{sfn|Kluger|2017|pp=149\u2013151}} \n \n ===Saturn V redesign=== \n \n The Saturn V rocket used by Apollo{{nbsp}}8 was designated AS-503, or the  \" 03rd \"  model of the Saturn{{nbsp}}V ( \" 5 \" ) Rocket to be used in the Apollo-Saturn ( \" AS \" ) program. When it was erected in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] on December 20, 1967, it was thought that the rocket would be used for an uncrewed Earth-orbit test flight carrying a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] command and service module. Apollo{{nbsp}}6 had suffered several major problems during its April 1968 flight, including severe [[pogo oscillation]] during its first stage, two second-stage engine failures, and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit. Without assurances that these problems had been rectified, NASA administrators could not justify risking a crewed mission until additional uncrewed test flights proved the Saturn V was ready.{{sfn|Bilstein|1996|pp=360\u2013370}} \n \n Teams from the MSFC went to work on the problems. Of primary concern was the pogo oscillation, which would not only hamper engine performance, but could exert significant g-forces on a crew. A task force of contractors, NASA agency representatives, and MSFC researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated, causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket. A system that used helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed.{{sfn|Bilstein|1996|pp=360\u2013370}} \n [[File:Ap8-KSC-68PC-147.jpg|thumb|left|Apollo 8 atop Saturn{{nbsp}}V being rolled out to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Pad 39A]]]] \n \n Of equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight. Researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum, causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two. When an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two, it had accidentally shut down engine three's liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection. As a result, engine three failed within one second of engine two's shutdown. Further investigation revealed the same problem for the third-stage engine\u2014a faulty igniter line. The team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits, hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches.{{sfn|Bilstein|1996|pp=360\u2013370}} \n \n The teams tested their solutions in August 1968 at the MSFC. A Saturn stage IC was equipped with shock-absorbing devices to demonstrate the team's solution to the problem of pogo oscillation, while a Saturn Stage II was retrofitted with modified fuel lines to demonstrate their resistance to leaks and ruptures in vacuum conditions. Once NASA administrators were convinced that the problems had been solved, they gave their approval for a crewed mission using AS-503.{{sfn|Bilstein|1996|pp=360\u2013370}} \n \n The Apollo 8 spacecraft was placed on top of the rocket on September 21, and the rocket made the slow {{convert|3|mi|adj=on}} journey to the launch pad on October{{nbsp}}9. < ref name= \" satVillust \" > {{cite book |last=Akens |first=David S. |title=Saturn Illustrated Chronology |url=https://history.nasa.gov/MHR-5/cover.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307132427/https://history.nasa.gov/MHR-5/app_h.htm |archive-date=March 7, 2008 |access-date=February 1, 2008 |year=1971 |publisher=[[Marshall Space Flight Center]] |location=Huntsville, AL |id=MSFC MHR-5 |chapter=Appendix H\u2014Saturn at the Cape |chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/MHR-5/app_h.htm |url-status=live}} < /ref >  Testing continued all through December until the day before launch, including various levels of readiness testing from December{{nbsp}}5 through 11.

Apollo lunar missions would begin with a nominal {{convert|100|nmi|km|sigfig=4|adj=on}} circular Earth parking orbit. Apollo{{nbsp}}8 was launched into an initial orbit with an [[apogee]] of {{convert|99.99|nmi|km}} and a [[perigee]] of {{convert|99.57|nmi|km}}, with an [[inclination]] of 32.51\u00b0 to the [[Equator]], and an [[orbital period]] of 88.19 minutes. Propellant venting increased the apogee by {{convert|6.4|nmi|km}} over the 2{{nbsp}}hours, 44 minutes, and 30 seconds spent in the parking orbit.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=45}} \n \n This was followed by a [[trans-lunar injection]] (TLI) burn of the [[S-IVB]] third stage for 318 seconds, accelerating the {{convert|63650|lb|kg|abbr=on}} command and service module and {{convert|19900|lb|kg|abbr=on}} LM test article from an orbital velocity of {{convert|25567|ft/s|m/s}} to the injection velocity of {{convert|35505|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=46}} < ref name= \" PressKit \" / >  which set a record for the highest speed, relative to Earth, that humans had ever traveled.{{sfn|Phillips|1975|p=178}} This speed was slightly less than the Earth's [[escape velocity]] of {{convert|36747|ft/s|m/s}}, but put Apollo{{nbsp}}8 into an elongated elliptical Earth orbit, close enough to the Moon to be captured by the Moon's gravity.{{sfn|Woods|2008|pp=108\u2013109}} \n \n The standard lunar orbit for Apollo missions was planned as a nominal {{convert|60|nmi|km|adj=on}} circular orbit above the Moon's surface. Initial lunar orbit insertion was an ellipse with a [[perilune]] of {{convert|60.0|nmi|km}} and an [[apolune]] of {{convert|168.5|nmi|km}}, at an inclination of 12\u00b0 from the lunar equator. This was then circularized at {{convert|60.7|nmi|km}} by {{convert|59.7|nmi|km}}, with an orbital period of 128.7 minutes.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=46}} The effect of lunar [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentrations]] ( \" mascons \" ) on the orbit was found to be greater than initially predicted; over the course of the ten lunar orbits lasting twenty hours, the orbital distance was perturbated to {{convert|63.6|nmi|km}} by {{convert|58.6|nmi|km}}.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=39}} \n \n Apollo 8 achieved a maximum distance from Earth of {{convert|203752|nmi|smi km|abbr=off|sp=us}}.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=39}} \n \n ===Launch and trans-lunar injection=== \n \n [[File:Apollo 8 liftoff.jpg|thumb|left|Apollo 8 launch]] \n \n Apollo 8 was launched at 12:51:00 [[UTC]] (07:51:00 [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Standard Time]]) on December 21, 1968, using the Saturn V's [[Multistage rocket|three stages]] to achieve Earth orbit.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=39}} The [[S-IC]] first stage landed in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at {{Coord|30|12|N|74|7|W|name=Apollo 8 S-IC impact}}, and the [[S-II]] second stage landed at {{Coord|31|50|N|37|17|W|name=Apollo 8 S-II impact}}.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=34}} The [[S-IVB]] third stage injected the craft into Earth orbit and remained attached to perform the TLI burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the Moon.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=35}} \n \n Once the [[space vehicle|vehicle]] reached Earth orbit, both the crew and [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Houston flight controllers]] spent the next 2{{nbsp}}hours and 38 minutes checking that the spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for TLI.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=276}} The proper operation of the S-IVB third stage of the rocket was crucial, and in the last uncrewed test, it had failed to reignite for this burn.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=250\u2013252}} Collins was the first CAPCOM on duty, and at 2{{nbsp}}hours, 27 minutes and 22 seconds after launch he radioed,  \" Apollo{{nbsp}}8.

The S-IVB engine ignited on time and performed the TLI burn perfectly.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=276}} Over the next five minutes, the spacecraft's speed increased from {{convert|7600|to|10800|m/s|sp=us}}.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=276}} \n \n After the S-IVB had placed the mission on course for the Moon, the command and service modules (CSM), the remaining Apollo{{nbsp}}8 spacecraft, separated from it. The crew then rotated the spacecraft to take photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it. As the crew rotated the spacecraft, they had their first views of the Earth as they moved away from it\u2014this marked the first time humans had viewed the whole Earth at once. Borman became worried that the S-IVB was staying too close to the CSM and suggested to Mission Control that the crew perform a separation maneuver. Mission Control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards Earth and using the small [[Apollo CSM#Reaction control system|reaction control system]] (RCS) thrusters on the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) to add {{convert|1.1|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on|sp=us}} to their velocity away from the Earth, but Borman did not want to lose sight of the S-IVB. After discussion, the crew and Mission Control decided to burn in the Earth direction to increase speed, but at {{convert|7.7|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} instead. The time needed to prepare and perform the additional burn put the crew an hour behind their onboard tasks.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=35}}{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=276\u2013278}} \n [[File:As8-16-2583.jpg|thumb|Apollo 8 [[S-IVB]] rocket stage shortly after separation]] \n \n Five hours after launch, Mission Control sent a command to the S-IVB to vent its remaining fuel, changing its trajectory.

Although Mission Control normally performed all the actual navigation calculations, it was necessary to have a crew member adept at navigation so that the crew could return to Earth in case communication with Mission Control was lost. Lovell navigated by star sightings using a [[sextant]] built into the spacecraft, measuring the angle between a star and the Earth's (or the Moon's) [[horizon]].

The crew placed the spacecraft into Passive Thermal Control (PTC), also called  \" barbecue roll \" , in which the spacecraft rotated about once per hour around its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft. In direct sunlight, parts of the spacecraft's outer surface could be heated to over {{convert|200|C|F}}, while the parts in shadow would be {{convert|-100|C|F}}. These temperatures could cause the [[atmospheric reentry#Thermal protection systems|heat shield]] to crack and propellant lines to burst.

The crew had been awake for more than 16 hours. Before launch, NASA had decided at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with problems that might arise. Borman started the first sleep shift but found sleeping difficult because of the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises. Testing on the ground had shown that the [[Apollo command and service module#Service propulsion system|service propulsion system]] (SPS) engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its [[combustion chamber]] was  \" coated \"  first by burning the engine for a short period.

Borman initially did not want everyone to know about his medical problems, but Lovell and Anders wanted to inform Mission Control. The crew decided to use the Data Storage Equipment (DSE), which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to Mission Control at high speed.

The launch time of Apollo{{nbsp}}8 had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site. A [[film camera]] had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record one frame per second of the Moon below. Bill Anders spent much of the next 20 hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest.

Despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft, Borman was able to sleep for two orbits, awakening periodically to ask questions about their status. Borman awoke fully, however, when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes. They were beginning to not understand questions and had to ask for the answers to be repeated. Borman realized that everyone was extremely tired from not having a good night's sleep in over three days. He ordered Anders and Lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the Moon be scrubbed. Anders initially protested, saying that he was fine, but Borman would not be swayed. Anders finally agreed under the condition that Borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic pictures of the Moon. Borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned, and with so many people expected to be watching, he wanted the crew to be alert. For the next two orbits, Anders and Lovell slept while Borman sat at the helm. < ref name= \" journal day 4-456 \" / > {{sfn|Kluger|2017|pp=240\u2013241}} \n \n As they rounded the Moon for the ninth time, the astronauts began the second television transmission.

Borman described it as being  \" a vast, lonely, forbidding expanse of nothing \" .{{sfn|De Groot|2006|p=229}} Then, after talking about what they were flying over, Anders said that the crew had a message for all those on Earth. Each man on board [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|read a section from the Biblical creation story]] from the [[Book of Genesis]]. Borman finished the broadcast by wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone on Earth. His message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit.
