  "Approximant",
  "{{IPA notice}} \n \n '''Approximants''' are [[phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]] that involve the [[Speech organ|articulators]] approaching each other but not narrowly enough < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1975|p=277}} < /ref >  nor with enough articulatory precision < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n|2004|p=201}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}} < /ref >  to create [[manner of articulation|turbulent airflow]]. Therefore, approximants fall between [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], which do produce a turbulent airstream, and [[vowel]]s, which produce no turbulence.{{sfnp|Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n|2004|p=201}} This class is composed of sounds like {{IPA|[\u0279]}} (as in ''rest'') and [[semivowels]] like {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} (as in ''yes'' and ''west'', respectively), as well as [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] approximants like {{IPA|[l]}} (as in ''less'').{{sfnp|Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n|2004|p=201}} \n \n ==Terminology== \n \n Before [[Peter Ladefoged]] coined the term  \" approximant \"  in the 1960s, < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n|2004|p=201}}, pointing to {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1964|p=25}} < /ref >  the terms  \" frictionless continuant \"  and  \" semivowel \"  were used to refer to non-lateral approximants. \n \n In [[phonology]],  \" approximant \"  is also a [[distinctive feature]] that encompasses all [[sonorant]]s except [[nasal consonant|nasals]], including [[vowel]]s, [[Tap consonant|tap]]s and [[Trill consonant|trill]]s.{{sfnp|Hall|2007|p=316}} \n \n ==Semivowels== \n {{main|Semivowel}} \n Some approximants resemble vowels in acoustic and articulatory properties and the terms ''[[semivowel]]'' and ''glide'' are often used for these non-syllabic vowel-like segments. The correlation between semivowels and vowels is strong enough that cross-language differences between semivowels correspond with the differences between their related vowels. < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=323}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Maddieson|Emmorey|1985}} < /ref > \n \n Vowels and their corresponding semivowels alternate in many languages depending on the phonological environment, or for grammatical reasons, as is the case with [[Indo-European ablaut]]. Similarly, languages often avoid configurations where a semivowel precedes its corresponding vowel. < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|p=680}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Kawasaki|1982}} < /ref >  A number of phoneticians distinguish between semivowels and approximants by their location in a syllable. Although he uses the terms interchangeably, {{Harvcoltxt|Montreuil|2004|p=104}} remarks that, for example, the final glides of English ''par'' and ''buy'' differ from French ''par'' ('through') and ''baille'' ('tub') in that, in the latter pair, the approximants appear in the [[syllable coda]], whereas, in the former, they appear in the [[syllable nucleus]]. This means that opaque (if not minimal) contrasts can occur in languages like [[Italian language|Italian]] (with the i-like sound of ''piede'' 'foot', appearing in the nucleus: {{IPA|[\u02c8pi\u032f\u025b\u02d1de]}}, and that of ''piano'' 'slow', appearing in the syllable onset: {{IPA|[\u02c8pja\u02d1no]}}) < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Montreuil|2004|p=104}} < /ref >  and Spanish (with a near minimal pair being ''abyecto'' {{IPA|[a\u03b2\u02c8jekto]}} 'abject' and ''abierto'' {{IPA|[a\u02c8\u03b2i\u032ferto]}} 'opened'). < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Saporta|1956|p=288}} < /ref > \n :{|class= \" wikitable \"  border= \" 1 \" \n |- \n |+Approximant-vowel correspondences < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n|2004|p=202}} < /ref > < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=323}} < /ref > \n !

A transcription with the IPA character for an [[alveolar approximant]] ({{IPA|[\u0279]}}) is common, though the sound is more [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]]. Actual retroflexion may occur as well and both occur as variations of the same sound. < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Hall\u00e9|Best|Levitt|Andrea|1999|p=283}} citing {{Harvcoltxt|Delattre|Freeman|1968}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Zawadzki|Kuehn|1980}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Boyce|Espy-Wilson|1997}} < /ref >  However, {{Harvcoltxt|Catford|1988|p=161f}} makes a distinction between the vowels of American English (which he calls  \" rhotacized \" ) and vowels with  \" retroflexion \"  such as those that appear in [[Badaga language|Badaga]]; {{Harvcoltxt|Trask|1996|p=310}}, on the other hand, labels both as [[r-colored vowel|r-colored]] and notes that both have a lowered third [[formant]]. < ref > Both cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Hamann|2003|pp=25\u201326}} < /ref > \n :{{note|Retroflex|**}} Because the vowels {{IPA|[i \u026f]}} are articulated with spread lips, spreading is implied for their approximant analogues, {{IPA|[j \u0270]}}. However, these sounds generally have little or no lip-spreading. The fricative letters with a lowering diacritic, {{angbr IPA|\u029d\u02d5 \u0263\u02d5}}, may therefore be justified for a neutral articulation between spread {{IPA|[j \u0270]}} and rounded {{IPA|[\u0265 w]}}. < ref > John Esling (2010)  \" Phonetic Notation \" , in Hardcastle, Laver  &  Gibbon (eds) ''The Handbook of Phonetic Sciences'', 2nd ed., p. 699. < /ref > \n \n In articulation and often diachronically, [[palatal consonant|palatal]] approximants correspond to [[front vowel]]s, [[velar consonant|velar]] approximants to [[back vowel]]s, and labialized approximants to [[rounded vowel]]s. In American English, the [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] approximant corresponds to the rhotic vowel. This can create alternations (as shown in the above table). \n \n In addition to alternations, glides can be inserted to the left or the right of their corresponding vowels when they occur next to a hiatus. < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|p=672}} < /ref >  For example, in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], medial {{IPA|/i/}} triggers the formation of an inserted {{IPA|[j]}} that acts as a syllable onset so that when the affix {{IPA|/-ist/}} is added to \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b ('football') to make \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0441\u0442 'football player', it is pronounced {{IPA|[futbo\u031e\u02c8list]}}, but \u043c\u0430\u043e\u0457\u0441\u0442 ('[[Maoist]]'), with the same affix, is pronounced {{IPA|[mao\u031e\u02c8'''j'''ist]}} with a glide. < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|pp=675\u2013676}} < /ref >  [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for many speakers has a similar process that extends to mid vowels: < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|pp=677\u2013678}} < /ref > \n * ''bioscoop'' \u2192 {{IPA|[bi'''j'''\u0254sko\u02d0p]}} ('cinema') \n * ''zee'' + ''en'' \u2192 {{IPA|[ze\u02d0'''j'''\u0259(n)]}} ('seas') \n * ''fluor'' \u2192 {{IPA|[fly'''\u0265'''\u0254r]}} ('fluor') \n * ''reu'' + ''en'' \u2192 {{IPA|[r\u00f8'''\u0265'''\u0259(n)]}} ('male dogs') \n * ''Rwanda'' \u2192 {{IPA|[ru'''\u028b'''and\u0250]}} ('[[Rwanda]]') < ref name= \" Dutch \" > There is dialectal and allophonic variation in the realization of {{IPA|/\u028b/}}. For speakers who realize it as {{IPA|[\u028b]}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|p=683}} postulates an additional rule that changes any occurrence of {{IPA|[w]}} from glide insertion into {{IPA|[\u028b]}}. < /ref > \n * ''Boaz'' \u2192 {{IPA|[bo'''\u028b'''as]}} ('[[Boaz]]') < ref name= \" Dutch \" / > \n \n Similarly, vowels can be inserted next to their corresponding glide in certain phonetic environments. [[Sievers' law]] describes this behaviour for [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]. \n \n Non-high semivowels also occur. In colloquial [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speech, a process of [[glide-formation]] occurs, where one of two adjacent vowels becomes non-syllabic; the process includes mid vowels so that {{IPA|[d\u02b1o\u032fa]}} ('cause to wish') features a non-syllabic mid vowel. < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=323\u2013324}} < /ref >  Spanish features a similar process and even nonsyllabic {{IPA|/a/}} can occur so that ''ahorita'' ('right away') is pronounced {{IPA|[a\u032fo\u031e\u02c8\u027eita]}}. < ref > {{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n|Fern\u00e1ndez-Planas|Carrera-Sabat\u00e9|2003|pp=256\u2013257}} < /ref >  It is not often clear, however, whether such sequences involve a semivowel (a consonant) or a diphthong (a vowel), and in many cases, it may not be a meaningful distinction. \n \n Although many languages have [[central vowel]]s {{IPA|[\u0268, \u0289]}}, which lie between back/velar {{IPA|[\u026f, u]}} and front/palatal {{IPA|[i, y]}}, there are few cases of a corresponding approximant {{IPA|[ \u0237\u0308]}}.

There are problems in distinguishing voiceless approximants from voiceless [[fricative]]s. \n \n === Disagreement over use of the term === \n Voiceless approximants are treated as a phonetic category by (among others) {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Catford|1977}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Bickford|Floyd|2006}}. However, the term ''voiceless approximant'' is not used or recognized by the [[International Phonetic Association]] and is seen by some phoneticians as controversial. It has been pointed out that if ''approximant'' is defined as a speech sound that involves the articulators approaching each other but not narrowly enough to create turbulent airflow, then it is difficult to see how a ''voiceless'' approximant could be audible.{{sfnp|Akamatsu|1992|p=30}} As [[John C. Wells]] puts it in his blog,  \" voiceless approximants are by definition inaudible & nbsp;... If there's no friction and no voicing, there's nothing to hear. \" < ref > {{cite web |last1=Wells |first1=J.

Voiceless approximants are rare in the languages of the world, but when they do occur the airflow is usually somewhat turbulent. \" {{sfnp|Ball|Rahilly|1999|pp=50\u20131}} Audible voiceless sounds may also be produced by means of turbulent airflow at the glottis, as in {{IPA|[h]}}; in such a case, it is possible to articulate an audible voiceless sound without the production of local friction at a supraglottal constriction. {{Harvcoltxt|Catford|1977}} describes such sounds, but classes them as [[sonorant]]s.{{sfnp|Catford|1977|pp=122\u20133}} \n \n === Distinctiveness === \n Voiceless approximants are rarely if ever distinguished phonemically from voiceless fricatives in the sound system of a language. {{Harvcoltxt|Clark|Yallop|1995}} discuss the issue and conclude  \" In practice, it is difficult to distinguish between a voiceless approximant and a voiceless fricative at the same place of articulation & nbsp;... there is no evidence that any language in the world makes such a distinction crucial. \" {{sfnp|Clark|Yallop|1995|p=48}} \n \n ==Nasal approximants== \n (Not to be confused with 'nasal continuant', which is a synonym for [[nasal consonant]]) \n \n Examples are: \n *[[nasal palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[j\u0303]}} \n *[[nasal labialized velar approximant]] {{IPA|[w\u0303]}} \n *[[voiceless nasal glottal approximant]] {{IPA|[h\u0303]}} \n \n In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the '''nasal glides''' {{IPA|[j\u0303]}} and {{IPA|[w\u0303]}} historically became {{IPA|/\u0272/}} and {{IPA|/m/}} in some words.
