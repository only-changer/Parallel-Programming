For example, the aspect ratio of a [[rectangle]] is the ratio of its longer side to its shorter side{{snds}}the ratio of width to height, < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/aspect-ratio |title=What is aspect ratio? |first=Margaret |last=Rouse |date=September 2005 |access-date=3 February 2013 |work=WhatIs? |publisher=TechTarget}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://e3displays.com/wide-aspect-ratio-display/ |title=Wide aspect ratio display |first=Margaret |last=Rouse |date=September 2002|access-date=18 February 2020|work=display |publisher=E3displays}} < /ref >  when the rectangle is oriented as a  \" landscape \" . \n \n The aspect ratio is most often expressed as two integer numbers separated by a colon (x:y), less commonly as a simple or decimal [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]. The values x and y do not represent actual widths and heights but, rather, the proportion between width and height. As an example, 8:5, 16:10, 1.6:1, {{Frac|8|5}} and 1.6 are all ways of representing the same aspect ratio. \n \n In objects of more than two dimensions, such as [[hyperrectangle]]s, the aspect ratio can still be defined as the ratio of the longest side to the shortest side. \n \n ==Applications and uses== \n The term is most commonly used with reference to: \n * Graphic / image \n ** [[Aspect ratio (image)|Image aspect ratio]] \n ** [[Display aspect ratio]] \n ** [[Paper size]] \n ** [[Standard photographic print sizes]] \n ** [[List of film formats|Motion picture film formats]] \n ** [[Standard ad size]] \n ** [[Pixel aspect ratio]] \n ** [[Photolithography]]: the aspect ratio of an etched, or deposited structure is the ratio of the height of its vertical side wall to its width. \n * [[HARMST]] High Aspect Ratios allow the construction of tall microstructures without slant \n * [[Tire code]] \n * [[Tire sizing]] \n * [[Turbocharger]] impeller sizing \n * [[Aspect ratio (wing)|Wing aspect ratio]] of an aircraft or bird \n * [[Astigmatism (optical systems)|Astigmatism]] of an [[optical lens]] \n * Nanorod dimensions \n * [[Shape factor (image analysis and microscopy)]] \n \n ==Aspect ratios of simple shapes== \n \n ===Rectangles=== \n {{Main|Aspect ratio (image)}} \n For a rectangle, the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the width to the height of the rectangle. A [[square]] has the smallest possible aspect ratio of 1:1. \n \n Examples: \n * 4:3 = 1.{{overline|3}}: Some (not all) 20th century computer monitors ([[VGA]], [[XGA]], etc.), [[standard-definition television]] \n *  < math > \\sqrt{2}:1 = 1.414... < /math > : international paper sizes ([[ISO 216]]) \n * 3:2 = 1.5: [[135 film|35mm still camera film]], [[iPhone#Model comparison|iPhone]] (until [[iPhone 5]]) displays \n * [[16:10]] = 1.6: commonly used [[widescreen]] [[computer display]]s ([[WXGA (graphics)|WXGA]]) \n * \u03a6:1 = 1.618...: [[golden ratio]], close to 16:10 \n * 5:3 = 1.{{overline|6}}: [[super 16 mm]],  a standard [[film gauge]] in many European countries \n * 16:9 = 1.{{overline|7}}: [[widescreen]] TV \n * 2:1 = 2: [[Domino (mathematics)|dominoes]] \n * 64:27 = 2.{{overline|370}}: ultra-widescreen, [[21:9 aspect ratio|21:9]] \n * 32:9 = 3.{{overline|5}}: super ultra-widescreen \n \n ===Ellipses=== \n For an ellipse, the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the [[major axis]] to the [[minor axis]]. An ellipse with an aspect ratio of 1:1 is a circle. \n [[File:Elps-slr.svg|center|500px]] \n \n ==Aspect ratios of general shapes== \n \n In [[geometry]], there are several alternative definitions to aspect ratios of general [[compact set]]s in a d-dimensional space: < ref name=SmithWormald1998 > {{Cite book  \n | last1 = Smith | first1 = W.

A circle has the minimal DWAR which is 1. A square has a DWAR of  < math > \\sqrt{2} < /math > . \n * The cube-volume aspect ratio (CVAR) of a compact set is the  < i > d < /i > -th root of the ratio of the  < i > d < /i > -volume of the smallest enclosing axes-parallel  < i > d < /i > -cube, to the set's own  < i > d < /i > -volume. A square has the minimal CVAR which is 1. A circle has a CVAR of  < math > \\sqrt{2} < /math > . An axis-parallel rectangle of width  < i > W < /i >  and height  < i > H < /i > , where  < i > W < /i > & gt; < i > H < /i > , has a CVAR of  < math > \\sqrt{W^2/WH} = \\sqrt{W/H} < /math > . \n \n If the dimension  < i > d < /i >  is fixed, then all reasonable definitions of aspect ratio are equivalent to within constant factors. \n \n ==Notations== \n Aspect ratios are mathematically expressed as ''x'':''y'' (pronounced  \" x-to-y \" ). \n \n Cinematographic aspect ratios are usually denoted as a (rounded) decimal multiple of width vs unit height, while photographic and videographic aspect ratios are usually defined and denoted by whole number ratios of width to height. In [[digital image]]s there is a subtle distinction between the ''display'' aspect ratio (the image as displayed) and the [[Storage aspect ratio|''storage'' aspect ratio]] (the ratio of pixel dimensions); see [[Aspect ratio (image)#Distinctions|Distinctions]]. \n \n ==See also== \n * [[Axial ratio]] \n * [[Ratio]] \n * [[Equidimensional]] ratios in 3D \n * [[List of film formats]] \n * [[Squeeze mapping]] \n * [[Scale (ratio)]] \n * [[Vertical orientation]] \n \n == References== \n < references / > \n \n {{Fractions and ratios}} \n \n {{DEFAULTSORT:Aspect Ratio}} \n [[Category:Ratios]]"
