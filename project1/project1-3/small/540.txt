The [[Anaximenes (crater)|Anaximenes]] crater on the [[Moon]] is named in his honor.  \n \n Some of Anaximenes' writings are referenced during the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic Age]], but no record of these documents currently exist. [[Apollodorus of Damascus]] estimated Anaximenes' lifespan as having [[Floruit|flourished]] during the same time period in which [[Cyrus the Great]] defeated [[Croesus]] at the [[Battle of Thymbra]] in 546 BC. < ref name= \" :02 \" / >  Philosophy may have spread elsewhere because Miletus was captured by the [[Military history of Iran|Persian army]] in 494 BC. < ref name= \" :23 \" / > \n \n ==Air as the Arche== \n Anaximenes  thought air was the primary substance that held the universe together.  He believed that [[air]] was infinite and divine. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  He was the first to use the word ''[[pneuma]]'' (\u201c[[Breathing|breath]] of life\u201d) as a synonym for air. One of the only surviving quotes by Anaximenes reads: \u201cJust as our soul...being air holds us together, so ''pneuma'' and air encompass [and guard] the whole world.\u201d < ref name= \" :23 \"  / >  The analogy compared atmospheric air as the divine and human air as souls that animate people. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  This relation of the macroscopic and microscopic suggested Anaximenes believed there was an overarching principle that regulated all life and behavior. < ref name= \" :12 \"  / >  Interestingly, the [[Old Testament]] features a similar analogy to the founding of the world and creation of man, but Anaximenes did not recognize a creator of the universe and did not think of the ''pneuma'' as a creator to guide man. < ref name= \" :23 \"  / > \n \n ===Condensation and rarefaction=== \n The choice of air may seem arbitrary, but Anaximenes based his conclusion on naturally observable phenomena in the [[water cycle]], and the processes of rarefaction and condensation. < ref > Guthrie, W.K.C.  \" The Milesians: Anaximenes. \"  ''A History of Greek Philosophy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. 116. < /ref >  The primary difference in the forms of air as matter was the degree of condensation and density. < ref name= \" :12 \"  / >  When air condenses it becomes visible, and according to Anaximenes, the spread-out, invisible, infinite air was condensed to wind, then formed into clouds, which condensed further to produce mist, rain, and other forms of precipitation. < ref name= \" :12 \"  / > < ref name= \" :23 \"  / >  As the condensed air cooled, Anaximenes supposed that Earth itself was an early condensate of air\u2014the process continued until the air was condensed enough to form solids like the Earth and ultimately stones. By contrast, Anaximenes was able to visually see how water evaporates into air and based his concept of rarefaction on this observation. According to him, any object that held light was made of fire, and fire was made from the rarefaction of air. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / > \n \n While other philosophers also recognized such transitions in states of matter, Anaximenes was the first to associate the qualitative change in hot/dry and cold/wet pairings with the density of a single material, effectively adding a quantitative dimension to the Milesian [[Material monism|monistic system]]. < ref name= \" guthrie1242 \" > Guthrie, W.K.C.  \" The Milesians: Anaximenes. \"  ''A History of Greek Philosophy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962. 124\u2013126. < /ref > < ref > Kirk, G.S., J.E. Raven, and M. Schofield.  \" Anaximenes of Miletus. \"  ''The Presocratic Philosophers''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984. 146. < /ref >  He attributed condensation to cold/wet air and rarefaction to the interaction of hot/dry air. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / > \n \n ===Cosmology=== \n Having concluded that everything in the world is composed of air, Anaximenes used his theory to devise a scheme that explains the origins and nature of the earth and the surrounding celestial bodies.  Air felted to create the flat disk of the earth, which he said was table-like and behaved like a leaf floating on air. Anaximenes did not think that stars were floating leaf-like bodies similar to the earth and sun; instead, he thought of stars being similar to nails that are stuck in a transparent shell. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / >  In keeping with the prevailing view of celestial bodies as balls of fire in the sky, Anaximenes proposed that the earth let out an exhalation of air that rarefied, ignited and became the stars. While the sun is similarly described as being aflame, it is not composed of rarefied air like the stars, but rather of earth like the moon; its burning comes not from its composition but rather from its rapid motion. < ref > Kirk, G.S., J.E. Raven, and M. Schofield.  \" Anaximenes of Miletus. \"  ''The Presocratic Philosophers''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984.  152\u2013153. < /ref >  Similarly, he considered the moon and sun to be flat and floating on streams of air. In his theory, when the sun sets it does not pass under the earth, but is merely obscured by higher parts of the earth as it circles around and becomes more distant. Anaximenes likens the motion of the sun and the other celestial bodies around the earth to the way that a cap may be turned around the head. < ref name= \" graham \" > Graham, Daniel W.

Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner, 1898. 20. < /ref >  Anaximenes believed that the sky was a dome, and day and night are caused by celestial bodies being carried North until they are no longer seen. There is evidence that suggests Anaximenes may have been the first person to distinguish between planets and fixed stars. < ref name= \" :02 \"  / > \n \n ===Other phenomena=== \n Anaximenes used his observations and reasoning to provide causes for other natural phenomena on the earth as well. [[Earthquake]]s, he asserted, were the result either of lack of moisture, which causes the earth to break apart because of how parched it is, or of superabundance of water, which also causes cracks in the earth. In either case the earth becomes weakened by its cracks, so that hills collapse and cause earthquakes. [[Lightning]] is similarly caused by the violent separation of clouds by the wind, creating a bright, fire-like flash. [[Rainbow]]s, on the other hand, are formed when densely compressed air is touched by the rays of the sun. < ref > Fairbanks, Arthur.   \" Anaximenes \" . ''The First Philosophers of Greece''. K. Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner, 1898. 18;20\u201321. < /ref >   These examples show how Anaximenes, like the other [[Milesian school|Milesian philosophers]], looked for the broader picture in nature. They sought unifying causes for diversely occurring events, rather than treating each one on a case-by-case basis, or attributing them to gods or to a personified [[nature]]. < ref name= \" lindberg292 \"  / > \n \n ==Influence on philosophy== \n [[File:Anaximenes of Miletus Drawing.jpg|thumb|An artist's rendition of Anaximenes of Miletus|left]] \n Since language and communication were very limited in his time, Anaximenes's analogies were key in explaining the uncertain through the certain. For example, he knew for certain that blowing air on his hand with his mouth wide open produced hot air, while blowing on his hand with half-closed lips produced cold air. These observations were key in his postulate that the hot air was due to rarefaction and expansion, whereas the cold air was due to condensation and compression. Although in modern times it is known that this is actually the opposite, Anaximenes was key in arriving at this conclusion. His analogies often connected parallels between man and the cosmos, insinuating that the same natural laws observable on earth applied to the heavens. Over 2000 years later, [[Isaac Newton]] proved this to be true. Throughout history, Anaximenes's observations proved helpful to uncover powerful theories, such as [[Quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]]. By the end of the Milesian philosophy era, there were many questions left unanswered; this sparked the stimulation of Pre-socratic thought to continue through many other notable philosophers such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]], and [[Democritus]]. < ref name= \" :23 \"  / > \n \n Anaximenes greatest influence is not from his theories of matter, but instead it is from how he thought about these ideas. For instance, his theory of air being the underlying substance was disproved, but when looking at his idea from a fundamental aspect, in which a substance is capable of changing forms, his theory was the first of its kind. < ref > {{Cite book|title=Ancient Greece|date=2007|publisher=Salem Press|others=Sienkewicz, Thomas J.|isbn=9781587654121|location=Pasadena, Calif.|oclc=174134701}} < /ref > \n \n ===Plato and Aristotle=== \n Many similarities to Anaximenes's theories are apparent in [[Plato]]\u2019s theory. So much so, that some scholars have said Plato has based his theory of matter on Anaximenes's theory. In [[Aristotle]]\u2019s view on Anaximenes, he interprets the theory as the one substance being air, and all other states of matter are different condensations of air. In Plato's interpretation of Anaximenes's theory, he considers the seven states of matter: fire, air, wind, clouds, earth and stone as different densities. Acknowledging that these seven states of matter are different densities shows how the intrinsic properties of the matter have changed, and they are actually different substances. Anaximenes supports this conclusion by his explanation using the concept of felting. Felting is a technological model used to explain condensation, in which wool turns into felt and has new properties. < ref name= \" :4 \" > {{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Daniel W.|date=2015-12-30|title=Plato and Anaximenes|url=http://journals.openedition.org/etudesplatoniciennes/706|journal=\u00c9tudes Platoniciennes|language=en|issue=12|doi=10.4000/etudesplatoniciennes.706|issn=2275-1785|doi-access=free}} < /ref >  Just as how wind is compressed into clouds in Anaximenes's theory. Without recognizing Anaximenes's influence on Plato, and simply focusing on Anaximenes's influence on Aristotle, Anaximenes's contributions to scientific thought are not fully recognized. Aristotle interpreted Anaximenes's theory as all substance being different manifestations of air. It was Plato's interpretation of Anaximenes's theory that recognized the fundamental changes of air into other substances. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=D.|date=2003|title=A testimony of Anaximenes in Plato|journal=The Classical Quarterly|volume=53|issue=2|pages=327\u2013337|doi=10.1093/cq/53.2.327}} < /ref > \n \n Because Plato's theory does not recognize Anaximenes's by name, some scholars have doubted that Plato's theory was actually influenced by Anaximenes. The proponents of the influence have written that the uniqueness of Anaximenes's theory and obvious similarities to Plato's theory prove the connection. < ref name= \" :4 \"  / > \n \n ==References== \n {{reflist}} \n \n ==Further reading== \n * {{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Jonathan|title=The Presocratic Philosophers |location=London|publisher=Routledge|year= 1982}} \n * {{cite book|author-link=John Burnet (classicist)|last=Burnet|first=John|title=Early Greek Philosophy|url=http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/burnet/index.htm|edition=3rd|location=London|publisher=Black|year=1920|access-date=2011-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111171732/http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/burnet/index.htm|archive-date=2011-01-11|url-status=dead}} \n * {{cite book | last=Freeman | first=Kathleen | title=Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers  | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=1978 | isbn=978-0-674-03500-3}} \n * {{cite book|author-link= W.
