Their name derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''el lagarto'', which means  \" the lizard \" . \n \n == Caimans == \n In [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], the alligator family is represented by six species of the subfamily [[Caimaninae]], which differ from the alligator by the absence of a bony septum between the nostrils, and having ventral armour composed of overlapping bony [[scute]]s, each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture. Besides the three species in ''[[Caiman (genus)|Caiman]]'', the smooth-fronted caimans in genus ''[[Paleosuchus]]'' and the black caiman in ''[[Melanosuchus]]'' are described. Caimans tend to be more agile and crocodile-like in their movements, and have longer, sharper teeth than alligators. < ref name= \" Guggisberg \" > {{cite book | author = Guggisberg, C.A.W. | title = Crocodiles: Their Natural History, Folklore, and Conservation| year = 1972 | page = 195 | isbn = 978-0-7153-5272-4}} < /ref > \n \n ''C. crocodilus'', the [[spectacled caiman]], has the widest distribution, from southern Mexico to the northern half of Argentina, and grows to a modest size of about {{convert|2.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The largest is the [[red list|near-threatened]] ''Melanosuchus niger'', the ''jacar\u00e9-a\u00e7u'' or large or [[black caiman]] of the [[Amazon River]] basin. Black caimans grow to {{convert|16.5|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}}, with the largest recorded size {{convert|5.79|m|abbr=on}}. The black caiman and [[American alligator]] are the only members of the alligator family that pose the same danger to humans as the larger species of the [[crocodile]] family. \n \n Although caimans have not been studied in depth, scientists have learned their mating cycles (previously thought to be spontaneous or year-round) are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels, which increases chances of survival for their offspring. \n \n == Taxonomy == \n [[File:Crocnest.JPG|thumb|right|An alligator nest at [[Everglades National Park]], [[Florida]], United States]] \n [[File:Spectacled caiman by Keven Law.jpg|thumb|[[Spectacled caiman]] head]] \n [[File:Wikipedia-7744.jpg|thumb|[[Black caiman]], [[Jauaperi River]], Amazonia]] \n [[File:Ca\u00efman de Schneider (Paleosuchus trigonatus).jpg|thumb|Head of [[smooth-fronted caiman]]]] \n * '''Superfamily [[Alligatoroidea]]''' \n ** '''Family Alligatoridae''' \n *** '''Subfamily [[Alligatorinae]]''' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Albertochampsa]]'' \n **** Genus ''[[Alligator]]'' \n ***** \u2020 ''[[Alligator mcgrewi]]'' \n ***** \u2020 ''[[Alligator mefferdi]]'' \n ***** [[American alligator]], ''Alligator mississippiensis \n ***** \u2020 ''[[Alligator olseni]]'' \n ***** \u2020 ''[[Alligator prenasalis]]'' \n ***** [[Chinese alligator]], ''Alligator sinensis '' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Allognathosuchus]]'' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Arambourgia]]'' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Ceratosuchus]]'' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Chrysochampsa]]'' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Eoalligator]]'' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Hassiacosuchus]]'' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Hispanochampsa]]'' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Krabisuchus]]'' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Navajosuchus]]'' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Procaimanoidea]]'' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Wannaganosuchus]]'' \n *** '''Subfamily [[Caimaninae]]''' \n **** Genus ''[[Caiman (genus)|Caiman]]'' \n ***** [[Yacare caiman]], ''Caiman yacare'' \n ***** [[Spectacled caiman]], ''Caiman crocodilus '' \n ****** Rio Apaporis caiman, ''C. c. apaporiensis '' \n ****** Brown caiman, ''C. c. fuscus'' \n ***** [[Broad-snouted caiman]], ''Caiman latirostris '' \n ***** \u2020 ''[[Caiman lutescans]]'' \n **** Genus ''[[Melanosuchus]]'' \n ***** \u2020 ''[[Melanosuchus fisheri]]'' \n ***** [[Black caiman]], ''Melanosuchus niger'' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Eocaiman]]'' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Mourasuchus]]'' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Necrosuchus]]'' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Orthogenysuchus]]'' \n **** Genus ''[[Paleosuchus]]'' \n ***** [[Cuvier's dwarf caiman]], ''Paleosuchus palpebrosus'' \n ***** [[Smooth-fronted caiman]], ''Paleosuchus trigonatus'' \n **** Genus \u2020 ''[[Purussaurus]]'' \n \n == References == \n {{Reflist}} \n \n == External links == \n *[http://www.crocodilian.com  \" Crocodilians: Natural History  &  Conservation \" ] ''crocodilian.com'' \n *[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?taxon_no=38421 & is_real_user=1 & action=taxonInfo#  \" Family Alligatoridae Gray 1844 (alligator) \" ], ''fossilworks.org''. \n *{{Commons category-inline}} \n *{{Wikispecies-inline}} \n \n {{Crocodilia|A.}} \n {{Crocs}} \n {{Taxonbar|from=Q6184764}} \n \n [[Category:Alligatoridae| ]] \n [[Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray]] \n [[Category:Reptile families]] \n [[Category:Extant Campanian first appearances]] \n [[Category:Campanian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Maastrichtian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Danian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Selandian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Thanetian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Ypresian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Lutetian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Bartonian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Priabonian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Rupelian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Chattian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Aquitanian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Burdigalian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Langhian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Serravallian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Tortonian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Messinian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Zanclean taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Piacenzian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Gelasian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Calabrian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Ionian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Tarantian taxonomic families]] \n [[Category:Holocene taxonomic families]]"
