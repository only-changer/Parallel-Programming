  "{{Short description|Town of ancient Acarnania in Greece}} \n [[File:Battle of Actium-en.svg|thumb|300px|A map showing the [[Battle of Actium]].]] \n '''Actium''' or '''Aktion''' ({{lang-grc|\u1f0c\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}}) was a town on a promontory in [[ancient Acarnania]] at the entrance of the [[Ambraciot Gulf]] off which [[Augustus|Octavian]] gained his celebrated victory, the [[Battle of Actium]], over [[Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]], on September 2, 31 & nbsp;BCE. \n \n ==History== \n [[File:Castro Battle of Actium.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Actium]] by [[Laureys a Castro]], 1672. Note anachronisms.]] \n Actium belonged originally to the [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]ian colonists of [[Anactorium]], who probably founded the sanctuary of [[Apollo|Apollo Actius]]. < ref > E. Kristen:  \" The Origins of the first inhabitants of Nicopolis \" , Proceedings of the First International Symposium on Nicopolis, 1984 < /ref > < ref > {{Cite Thucydides|1.29}} < /ref >  This temple was of great antiquity.  In the 3rd century & nbsp;BCE it fell to the Acarnanians, who subsequently held their religious summits there. \n \n There was also an ancient festival named [[Actia]], celebrated here in honour of the god. Augustus after his victory enlarged the temple, and revived the ancient festival, which was henceforth celebrated once in five years (\u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03c2, ludi quinquennales), with musical and gymnastic contests, and horse races. < ref > [[Dio Cassius]] 51.1; [[Suetonius]] ''Aug.'' 18. < /ref >  We learn from a Greek inscription found on the site of Actium, and which is probably prior to the time of Augustus, that the chief priest of the temple was called \u1f39\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, and that his name was employed in official documents, like that of the first Archon at Athens, to mark the date. < ref > [[August B\u00f6ckh]], ''Corpus Inscript.'' No. 1793. < /ref >  [[Strabo]] says that the temple was situated on an eminence, and that below was a plain with a grove of trees, and a dock-yard; < ref > {{Cite Strabo|p. 325}} < /ref >  and in another passage he describes the harbour as situated outside of the gulf. < ref > {{Cite Strabo|p. 451}} < /ref >  On the opposite coast of Epirus, Augustus founded the city of [[Nicopolis]] in honour of his victory. After the foundation of Nicopolis, a few buildings sprang up around the temple, and it served as a kind of suburb to Nicopolis. \n \n ==Archaeology== \n On October 8, 1980, the Greek Ministry of Transport and Communications reported that shipwrecks from the Battle of Actium had been located at Actium near the entrance to the Ambracian Gulf. < ref > \" Greece Reports Finding Wrecks Of Romans Ships\u2014 Buried Vessels Are Linked to the Battle of Actium \" , by Paul Anastasi, ''The New York Times'', October 8, 1980, pA3 < /ref > \n \n In Summer 2009, archaeologists discovered the ruins of the Temple of Apollo and found two statue heads, one of Apollo, one of Artemis (Diana). \n \n ==See also== \n *[[Battle of Actium]] \n * [[List of ancient Greek cities]] \n \n {{coord|38.953|N|20.768|E|display=title|source:dewiki}} \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n {{DGRG|title=Actium}} \n \n ==External links== \n {{Commons category}} \n \n {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Actium}} \n \n {{Authority control}} \n \n [[Category:Ancient Greek archaeological sites in Greece]] \n [[Category:Archaeological sites in Western Greece]] \n [[Category:Corinthian colonies]] \n [[Category:Former populated places in Greece]] \n [[Category:Populated places in ancient Acarnania]] \n [[Category:Populated places in ancient Greece]] \n [[Category:Roman sites in Greece]] \n \n \n {{AncientAcarnania-geo-stub}}"
