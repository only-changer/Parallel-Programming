Meanwhile, the aim of the '''International Institute of African Languages and Cultures''', later known as [[International African Institute]] (IAI), was to enable people to write all the [[African languages]] for practical and scientific purposes without the need of [[diacritic]]s. It is based on the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] with a few differences, such as ''j'' and ''y'', which instead have the same (consonant) sound values as in English. \n \n This alphabet has influenced development of orthographies of many African languages (serving  \" as the basis for the transcription \"  of about 60, by one count < ref > Sow, Alfa I., and Mohamed H.
