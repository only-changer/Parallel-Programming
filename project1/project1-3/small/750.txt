Unemployment is low (although the government has not published statistics since 2013) and per capita income is one of the highest in the Caribbean (approximately $24,087). At the end of 2018, the labor force participation rate was 56.6% for women. \n \n Until the mid-1980s, Aruba's main industry was oil refining. Then the refinery was shut down and the island's economy shifted towards tourism. Currently, Aruba receives about 1,235,673 (2007) guests per year, of which three-quarters are Americans. Tourism is mainly focused on the beaches and the sea. The refinery has been closed and restarted repeatedly during the last decades. In recent years a letter of intent was signed with CITGO (the US subsidiary of the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA) to explore the possibility of reopening the refinery again. \n \n Until 2009, the Netherlands granted development aid to Aruba. This aid was mainly for law enforcement, education, administrative development, health care and sustainable economic development. This aid was discontinued at Aruba's request in 2009. Since 2015, however, a form of financial supervision has been reintroduced because Aruba's debt has risen sharply to over 80% of GDP. \n \n Aruba also has two free trade zones ([[Barcadera]] and Bushiri), where import and export and the movement of services are tax-free. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.freezonearuba.com/aruba-free-zone/barcadera-free-zone/ |title=Barcadera Free Zone|website=Free Zone Aruba|access-date=1 May 2021}} < /ref > \n \n ===Tourism=== \n [[File:RIU Palace Antillas - Aruba.jpg|thumb|A tourist resort on the island]] \n \n About {{frac|3|4}} of the Aruban [[gross national product]] is earned through tourism and related activities. < ref name= \" CIA \" > {{cite web|title=The World Factbook \u2013 Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/aruba/|website=Cia.gov|access-date=12 October 2016}} < /ref >  Most tourists are from North America, with a market-share of 73.3%, followed by Latin America with 15.2% and Europe with 8.3%. < ref name= \" ATA \" > {{cite news|url=https://antilliaansdagblad.com/aruba/19438-toerisme-aruba-naar-recordhoogte|title=Toerisme Aruba naar recordhoogte|publisher=Antilliaans Dagblad|date=5 May 2019|access-date=24 May 2019|language=nl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506090901/https://antilliaansdagblad.com/aruba/19438-toerisme-aruba-naar-recordhoogte|archive-date=6 May 2019|url-status=live}} < /ref > \n \n For private aircraft passengers bound for the United States, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) has a full pre-clearance facility since 1 February 2001 when Queen Beatrix Airport expanded.

The largest number of tourists come from North America (mainly the [[United States]]), with a market share of 73.3%, in addition to 15.2% from Latin America (mainly [[Venezuela]]) and 8.3% from Europe. In 2018 there were 40,231 visitors from the [[Netherlands]]. There are many luxury and lesser luxury hotels, concentrated mainly on the west coast beaches. In Palm Beach are the luxury hotels aimed at American tourists. This area is also called  \" Highrise-area \" , because most of the hotels are located in (by Aruban standards) high-rise buildings. Eagle Beach, a short distance from Palm Beach in the direction of Oranjestad, offers hotels on a somewhat smaller and more intimate scale in low-rise buildings, hence the name  \" lowrise-area \" . \n \n Oranjestad is, in addition to the capital, an important place in the tourist industry. Here is the port for the many cruise ships that visit Aruba. The cruise industry is a very important pillar of tourism in Aruba, since during a cruise a large part of the passengers go ashore to visit the island. With 334  \" cruise calls \" , Aruba received 815,161 cruise tourists in 2018. According to some sources the 2017/2018 [[Cruise ship|cruise season]] brought $102.8 million to Aruba's economy. Oranjestad is also home to several luxury hotels, upscale shopping malls, and tourist-oriented shopping streets, including  \" Mainstreet, \"  and hospitality facilities. The main street, called Caya G.F. (Betico) Croes, has been redesigned in recent years, including new paving, new palm trees and a streetcar line for tourists. \n \n Also elsewhere on the island you can find the necessary tourist accommodation, even in (private) apartment buildings. \n \n ==Culture== \n {{Main|Culture of Aruba}} \n {{See also|Music of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles}} \n {{See also|Sports in Aruba}} \n [[File:Plaza Daniel Leo, Oranjestad, Aruba - February 2020.jpg|thumb|left|Ornate buildings in [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]]]] \n \n Aruba has a varied culture.

Christmas and [[New Year's Eve]] are celebrated with the typical music and songs for [[Gaita flutes|gaita]]s for Christmas and the Dande{{clarify|date=November 2012}} for New Year, and ''[[Hallaca|ayaca]]'', ''[[ponche crema]]'', ham, and other typical foods and drinks. On 25 January, [[Betico Croes]]' birthday is celebrated. [[St John's Eve|Dia di San Juan]] is celebrated on 24 June. Besides Christmas, the religious holy days of the [[Feast of the Ascension]] and [[Good Friday]] are also holidays on the island. \n \n The festival of [[Carnival|Carnaval]] is also an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries. Its celebration in Aruba started in the 1950s, influenced by the inhabitants from Venezuela and the nearby islands (Cura\u00e7ao, St. Vincent, Trinidad, Barbados, St. Maarten, and Anguilla) who came to work for the oil refinery.  Over the years, the Carnival Celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of January until the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, with a large parade on the last Sunday of the festivities (the Sunday before Ash Wednesday). < ref name= \" arubabeachhouse \" > {{cite web |title=Aruba |url=https://arubabeachhouse.ca/about/aruba/127-government |website=Aruba Beach House |access-date=28 April 2021}} < /ref > \n \n Tourism from the United States has recently increased the visibility of American culture on the island, with such celebrations as [[Halloween]] in October and Thanksgiving Day in November. < ref name= \" arubabeachhouse \" / > \n \n === Architecture === \n From the beginning of the colonization of the [[Netherlands]] until the beginning of the 20th century, the architecture in the most inhabited areas of Aruba was influenced by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] colonial style and also some [[Spanish Empire|Spanish elements]] from the [[Catholic missions|Catholic missionaries]] present in Aruba who later settled in [[Venezuela]] as well. After the boom of the oil industry and the tourist sector in the 20th century the architectural style of the island incorporated a more [[United States|American]] and international influence. In addition, elements of the [[Art Deco]] style can still be seen in several buildings in San Nicolas. Therefore, it can be said that the island's architecture is a mixture of Spanish, Dutch, American and [[Caribbean]] influences. \n \n ==Infrastructure== \n [[File:Aruba electricity production.svg|thumb|Aruba electricity production by source]] \n [[File:AUA Arrivals building.JPG|thumb|right|The Arrivals building at Queen Beatrix International Airport]] \n \n Aruba's [[Queen Beatrix International Airport]] is near Oranjestad. \n \n Aruba has three ports: [[Barcadera]], the main cargo port, [[Paardenbaai]], the port of Oranjestad for passengers, and Commander's Bay in [[Savaneta]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=https://docplayer.nl/113421717-Naar-een-duurzame-inrichting-van-aruba.html |title=Naar een duurzame inrichting van Aruba |publisher=Ministerie Ruimtelijke Onderwikkeling, Infrastructuur en Milieu|language=nl|access-date=2 May 2021|year=2019|page=10}} < /ref >  Paardenbaai services all the cruise-ship lines such as [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]], [[Carnival Cruise Lines|Carnival]], [[Norwegian Cruise Line|NCL]], [[Holland America Line|Holland America]], [[MSC Cruises|MSC Cruises]], [[Costa Cruises|Costa Cruises]], [[P & O Cruises|P & O Cruises]] and [[Disney Cruise Line|Disney]].
