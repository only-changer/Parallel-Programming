He was the last great ruler of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] before the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] conquest. < ref name= \" OCD \" > {{Citation  | last = Lloyd | first = Alan Brian  | contribution = Amasis | year = 1996  | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  | editor1-last = Hornblower  | editor1-first = Simon  | editor1-link =Simon Hornblower  | editor2-last = Spawforth  | editor2-first = Anthony  | editor2-link =Anthony Spawforth  | edition = 3rd  | place = Oxford  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | isbn = 0-19-521693-8}} < /ref > \n \n ==Life== \n {{see also|Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt family tree}} \n Most of our information about him is derived from [[Herodotus]] (2.161ff) and can only be imperfectly verified by monumental evidence.

These troops, returning home from a disastrous military expedition to [[Cyrene (city)|Cyrene]] in Libya, suspected that they had been betrayed in order that [[Apries]], the reigning king, might rule more absolutely by means of his Greek [[mercenaries]]; many Egyptians fully sympathized with them. General Amasis, sent to meet them and quell the revolt, was proclaimed king by the rebels instead, and Apries, who then had to rely entirely on his mercenaries, was defeated. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" > {{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amasis|display=Amasis s.v.

The head of the gate guard Ahmose-sa-Neith appears on numerous monuments, including the location of his sarcophagus. He was referenced on monuments of the 30th Dynasty and apparently had a special significance in his time.  Wahibre was 'Leader of the southern foreigners' and 'Head of the doors of foreigners', so he was the highest official for border security. Under Amasis the career of the doctor, Udjahorresnet, began, who was of particular importance to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]]. Several  \" heads of the fleet \"  are known. Psamtek Meryneit and Pasherientaihet / Padineith are the only known viziers. \n \n [[File:Polykrates with Pharao Amasis II.jpg|thumb|[[Polycrates]], Tyrant of [[Samos]], with Pharaoh Amasis II.]] \n [[Herodotus]] describes how Amasis II would eventually cause a confrontation with the Persian armies. According to Herodotus, Amasis was asked by [[Cambyses II]] or [[Cyrus the Great]] for an Egyptian [[ophthalmologist]] on good terms. Amasis seems to have complied by forcing an Egyptian physician into mandatory labor, causing him to leave his family behind in Egypt and move to Persia in forced exile. In an attempt to exact revenge for this, the physician grew very close to Cambyses and suggested that Cambyses should ask Amasis for a daughter in marriage in order to solidify his bonds with the Egyptians. Cambyses complied and requested a daughter of Amasis for marriage. < ref name=Hero/ > \n \n Amasis, worrying that his daughter would be a concubine to the Persian king, refused to give up his offspring; Amasis also was not willing to take on the Persian empire, so he concocted a deception in which he forced the daughter of the ex-pharaoh [[Apries]], whom Herodotus explicitly confirms to have been killed by Amasis, to go to Persia instead of his own offspring. < ref name= \" Hero \" > {{cite book| author = Herodotus| title = The History of Herodotus Volume I,Book II| url = https://archive.org/details/historyherodotu00herogoog| year = 1737| publisher = D.

This infuriated Cambyses and he vowed to take revenge for it. Amasis died before Cambyses reached him, but his heir and son Psamtik III was defeated by the Persians. < ref name=Hero/ > < ref name=Herodotus/ > \n \n First, Cyrus the Great signed alliance agreements with the [[Lydia]]n King [[Croesus]] and [[Nabonidus]] the Babylonian king in 542 BC. The actual aim of the agreements was to prevent aid between Egypt and her allies. With both now deprived of Egyptian support, the Persians conquered, first, Croesus's empire in 541 BCE, and, then, the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BCE. \n \n Herodotus also describes how, just like his predecessor, Amasis relied on Greek mercenaries and councilmen. One such figure was [[Phanes of Halicarnassus]], who would later leave Amasis, for reasons that Herodotus does not clearly know, but suspects were personal between the two figures. Amasis sent one of his [[eunuch]]s to capture Phanes, but the eunuch was bested by the wise councilman and Phanes fled to Persia, meeting up with Cambyses and providing advice for his invasion of Egypt. Egypt was finally lost to the Persians during the [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)|battle of Pelusium]] in 525 BC. < ref name=Herodotus/ > \n \n ==Egypt's wealth== \n [[File:Statue of Tasherenese, mother of king Amasis II, 570-526 BCE, from Egypt, currently housed in the British Museum.jpg|thumb|Statue of Tasherenese, mother of king Amasis II, 570-526 BCE, British Museum]] \n Amasis brought Egypt into closer contact with Greece than ever before. Herodotus relates that under his prudent administration, Egypt reached a new level of wealth; Amasis adorned the temples of [[Lower Egypt]] especially with splendid [[monolith]]ic [[shrine]]s and other monuments (his activity here is proved by existing remains). < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  For example, a temple built by him was excavated at [[Tell Nebesha]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} \n \n Amasis assigned the commercial colony of [[Naucratis]] on the [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopic]] branch of the [[Nile]] to the Greeks, and when the [[temple of Delphi]] was burnt, he contributed 1,000 [[talent (weight)|talents]] to the rebuilding. He also married a Greek princess named [[Ladice (Cyrenaean Princess)|Ladice]] daughter of King [[Battus III of Cyrene|Battus III]] and made alliances with [[Polycrates]] of Samos and [[Croesus]] of Lydia. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] cites the story by [[Herodotus]] that Ladice cured Amasis of his [[impotence]] by praying to Venus/Aphropdite. < ref name=Montaigne > {{cite book|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/montaigne/michel/essays/complete.html|publisher=The University of Adelaide |title=The Essays of Michel de Montaigne |first=Michel |last=Montaigne, de |translator=Charles Cotton|editor=William Carew Hazlitt|chapter=20|access-date=November 22, 2019}} < /ref > \n \n Under Amasis, Egypt's agricultural based economy reached its zenith. Herodotus, who visited Egypt less than a century after Amasis II's death, writes that: \n {{quote|It is said that it was during the reign of Ahmose II (Amasis) that Egypt attained its highest level of prosperity both in respect of what the river gave the land and in respect of what the land yielded to men and that the number of inhabited cities at that time reached in total 20,000. < ref > Herodotus, (II, 177, 1) < /ref > }} \n \n His kingdom consisted probably of Egypt only, as far as the [[First Cataract]], but to this he added [[Cyprus]], and his influence was great in [[Cyrene, Libya]]. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  In his fourth year ({{circa|lk=no|567}} BCE), Amasis was able to defeat an invasion of Egypt by the Babylonians under [[Nebuchadnezzar II]]; henceforth, the Babylonians experienced sufficient difficulties controlling their empire that they were forced to abandon future attacks against Amasis. < ref > {{cite book |first=Alan B. |last=Lloyd |chapter=The Late Period |title=The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt |editor-first=Ian |editor-last=Shaw |editor-link=Ian Shaw (Egyptologist) |publisher=Oxford Univ.

He was buried at the royal necropolis of Sais, and while his tomb has never been discovered, Herodotus describes it for us: \n \n {{quote|[It is] a great cloistered building of stone, decorated with pillars carved in the imitation of palm-trees, and other costly ornaments. Within the cloister is a chamber with double doors, and behind the doors stands the sepulchre. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/amasis.htm|title=Egypt: Amasis, the Last Great Egyptian Pharaoh|website=www.touregypt.net}} < /ref > }} \n \n Herodotus also relates the desecration of Ahmose II/Amasis' mummy when the Persian king [[Cambyses II|Cambyses]] conquered Egypt and thus ended the 26th (Saite) Dynasty: \n {{quote|[N]o sooner did [... Cambyses] enter the palace of Amasis that he gave orders for his [Amasis's] body to be taken from the tomb where it lay. This done, he proceeded to have it treated with every possible indignity, such as beating it with whips, sticking it with goads, and plucking its hairs. [...

He wears the traditional royal nemes head cloth, with a protective uraeus serpent at the brow. Circa 560 BCE. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]] \n From the fifth century BCE, there is evidence of stories circulating about Amasis, in Egyptian sources (including a demotic papyrus of the third century BCE), [[Herodotus]], [[Hellanicus of Lesbos|Hellanikos]], and [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Convivium Septem Sapientium]]''.
