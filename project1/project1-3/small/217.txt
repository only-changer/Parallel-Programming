He is a Professor at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]], [[IH\u00c9S]], [[Ohio State University]] and [[Vanderbilt University]]. He was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1982. \n \n ==Career== \n {{expand section|date=September 2020}} \n Connes was an Invited Professor at the [[Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers]] (2000). < ref > Alain Connes, \u00ab G\u00e9om\u00e9trie non-commutative \u00bb, ''Universit\u00e9 de tous les savoirs'', '''4''', 175-190, Editions Odile Jacob, 2001. < /ref > \n \n ===Research=== \n Alain Connes studies [[operator algebra]]s. In his early work on [[von Neumann algebra]]s in the 1970s, he succeeded in obtaining the almost complete classification of injective [[Von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]]s. He also formulated the [[Connes embedding problem]]. Following this, he made contributions in [[K-theory|operator K-theory]] and [[index theory]], which culminated in the [[Baum\u2013Connes conjecture]]. He also introduced [[cyclic homology|cyclic cohomology]] in the early 1980s as a first step in the study of [[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative differential geometry]].
