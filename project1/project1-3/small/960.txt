The author identifies and compares the formal powers of the president, prime minister, and parliament under the 1995 Constitution as well as the amendments introduced through the Constitutional referendum in 2005. Markarov argues that the highly presidentialized semi-presidential system that was introduced in the early 1990s gradually evolved into a Constitutionally more balanced structure. However, in practice, the president has remained dominant and backed by a presidential majority; the president has thus been able to set the policy agenda and implement his preferred policy. }} < /ref > \n \n ==History== \n Armenia became independent from the [[Russian Empire]] on 28 May 1918 as the ''Republic of Armenia'', later referred as [[First Republic of Armenia]]. About a month before its independence Armenia was part of short lived [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]]. Suffering heavy losses during the [[Turkish\u2013Armenian War|Turkish invasion of Armenia]] and after the [[Soviet invasion of Armenia]], the government of the First Republic resigned on 2 December 1920.  [[Soviet Russia]] reinstalled its control over the country, which later became part of the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]]. The TSFSR was dissolved in 1936 and Armenia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union known as the [[Armenian SSR]], later also referred as the ''Second Republic of Armenia''. \n \n During the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] the population of [[Armenia]] voted overwhelmingly for independence following the [[1991 Armenian independence referendum]]. It was followed by a presidential election in October 1991 that gave 83% of the votes to [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]]. Earlier in 1990, when the [[National Democratic Union of Armenia|National Democratic Union party]] defeated the [[Armenian Communist Party]], he was elected Chairman of the Supreme Council of Armenia. Ter-Petrosyan was re-elected in 1996. Following public discontent and demonstrations against his policies on [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Nagorno-Karabakh]], the President resigned in January 1998 and was replaced by Prime Minister [[Robert Kocharyan]], who was elected as second President in March 1998. Following the [[1999 Armenian parliament shooting|assassination]] of Prime Minister [[Vazgen Sargsyan]], parliament Speaker [[Karen Demirchyan]] and six other officials during parliament seating on 27 October 1999, a period of political instability ensued during which an opposition headed by elements of the former Armenian National Movement government attempted unsuccessfully to force Kocharyan to resign. In May 2000, [[Andranik Margaryan]] replaced [[Aram Sargsyan]] (a brother of assassinated [[Vazgen Sargsyan]]) as Prime Minister. \n \n Kocharyan's re-election as president in 2003 was followed by widespread allegations of ballot-rigging. He went on to propose controversial constitutional amendments on the role of [[National Assembly of Armenia|parliament]]. These were rejected in a referendum the following May. Concurrent parliamentary elections left Kocharyan's party in a very powerful position in the [[National Assembly of Armenia|parliament]]. There were mounting calls for the President's resignation in early 2004 with thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets in support of demands for a referendum of confidence in him. \n \n The Government of Armenia's stated aim is to build a [[Western world|Western-style]] [[parliamentary democracy]]. However, international observers have questioned the fairness of Armenia's parliamentary and presidential elections and constitutional referendum between 1995 and 2018, citing polling deficiencies, lack of cooperation by the [[Electoral Commission (Armenia)|Electoral Commission]], and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places. Armenia is considered one of the most democratic nations of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. \n \n The observance of [[human rights]] in Armenia is uneven and is marked by shortcomings. [[Police brutality]] allegedly still goes largely unreported, while observers note that defendants are often beaten to extract confessions and are denied visits from relatives and lawyers. Public demonstrations usually take place without government interference, though one rally in November 2000 by an opposition party was followed by the arrest and imprisonment for a month of its organizer. Freedom of religion is not always protected under existing law. Nontraditional churches, especially the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], have been subjected to harassment, sometimes violently. All churches apart from the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] must register with the government, and proselytizing was forbidden by law, though since 1997 the government has pursued more moderate policies. The government's policy toward conscientious objection is in transition, as part of Armenia's accession to the [[Council of Europe]]. \n \n Armenia boasts a good record on the protection of [[national minorities]], for whose representatives ([[Assyrians in Armenia|Assyrians]], [[Kurds]], [[Russians in Armenia|Russians]] and [[Yazidis in Armenia|Yazidis]]) four seats are reserved in the [[National Assembly of Armenia|National Assembly]]. The government does not restrict internal or international travel. \n \n ===Transition to a parliamentary republic=== \n In December 2015, the country [[Armenian constitutional referendum, 2015|held a referendum]] which approved transformation of Armenia from a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] to a [[parliamentary republic]]. < ref name=  \" controlrisks.com \" > {{cite web|url= https://www.controlrisks.com/en/newsletters/russia-cis-riskwatch/issue-9/armenia-a-gateway-for-iranian-goods |title= Armenia a gateway for Iranian goods? |last=Ayriyan|first=Serine| publisher = ControlRisks | work = Russia/CIS Riskwatch | issue = 9|date=April 2016 |access-date=20 April 2016}} < /ref > \n \n As a result, the president was stripped of his [[Veto#presidential veto|veto faculty]] < ref > {{Cite web|title=New constitution, old faces in Armenia|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/new-constitution-old-faces-in-armenia/|access-date=2021-04-03|website=openDemocracy|language=en}} < /ref >  and the presidency was downgraded to a figurehead position elected by parliament every seven years.
