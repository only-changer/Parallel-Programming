The first theory, the [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory]], was supported by such thinkers as [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]], who believed that sight worked by the [[eye]] emitting [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]]. The second theory, the [[intromission theory]] supported by [[Aristotle]] and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Previous Islamic writers (such as [[al-Kindi]]) had argued essentially on Euclidean, Galenist, or Aristotelian lines. The strongest influence on the ''Book of Optics'' was from Ptolemy's [[Ptolemy#Optics|''Optics'']], while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen's account. < ref > {{harvnb|Smith|2001|p=lxxix}}. < /ref >  Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid, the medical tradition of [[Galen]], and the intromission theories of Aristotle. Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-Kindi (and broke with Aristotle) in asserting that  \" from each point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point \" . < ref name= \" {{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}. \" > {{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=73}}. < /ref >  This however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation; in particular, every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye. What Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye. < ref name= \" {{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}. \" / >  He attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object\u2014for any one point on the eye, only the ray that reached it directly, without being refracted by any other part of the eye, would be perceived. He argued, using a physical analogy, that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays: in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board, whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off, perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays, and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye. As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point, and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone, this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye; if only the perpendicular ray mattered, then he had a one-to-one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved. < ref > {{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=74}} < /ref >  He later asserted (in book seven of the ''Optics'') that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived ''as if'' perpendicular. < ref > {{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=76}} < /ref > \n \n His arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why ''only'' perpendicular rays were perceived; why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly? < ref > {{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=75}} < /ref >  His later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive. < ref > {{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|pages=76\u201378}} < /ref >  However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was enormously influential, particularly in Western Europe.

It comprises drawing lines from two points in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of a circle meeting at a point on the [[circumference]] and making equal angles with the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular [[billiard table]] at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem,  \" Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer. \"  This leads to an [[Quartic equation|equation of the fourth degree]]. < ref > \n {{harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|1999}}, {{harvnb|Weisstein|2008}}. < /ref >  This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of [[fourth power]]s, where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated. His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an [[Integral|integration]], where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a [[paraboloid]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Katz|1995|pp=165\u201369, 173\u201374}}. < /ref >  Alhazen eventually solved the problem using [[conic section]]s and a geometric proof.

He conducted experiments with [[projectile]]s and concluded that only the impact of [[perpendicular]] projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate, whereas surfaces tended to deflect [[Oblique angle|oblique]] projectile strikes. For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not. < ref > {{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=695}}. < /ref >  He also used this result to explain how intense, direct light hurts the eye, using a mechanical analogy: Alhazen associated 'strong' lights with perpendicular rays and 'weak' lights with oblique ones.

Alhazen argued against Ptolemy's refraction theory, and defined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects, so the Moon appears close. The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance. Therefore, the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky, and further and larger on the horizon. Through works by [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Pecham]] and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with the refraction theory being rejected in the 17th century. < ref > {{harvnb|Hershenson|1989|pp=9\u201310}}. < /ref >  Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation, he was not the first author to offer it. [[Cleomedes]] ({{circa}} 2nd century) gave this account (in addition to refraction), and he credited it to [[Posidonius]] ({{circa}} 135\u201350 BCE). < ref > {{harvnb|Ross|2000}}. < /ref >  Ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his ''Optics'', but the text is obscure. < ref > {{harvnb|Ross|Ross|1976}}. < /ref >  Alhazen's writings were more widely available in the Middle Ages than those of these earlier authors, and that probably explains why Alhazen received the credit. \n \n == Other works on physics == \n \n === Optical treatises < !--Linked from [[Treatise on Light]]-- >  === \n \n Besides the ''Book of Optics'', Alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject, including his ''Risala fi l-Daw''' (''Treatise on Light'').

The suggestion of mechanical models for the Earth centred [[Ptolemaic model]]  \" greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the Ptolemaic system among the Christians of the West \" .

Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets, whereas the ''Hypotheses'' concerned what Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets. Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error, but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy's works. < ref name= \" {{harvnb|sabra|1998}}. \" > {{harvnb|Sabra|1998}}. < /ref >  He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy, especially the [[equant]], failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion, and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles: < ref > {{harvnb|Langermann|1990|pp=8\u201310}} < /ref > \n \n {{quote|Ptolemy assumed an arrangement (''hay'a'') that cannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist...

Alhazen believed there was a  \" true configuration \"  of the planets that Ptolemy had failed to grasp. He intended to complete and repair Ptolemy's system, not to replace it completely. < ref name= \" {{harvnb|sabra|1998}}. \" / >  In the ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' Alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories: \n \n {{quote|Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error... < ref name= \" {{harvnb|sabra|1989}}. \" / > }} \n \n He held that the criticism of existing theories\u2014which dominated this book\u2014holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge. \n \n === ''Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' === \n \n Alhazen's ''The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' was written {{circa}} 1038. Only one damaged manuscript has been found, with only the introduction and the first section, on the theory of planetary motion, surviving. (There was also a second section on astronomical calculation, and a third section, on astronomical instruments.) Following on from his ''Doubts on Ptolemy'', Alhazen described a new, geometry-based planetary model, describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry, infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry. He kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular, which required the inclusion of [[epicycles]] to explain observed motion, but he managed to eliminate Ptolemy's [[equant]]. In general, his model didn't try to provide a causal explanation of the motions, but concentrated on providing a complete, geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model. < ref > {{harvnb|Rashed|2007}}. < /ref > \n \n === Other astronomical works === \n \n Alhazen wrote a total of twenty-five astronomical works, some concerning technical issues such as ''Exact Determination of the Meridian'', a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation, a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the [[Milky Way]]; Alhazen made the first systematic effort of evaluating the Milky Way's parallax, combining Ptolemy's data and his own. He concluded that the parallax is (probably very much) smaller than Lunar parallax, and the Milky way should be a celestial object.
