But he had many enemies at home; in 393 he was driven out by the [[Illyria]]ns, but in the following year, with the aid of the [[Thessalia]]ns, he recovered his kingdom. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" > {{EB1911|wstitle=Amyntas II|inline=y|volume=1|pages=900-901}} < /ref >  Medius, head of the house of the [[Aleuadae]] of [[Larissa]], is believed to have provided aid to Amyntas in recovering his throne.  The mutual relationship between the [[Argead dynasty|Argeadae]] and the Aleuadae dates to the time of Archelaus. \n \n To shore up his country against the threat of the Illyrians, Amyntas established an alliance with the [[Chalkidian League]] led by [[Olynthus]].  In exchange for this support, Amyntas granted them rights to Macedonian timber, which was sent back to Athens to help fortify their fleet. < ref name= \" :0 \" > {{Cite book|title=Antigonus the One-Eyed|last=Champion, Jeff|isbn=978-1-4738-4036-2|location=Barnsley|pages=Chapter I|oclc=894227661}} < /ref >  With [[money]] flowing into Olynthus from these exports, their power grew. In response, Amyntas sought additional allies. He established connections with [[Cotys I (Odrysian)|Kotys]], chief of the [[Odrysians]]. Kotys had already married his daughter to the Athenian general [[Iphicrates]].  Prevented from marrying into Kotys' family, Amyntas soon adopted Iphicrates as his son. \n \n After the King's Peace of 387 BC, [[History of Sparta|Sparta]] was anxious to re-establish its presence in northern Greece.  In 385 BC, [[Bardylis]] and his [[Illyrians]] attacked [[Epirus]] instigated and aided by [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]], < ref > ''A History of Greece to 322 B.C.'' by N. G. L.

When Amyntas sought Spartan aid against the growing threat of Olynthus, the Spartans eagerly responded.  That Olynthus was backed by Athens and Thebes, rivals to Sparta for the control of Greece, provided them with an additional incentive to break up this growing power in the north.  Amyntas thus concluded a treaty with the Spartans, who assisted him in a war against [[Olynthus]].  First it Spartan-Macedonian forces suffered two defeats but in 379 they managed to destroy Olynthus. < ref name= \" :0 \"  / >   He also entered into a league with [[Jason of Pherae]], and assiduously cultivated the friendship of [[Athens]]. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  In 371 BC at a Panhellenic congress of the [[Lacedaemonian]] allies, he voted in support of the [[Athenians]]' claim and joined other Greeks in voting to help Athens to recover possession of [[Amphipolis]]. < ref > [[Aeschines]] - On the Embassy [http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/aeschines-embassy.html 2.32] < /ref > < ref > ''[https://archive.org/details/historygreeceil03grotgoog/page/n568  < !-- pg=336 quote=371 BC Amyntas Amphipolis. -- >  A history of Greece]'' by George Grote < /ref > \n \n With Olynthus defeated, Amyntas was now able to conclude a treaty with Athens and keep the timber revenues for himself. Amyntas shipped the timber to the house of the Athenian [[Timotheus (general)|Timotheus]], in [[Piraeus]]. \n \n == Family == \n \n Amyntas married first [[Eurydice I of Macedon|Eurydice]], daughter of [[Sirras|Sirras of Lynkestis]], in 390 BC. < ref name= \" women_macedonia \" > {{cite book|last1=Carney|first1=Elizabeth|title=Women and Monarchy in Macedonia|date=2000|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0-8061-3212-4}} < /ref >  By her, Amyntas had three sons, all of whom became kings of Macedonia one after the other, and a daughter: \n *[[Alexander II of Macedon|Alexander II]] (384 - 367 BC), succeeded his father. \n *[[Perdiccas III of Macedon|Perdiccas III]] (383 - 360 BC), succeeded his brother. \n *[[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]],father of [[Alexander the Great]], deposed his nephew [[Amyntas IV]].  \n *Eurynoe: According to Roman historian [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], Eurynoe prevented Amyntas' assassination by her mother and her husband (thought to be [[Ptolemy of Aloros]]), who was also her mother's lover, by revealing the plan to her father. She is not referred again by any other source. < ref name= \" women_macedonia \"  / >  Amyntas divorced her in 379 BC. \n \n Justin also mentions that Amyntas had three sons by his second wife, Gygaea. She was the daughter of [[Archelaus I]] and thus Amyntas's 2nd cousin. To make peace with [[Argaeus II]], Amyntas's 2nd cousin-once-removed, Amyntas chose to marry Gygaea because she was the aunt of Argaeus but to do so he had to divorce Eurydice. Eurydice and her children considered the divorce to be against the permission of the gods because they considered the reason illegitimate. As a result, they considered Amyntas to have commited adultery.Archelaus, Arrhidaeus and [[Menelaus (son of Amyntas III)|Menelaus]]. The fact that they did not try to take the throne before the 350s suggests that they were younger than Amyntas' children by Eurydice. They were ultimately eliminated by their half-brother Philip II because they had a claim to the throne. < ref name= \" women_macedonia \"  / > \n \n Amyntas died at an advanced age, leaving his throne to his eldest son, Alexander II. \n \n ==See also== \n *[[Treaties between Amyntas III and the Chalcidians]] \n \n ==Notes== \n {{reflist}} \n \n ==References== \n * Duane A.
