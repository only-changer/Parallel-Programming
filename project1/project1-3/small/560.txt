Before 1953, annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors. After 1953, more films were produced, many of them by young directors. The [[Khrushchev Thaw]] relaxed Soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of European and North American literature, films and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of the [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealists]], [[French New Wave]], and of directors such as [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]], [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]], [[Robert Bresson|Bresson]], [[Andrzej Wajda|Wajda]] (whose film ''[[Ashes and Diamonds (film)|Ashes and Diamonds]]'' influenced Tarkovsky) and [[Kenji Mizoguchi|Mizoguchi]]. \n \n Tarkovsky's teacher and mentor was [[Mikhail Romm]], who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors. In 1956 Tarkovsky directed his first student short film, ''[[The Killers (1956 film)|The Killers]]'', from a short story of [[Ernest Hemingway]]. The longer television film ''[[There Will Be No Leave Today]]'' followed in 1959. Both films were a collaboration between the VGIK students. Classmate [[Aleksandr Gordon]], who married Tarkovsky's sister, in particular directed, wrote, edited, and acted in the two films with Tarkovsky. \n \n An important influence on Tarkovsky was the film director [[Grigory Chukhray]], who was teaching at the VGIK. Impressed by the talent of his student, Chukhray offered Tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film ''Clear Skies''. Tarkovsky initially showed interest but then decided to concentrate on his studies and his own projects. < ref name=kompravda/ > \n \n During his third year at the VGIK, Tarkovsky met [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. They found much in common as they liked the same film directors and shared ideas on cinema and films. In 1959 they wrote the script ''Antarctica \u2013 Distant Country'', which was later published in the ''[[Moskovsky Komsomolets]]''. Tarkovsky submitted the script to [[Lenfilm]], but it was rejected. They were more successful with the script ''[[The Steamroller and the Violin]]'', which they sold to [[Mosfilm]]. This became Tarkovsky's graduation project, earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning First Prize at the New York Student Film Festival in 1961. \n \n ===Film career in the Soviet Union=== \n Tarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962. He had inherited the film from director Eduard Abalov, who had to abort the project. The film earned Tarkovsky international acclaim and won the [[Golden Lion]] award at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in the year 1962. In the same year, on 30 September, his first son Arseny (called Senka in Tarkovsky's diaries) Tarkovsky was born. \n [[File:Tarkovsky vgik.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Monument to Andrei Tarkovsky at entrance of [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]]]] \n In 1965, he directed the film ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' about the life of [[Andrei Rublev]], the fifteenth-century Russian [[iconography|icon painter]]. ''Andrei Rublev'' was not, except for a single screening in Moscow in 1966, immediately released after completion due to problems with Soviet authorities. Tarkovsky had to cut the film several times, resulting in several different versions of varying lengths. The film was widely released in the Soviet Union in a cut version in 1971. Nevertheless, the film had a budget of more than 1 million rubles \u2013 a significant sum for that period. < ref name=latgale > {{cite web |url=https://latgale.academy/censorships-impact-on-tarkovskys-movies/ |title=Censorship's impact on Tarkovsky's movies |access-date=26 July 2019 |work=latgale.academy}} < /ref >  A version of the film was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1969 and won the [[International Federation of Film Critics|FIPRESCI prize]]. \n \n He divorced his wife, Irina, in June 1970. In the same year, he married [[Larisa Tarkovskaya|Larisa Kizilova]] (n\u00e9e Egorkina), who had been a production assistant for the film ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' (they had been living together since 1965). Their son, Andrei Andreyevich Tarkovsky, (nicknamed Andriosha, meaning  \" little Andre \"  or  \" Andre Junior \" ) was born in the same year on 7 August.{{sfn|Gianvito|2006|page=xxv}} \n \n In 1972, he completed ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'', an adaptation of the novel ''[[Solaris (novel)|Solaris]]'' by [[Stanis\u0142aw Lem]]. He had worked on this together with screenwriter [[Friedrich Gorenstein]] as early as 1968. The film was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Sp\u00e9cial du Jury]], and was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]]. \n \n From 1973 to 1974, he shot the film ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'', a highly autobiographical and unconventionally structured film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his father's poems. In this film Tarkovsky portrayed the plight of childhood affected by war. Tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967, under the consecutive titles ''Confession'', ''White day'' and ''A white, white day''. From the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature. Soviet authorities placed the film in the  \" third category \" , a severely limited distribution, and only allowed it to be shown in third-class cinemas and workers' clubs. Few prints were made and the film-makers received no returns. Third category films also placed the film-makers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds, which could have serious effects on their future productivity. < ref > Marshall, Herbert. ''Sight and Sound''. Vol 45, no 2. Spring 1976. p. 93. < /ref >  These difficulties are presumed to have made Tarkovsky play with the idea of going abroad and producing a film outside the Soviet film industry. < ref > {{cite book |last=Tarkovsky |first=Andrei |author2=translated by Kitty Hunter-Blair |title=Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970-1986 |publisher=Seagull Books |year=1991 |location=[[Calcutta]] |isbn=978-81-7046-083-1|title-link=Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970-1986}} < /ref > \n \n During 1975, Tarkovsky also worked on the screenplay ''[[Hoffmanniana]]'', about the German writer and poet [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]. In December 1976, he directed ''[[Hamlet]]'', his only stage play, at the [[Lenkom Theatre]] in Moscow. The main role was played by [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]], who also acted in several of Tarkovsky's films. At the end of 1978, he also wrote the screenplay ''Sardor'' together with the writer Aleksandr Misharin. \n \n The last film Tarkovsky completed in the Soviet Union was ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'', inspired by the novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]'' by the brothers [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]]. Tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986. Initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel ''[[Dead Mountaineer's Hotel]]'' and he developed a raw script. Influenced by a discussion with Arkady Strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on ''Roadside Picnic''. Work on this film began in 1976. The production was mired in troubles; improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots. Tarkovsky's relationship with cinematographer [[Georgy Rerberg]] deteriorated to the point where he hired [[Alexander Knyazhinsky]] as a new first cinematographer. Furthermore, Tarkovsky suffered a heart attack in April 1978, resulting in further delay. The film was completed in 1979 and won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. In a question and answer session at the [[Edinburgh Filmhouse]] on 11 February 1981, Tarkovsky trenchantly rejected suggestions that the film was either impenetrably mysterious or a political [[allegory]]. < ref > ''Stalker: Andrei Tarkovsky Talking'', in Bold, Christine (ed.), ''[[Cencrastus]]'' No. 5, Summer 1981, pp. 12  &  13 < /ref > \n \n In 1979 Tarkovsky began production of the film ''The First Day'' (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c ''Pervyj Dyen''), based on a script by his friend and long-term collaborator [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. The film was set in 18th-century Russia during the reign of [[Peter the Great]] and starred [[Natalya Bondarchuk]] and [[Anatoli Papanov]]. To get the project approved by [[State Committee for Cinematography|Goskino]], Tarkovsky submitted a script that was different from the original script, omitting several scenes that were critical of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|official atheism in the Soviet Union]]. After shooting roughly half of the film the project was stopped by Goskino after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the censors. Tarkovsky was reportedly infuriated by this interruption and destroyed most of the film. < ref name=ReferenceB > {{cite book|script-title=ru:\u041c\u0438\u0440 \u0438 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u044b \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u044f \u0422\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e. \u0421\u043e\u0441\u0442. \u0410. \u0421\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043b\u0435\u0440. |trans-title=Andey Tarkovsky's world and films |publisher=Iskusstvo(\u0418\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e) |year=1990 |location=Moscow |isbn=978-81-7046-083-1 |language=ru}} < /ref > \n \n ===Film career outside the Soviet Union=== \n During the summer of 1979, Tarkovsky traveled to Italy, where he shot the documentary ''[[Voyage in Time]]'' together with his long-time friend [[Tonino Guerra]].

It was finally shot in 1985 in Sweden, with many of the crew being alumni from [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s films, including cinematographer [[Sven Nykvist]]. Tarkovsky's vision of his film was greatly influenced by Bergman's style. \n \n While ''The Sacrifice'' is about an apocaplypse and impending death, faith, and possible redemption, in the making-of documentary ''Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky'', in a particularly poignant scene, writer/director [[Michal Leszczylowski]] follows Tarkovsky on a walk as he expresses his sentiments on death \u2014 he claims himself to be immortal and has no fear of dying. Ironically, at the end of the year Tarkovsky was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. In January 1986, he began treatment in Paris and was joined there by his son, Andre Jr, who was finally allowed to leave the Soviet Union.

His teacher and mentor at the film school, [[Mikhail Romm]], allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director. \n \n Tarkovsky was, according to fellow student Shavkat Abdusalmov, fascinated by Japanese films.

The reason is that Tarkovsky saw film as an art as only a relatively recent phenomenon, with the early film-making forming only a prelude. The list has also no films or directors from Tarkovsky's native Russia, although he rated Soviet directors such as [[Boris Barnet]], [[Sergei Parajanov]] and [[Alexander Dovzhenko]] highly. He said of Dovzhenko's ''[[Earth (1930 film)|Earth]]'':  \" I have lived a lot among very simple farmers and met extraordinary people. They spread calmness, had such tact, they conveyed a feeling of dignity and displayed wisdom that I have seldom come across on such a scale.

Dovzhenko understood this. \" {{sfn|Gianvito|2006|p=42\u201343}} \n \n Andrei Tarkovsky was not a fan of science fiction, largely dismissing it for its  \" comic book \"  trappings and vulgar commercialism. < ref name=bfi/ >  However, in a famous exception Tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film ''[[The Terminator]]'', saying that its  \" vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art \" . He was critical of the  \" brutality and low acting skills \" , but was nevertheless impressed by the film. < ref name=ReferenceB/ > \n \n ==Cinematic style== \n In a 1962 interview, Tarkovsky argued:  \" All art, of course, is intellectual, but for me, all the arts, and cinema even more so, must above all be emotional and act upon the heart. \" {{sfn|Gianvito|2006|p=5}} His films are characterized by [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, extremely [[long take]]s, and images often considered by critics to be of exceptional beauty. Recurring motifs are dreams, memory, childhood, running water accompanied by fire, rain indoors, reflections, levitation, and characters re-appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera. He once said:  \" Juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless, collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away, relating a person to the whole world, that is the meaning of cinema. \" \n \n Tarkovsky incorporated levitation scenes into several of his films, most notably ''Solaris''.

By this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it. Unedited movie footage transcribes time in [[Real time (media)|real time]]. By using long takes and few cuts in his films, he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing, time lost, and the relationship of one moment in time to another. \n \n Up to, and including, his film ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'', Tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory. After ''Mirror'', he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the [[Classical unities|dramatic unities]] proposed by [[Aristotle]]: a concentrated action, happening in one place, within the span of a single day. \n \n Several of Tarkovsky's films have color or black-and-white sequences. This first occurs in the otherwise monochrome ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'', which features a color epilogue of [[Andrei Rublev|Rublev's]] authentic religious icon paintings. All of his films afterwards contain monochrome, and in ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker's]]'' case [[Photographic print toning|sepia]] sequences, while otherwise being in color. In 1966, in an interview conducted shortly after finishing ''Andrei Rublev'', Tarkovsky dismissed color film as a  \" commercial gimmick \"  and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color. He claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time, and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments, but not all the time, as this distracts the viewer. To him, films in color were like moving paintings or photographs, which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life. < ref > {{cite journal |last=Chugunova |first=Maria |title=On Cinema \u2013 Interview with Tarkovsky |journal=To the Screen |date=December 1966 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Color.html |access-date=14 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527083703/http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Color.html |archive-date=27 May 2009 |url-status=dead}} < /ref > \n \n ===Bergman on Tarkovsky=== \n [[Ingmar Bergman]], a renowned director, commented on Tarkovsky: < ref > {{Cite web |url=http://nostalghia.com/ |title=An Andrei Tarkovsky Information Site |last=Bielawski |first=Trond Trondsen and Jan |website=nostalghia.com |access-date=11 March 2018}} < /ref > \n {{Quote \n |text=My discovery of Tarkovsky's first film was like a miracle.

Furthermore, he directed the play ''[[Hamlet]]'' for the stage in Moscow, directed the opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' in London, and he directed a radio production of the short story ''Turnabout'' by [[William Faulkner]]. He also wrote ''[[Sculpting in Time]]'', a book on film theory. \n \n Tarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962. He then directed ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' in 1966, ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' in 1972, ''[[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'' in 1975 and ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'' in 1979. The documentary ''[[Voyage in Time]]'' was produced in Italy in 1982, as was ''[[Nostalghia]]'' in 1983. His last film ''[[The Sacrifice (1986 film)|The Sacrifice]]'' was produced in Sweden in 1986. Tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films, sometimes with a cowriter.

The screenplay is based on the life and work of German author [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]. In 1974 an acquaintance from [[Tallinnfilm]] approached Tarkovsky to write a screenplay on a German theme. Tarkovsky considered [[Thomas Mann]] and E. T. A. Hoffmann, and also thought about [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt]]''. In the end Tarkovsky signed a contract for a script based on the life and work of Hoffmann. He planned to write the script during the summer of 1974 at his [[dacha]]. Writing was not without difficulty, less than a month before the deadline he had not written a single page. He finally finished the project in late 1974 and submitted the final script to Tallinnfilm in October. < ref name=wpowell > {{cite book |last= Tarkovsky |first= Andrei |editor-first= William |editor-last= Powell |title= Collected Screenplays |publisher= Faber  &  Faber |location= London |year= 1999}} \n < /ref > \n \n Although the script was well received by the officials at Tallinnfilm, it was the consensus that no one but Tarkovsky would be able to direct it. The script was sent to [[State Committee for Cinematography|Goskino]] in February 1976, and although approval was granted for proceeding with making the film, the screenplay was never realized. In 1984, during the time of his exile in the West, Tarkovsky revisited the screenplay and made a few changes. He also considered to finally direct a film based on the screenplay but ultimately dropped this idea. < ref name=wpowell/ > \n \n ==Films about Tarkovsky== \n * ''[[Voyage in Time]]'' (1983): documents the travels in Italy of Andrei Tarkovsky in preparation for the making of his film ''Nostalghia'', [[Tonino Guerra]]. \n * ''Tarkovsky: A Poet in the Cinema'' (1984): directed by Donatella Baglivo. \n * Moscow Elegy (1987): a documentary/homage to Tarkovsky by Aleksandr Sokurov. \n * ''Auf der Suche nach der verlorenen Zeit'' (1988): Andrej Tarkowskijs Exil und Tod.
