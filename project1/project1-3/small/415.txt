In his early works he focused on technology and its impact, which he termed  \" [[information overload]]. \"  In 1970 his first major book about the future, ''[[Future Shock]]'', became a worldwide best-seller and has sold over 6 million copies. \n \n He and his wife Heidi Toffler, who collaborated with him for most of his writings, moved on to examining the reaction to [[Social change|changes in society]] with another best-selling book, ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler book)|The Third Wave]]'' in 1980. In it, he foresaw such technological advances as cloning, personal computers, the Internet, cable television and mobile communication. His later focus, via their other best-seller, ''Powershift'', (1990), was on the increasing power of 21st-century military hardware and the proliferation of new technologies. \n \n He founded Toffler Associates, a [[management consulting]] company, and was a visiting scholar at the [[Russell Sage Foundation]], visiting professor at [[Cornell University]], faculty member of the [[The New School|New School for Social Research]], a [[White House]] correspondent, and a business consultant. < ref name= \" MI \" > [http://www.milkeninstitute.org/events/events.taf?function=show & cat=allconf & EventID=GC03 & SPID=898 & level1=speakers & level2=bio  \" Alvin Toffler Speaker Biography \" ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927235248/http://www.milkeninstitute.org/events/events.taf?function=show & cat=allconf & EventID=GC03 & SPID=898 & level1=speakers & level2=bio |date=September 27, 2011 }}, [[Milken Institute]], 2003. < /ref >  Toffler's ideas and writings were a significant influence on the thinking of business and government leaders worldwide, including China's [[Zhao Ziyang]], and AOL founder [[Steve Case]]. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Gewirtz|first=Julian|date=February 2019|title=The Futurists of Beijing: Alvin Toffler, Zhao Ziyang, and China's  \" New Technological Revolution, \"  1979\u20131991|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-asian-studies/article/futurists-of-beijing-alvin-toffler-zhao-ziyang-and-chinas-new-technological-revolution-19791991/9C3A0A2BA1E1FEE714548E47FA351758|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|language=en|volume=78|issue=1|pages=115\u2013140|doi=10.1017/S0021911818002619|issn=0021-9118|doi-access=free}} < /ref > \n \n ==Early life== \n Alvin Toffler was born on October 4, 1928, in New York City, and raised in Brooklyn.
