Limb-bones resembling those of Macrotherium, but relatively stouter, have been described from the Pliocene beds of Attica and [[Samos]] as ''[[Ancylotherium]]''. In the Americas, the names ''Morothorium'' and ''[[Moropus]]'' have been applied to similar bones, in the belief that they indicated Xenarthrans. ''Macrotherium magnum'' must have been an animal of about nine feet in length. \n \n The [[South American]] genus ''[[Homalodotherium]]'' is sometimes placed in the Ancylopoda, but arguments against this have been given by Professor H. F. Osborn, who considers that the Ancylopoda are directly descended from the [[Condylarthra]]. \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist}} \n \n {{Taxonbar|from=Q837415}} \n \n [[Category:Chalicotheres]] \n [[Category:Eocene first appearances]] \n [[Category:Pleistocene extinctions]] \n \n \n {{paleo-oddtoedungulate-stub}}"
