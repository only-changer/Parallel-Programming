It is [[nocturnal]], resting in [[burrow]]s during the day and emerging at night to seek food. \n \n ==Taxonomy== \n The aardwolf is generally classified with the hyena family [[Hyaenidae]], though it was formerly placed in its own family Protelidae.{{refn|group=nb|Some sources such as Coetzee in Meester and Setzer (1977), K\u00f6hler and Ricardson (1990), and Yalden, Largen, and Koch (1980), classify the aardwolf in its own family still. < ref name=w1 > {{harvnb|Nowak|2005|pp=222\u2013223}} < /ref > }} Early on, scientists felt that it was merely mimicking the [[striped hyena]], which subsequently led to the creation of Protelidae. < ref > {{harvnb|Brottman|2012|pp=28\u201329}} < /ref >  Recent studies have suggested that the aardwolf probably diverged from other hyaenids early on; how early is still unclear, as the fossil record and genetic studies disagree by 10 million years. < ref name=koe > {{harvnb|Koepfli|Jenks|Eizirik|Zahirpour|2006|p=615}} < /ref > {{refn| group = nb |The fossil record shows 18\u201320 mya, and genetic studies indicate roughly 10.6 mya. < ref name=koe/ > }} \n \n The aardwolf is the only surviving species in the [[subfamily]] Protelinae.

It also has one or two diagonal stripes down the fore- and hind-quarters, along with several stripes on its legs. < ref name=mh33 > {{harvnb|Mills|Harvey|2001|p=33}} < /ref >  The mane is raised during confrontations to make the aardwolf appear larger. It is missing the throat spot that others in the family have. < ref name=ingo/ >  Its lower leg (from the knee down) is all black, and its tail is bushy with a black tip. < ref name=w1/ > \n \n [[File:Aardwolf Skull.JPG|thumb|Aardwolf skull]] \n The aardwolf is about {{convert|55|to|80|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, excluding its bushy tail, which is about {{convert|20|-|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, < ref name=EB > {{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=4}} < /ref > < ref name=w1/ >  and stands about {{convert|40|to|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulders. < ref name= \" Colliers \" > {{harvnb|Goodwin|1997|p=3}} < /ref >  An adult aardwolf weighs approximately {{convert|7|\u2013|10|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, sometimes reaching {{convert|15|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. < ref name=ingo > {{harvnb|Rieger|1990|pp=570\u2013571}} < /ref >  The aardwolves in the south of the continent tend to be smaller (about {{convert|10|kg|lb|abbr=on}})than the eastern version (around {{convert|14|kg|lb|abbr=on}}). This makes the aardwolf, the smallest extant member of the Hyaenidae family. < ref name=mh33/ >  The front feet have five toes each, unlike the four-toed hyena. < ref name=EB/ > < ref > {{harvnb|Brottman|2012|p=29}} < /ref >  The teeth and skull are similar to those of other hyenas, though smaller, < ref name=Colliers/ >  and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects. < ref name=EB/ >  It does still have canines, but, unlike other hyenas, these teeth are used primarily for fighting and defense. < ref name=w1/ >  Its ears, which are large, < ref name=w1/ >  are very similar to those of the striped hyena. < ref name=ingo/ > \n \n As an aardwolf ages, it will normally lose some of its teeth, though this has little impact on its feeding habits due to the softness of the insects that it eats. < ref name= \" wff \"  / > \n \n ==Distribution and habitat== \n Aardwolves live in open, dry plains and [[bushland]], avoiding mountainous areas. < ref name=w1/ >  Due to their specific food requirements, they are only found in regions where termites of the family [[Hodotermitidae]] occur. Termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed [[grassland]]s and [[savannah]]s, including [[arable land|farmland]]. For most of the year, aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens, which are occupied for six weeks at a time. < ref name= \" wff \"  / > \n \n There are two distinct populations: one in Southern Africa, and another in East and Northeast Africa. The species does not occur in the intermediary [[miombo]] forests. \n \n An adult pair, along with their most-recent offspring, occupies a territory of {{convert|1|-|4|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. < ref name=mh108 > {{harvnb|Mills|Harvey|2001|pp=108\u2013109}} < /ref > \n \n ==Behavior== \n [[Image:Aardwolf.jpg|thumb|left|Aardwolf at the [[San Antonio Zoo and Aquarium|San Antonio Zoo]]]] \n Aardwolves are shy and [[nocturnal animal|nocturnal]], sleeping in burrows by day. < ref name=EB/ >  They will, on occasion during the winter, become diurnal feeders. This happens during the coldest periods as they then stay in at night to conserve heat. < ref name=br30 > {{harvnb|Brottman|2012|p=30}} < /ref > \n \n They have often been mistaken for solitary animals. In fact, they live as [[monogamous pairing in animals|monogamous pairs]] with their young. < ref name= \" Richardson \" > Richardson, P. R.

If they are patrolling their territorial boundaries, the marking frequency increases drastically, to once every {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}}. At this rate, an individual may mark 60 marks per hour, < ref name=PKR/ >  and upwards of 200 per night. < ref name=mh108/ > \n \n An aardwolf pair may have up to 10 dens, and numerous feces [[Midden#Other definitions|midden]]s, within their territory. When they deposit excreta at their middens, they dig a small hole and cover it with sand. Their dens are usually abandoned [[aardvark]], [[springhare]], or [[Old World porcupine|porcupine]] dens, < ref name=br31 > {{harvnb|Brottman|2012|p=31}} < /ref >  or on occasion they are crevices in rocks. They will also dig their own dens, or enlarge dens started by [[springhare]]s. < ref name=PKR/ >  They typically will only use one or two dens at a time, rotating through all of their dens every six months. During the summer, they may rest outside their den during the night, and sleep underground during the heat of the day. \n \n Aardwolves are not fast runners nor are they particularly adept at fighting off predators. Therefore, when threatened, the aardwolf may attempt to mislead its foe by doubling back on its tracks. If confronted, it may raise its mane in an attempt to appear more menacing. It also emits a foul-smelling liquid from its anal glands. < ref name=Colliers/ > \n \n ===Feeding=== \n The aardwolf feeds primarily on termites and more specifically on ''[[Trinervitermes]]''. < ref name=mh71 > {{harvnb|Mills|Harvey|2001|p=71}} < /ref >  This genus of termites has different species throughout the aardwolf's range. In East Africa, they eat ''[[Trinervitermes bettonianus]]'', in central Africa, they eat ''[[Trinervitermes rhodesiensis]]'', and in southern Africa, they eat ''[[Trinervitermes trinervoides|T. trinervoides]]''. < ref name=EB/ > < ref name=mh71/ > < ref name=PKR > {{harvnb|Richardson|Bearder|1984|pp=158\u2013159}} < /ref >  Their technique consists of licking them off the ground as opposed to the [[aardvark]], which digs into the mound. < ref name=br30/ >  They locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites. < ref name=PKR/ >  An aardwolf may consume up to 250,000 [[termites]] per night using its long, sticky tongue. < ref name=mh71/ > < ref name= \" wff \"  / > \n \n They do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food. They often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months. < ref name=br31/ >  During certain seasonal events, such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of midwinter, the primary termites become scarce, so the need for other foods becomes pronounced. During these times, the southern aardwolf will seek out ''[[Hodotermes]] mossambicus'', a type of [[harvester termite]] < ref name=PKR/ >  active in the afternoon, which explains some of their diurnal behavior in the winter. < ref name=mh71/ >  The eastern aardwolf, during the rainy season, subsists on termites from the genera ''[[Odontotermes]]'' and ''[[Macrotermes]]''. < ref name=mh71/ >  They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, eggs, and, some sources say, occasionally small mammals and birds, but these constitute a very small percentage of their total diet. < ref name=PKR/ > \n \n Unlike other [[hyena]]s, aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals. < ref name=w1/ > < ref name=br31/ >  Contrary to popular myths, aardwolves do not eat carrion, and if they are seen eating while hunched over a dead carcass, they are actually eating larvae and beetles. < ref name=w1/ >  Also, contrary to some sources, they do not like meat, unless it is finely ground or cooked for them. < ref name=w1/ >  The adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups, < ref name=Colliers/ >  but more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers, < ref name=koel/ >  necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey. Their primary source, ''Trinervitermes'', forages in small but dense patches of {{convert|25|-|100|cm|in|abbr=on}}. < ref name=PKR/ >  While foraging, the aardwolf can cover about {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} per hour, which translates to {{convert|8|-|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} per summer night and {{convert|3|-|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} per winter night. < ref name=w1/ > \n \n ===Breeding=== \n The [[breeding season]] varies depending on location, but normally takes place during autumn or spring. In South Africa, breeding occurs in early July. < ref name=mh108/ >  During the breeding season, unpaired male aardwolves search their own territory, as well as others, for a female to mate with. Dominant males also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves, < ref name=mh108/ >  which can result in conflict between rival males. < ref name=ingo/ >  Dominant males even go a step further and as the breeding season approaches, they make increasingly greater and greater incursions onto weaker males' territories. As the female comes into [[oestrus]], they add pasting to their tricks inside of the other territories, sometimes doing so more in rivals' territories than their own. < ref name=mh108/ >  Females will also, when given the opportunity, mate with the dominant male, which increases the chances of the dominant male guarding  \" his \"  cubs with her. < ref name=mh108/ >  [[Copulation (zoology)|Copulation]] lasts between 1 and 4.5 hours. < ref name= \" Richardson \" / > < ref > Sliwa, Alexander.  \" [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander_Sliwa/publication/35640520_A_functional_analysis_of_scent_marking_and_mating_behaviour_in_the_aardwolf_Proteles_cristatus_Sparrman_1783/links/54edc8cd0cf272fc6d224e72.pdf A functional analysis of scent marking and mating behaviour in the aardwolf.] \"  Proteles cristatus (1996). < /ref > \n \n [[Gestation]] lasts between 89 and 92 days, < ref name=ingo/ > < ref name=mh108/ >  producing two to five [[List of animal names|cubs]] (most often two or three) during the rainy season (November\u2013December), < ref name=Colliers/ >  when termites are more active. < ref name=EB/ >  They are born with their eyes open, but initially are helpless, < ref name=PKR/ >  and weigh around {{convert|200|-|350|g|oz|abbr=on}}. < ref name=ingo/ >  The first six to eight weeks are spent in the [[Burrow|den]] with their parents. < ref name=br31/ >  The male may spend up to six hours a night watching over the cubs while the mother is out looking for food. < ref name=mh108/ > < ref name=PKR/ >  After three months, they begin supervised foraging, and by four months are normally independent, though they often share a den with their mother until the next breeding season. < ref name=br31/ >  By the time the next set of cubs is born, the older cubs have moved on. < ref name=mh108/ >  Aardwolves generally achieve [[sexual maturity]] at one and a half to two years of age. < ref name=ingo/ > \n \n ==Conservation== \n The aardwolf has not seen decreasing numbers and is relatively widespread throughout eastern Africa. They are not common throughout their range, as they maintain a density of no more than 1 per square kilometer, if food is abundant. Because of these factors, the IUCN has rated the aardwolf as [[least concern]]. < ref name= \" IUCN \" / >  In some areas, they are persecuted because of the mistaken belief that they prey on livestock; however, they are actually beneficial to the farmers because they eat termites that are detrimental. < ref name=PKR/ >  In other areas, the farmers have recognized this, but they are still killed, on occasion, for their fur. Dogs and insecticides < ref name= \" IUCN \" / >  are also common killers of the aardwolf. < ref name=br31/ > \n \n ==Interaction with humans== \n Aardwolves are rare sights at zoos.
