Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a [[serine]] residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme ([[Suicide inhibition]]). This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as [[diclofenac]] and [[ibuprofen]]), which are reversible inhibitors. \n \n Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of [[thromboxane A2|thromboxane A < sub > 2 < /sub > ]] in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8\u20139 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |title=Aspirin in heart attack and stroke prevention |access-date=8 May 2008 |publisher=American Heart Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331031146/http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |archive-date=31 March 2008 }} < /ref >  40{{nbsp}}mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A < sub > 2 < /sub >  release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition. < ref > {{cite journal | vauthors = Tohgi H, Konno S, Tamura K, Kimura B, Kawano K | title = Effects of low-to-high doses of aspirin on platelet aggregability and metabolites of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin | journal = Stroke | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 1400\u20133 | date = October 1992 | pmid = 1412574 | doi = 10.1161/01.STR.23.10.1400 | doi-access = free }} < /ref > \n \n Prostaglandins, local [[hormone]]s produced in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form [[clot|blood clots]]. Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention to prevent a second acute myocardial infarction. < ref name= \" pmid19482214 \"  / > \n \n ===COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition=== \n At least two different types of [[cyclooxygenase]]s, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 ([[Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2]]) produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. < ref > {{cite journal|vauthors=Goel A, Aggarwal S, Partap S, Saurabh A, Choudhary|date=2012|title=Pharmacokinetic solubility and dissolution profile of antiarrythmic drugs|url=|journal=Int J Pharma Prof Res|volume=3|issue=1|pages=592\u2013601|via=}} < /ref > {{vn|date=August 2016}} Newer NSAID drugs, [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. < ref name=COX2002/ > \n \n Several COX-2 inhibitors, such as [[rofecoxib]] (Vioxx), have been withdrawn from the market, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. < ref > {{cite journal | vauthors = Mart\u00ednez-Gonz\u00e1lez J, Badimon L | title = Mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of COX-inhibition: benefits and risks | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design | volume = 13 | issue = 22 | pages = 2215\u201327 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17691994 | doi = 10.2174/138161207781368774 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal | vauthors = Funk CD, FitzGerald GA | title = COX-2 inhibitors and cardiovascular risk | journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology | volume = 50 | issue = 5 | pages = 470\u20139 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18030055 | doi = 10.1097/FJC.0b013e318157f72d }} < /ref >  Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of [[PGI2]] is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors. \n \n Furthermore, aspirin, while inhibiting the ability of COX-2 to form pro-inflammatory products such as the [[prostaglandins]], converts this enzyme's activity from a prostaglandin-forming cyclooxygenase to a [[lipoxygenase]]-like enzyme: aspirin-treated COX-2 metabolizes a variety of [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]] to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to [[specialized proresolving mediators]] such as the aspirin-triggered [[lipoxin]]s, aspirin-triggered [[resolvins]], and aspirin-triggered [[maresin]]s. These mediators possess potent anti-inflammatory activity. It is proposed that this aspirin-triggered transition of COX-2 from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized proresolving mediators contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin. < ref name= \" pmid25895638 \" > {{cite journal | vauthors = Romano M, Cianci E, Simiele F, Recchiuti A | title = Lipoxins and aspirin-triggered lipoxins in resolution of inflammation | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 760 | pages = 49\u201363 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 25895638 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.03.083 }} < /ref > < ref name= \" pmid23747022 \" > {{cite journal | vauthors = Serhan CN, Chiang N | title = Resolution phase lipid mediators of inflammation: agonists of resolution | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 632\u201340 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23747022 | pmc = 3732499 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2013.05.012 }} < /ref > < ref name= \" pmid26546723 \" > {{cite journal | vauthors = Weylandt KH | title = Docosapentaenoic acid derived metabolites and mediators - The new world of lipid mediator medicine in a nutshell | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 785 | pages = 108\u2013115 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 26546723 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.11.002 }} < /ref > \n \n ===Additional mechanisms=== \n Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action.
