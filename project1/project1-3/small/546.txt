During the course of its history Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers, including the [[Hyksos]], the [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]], the [[Nubians]], the [[Assyria]]ns, the [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|Achaemenid Persians]], and the [[Macedon]]ians under the command of [[Alexander the Great]].

The predictable [[Flooding of the Nile|flooding]] and controlled [[irrigation]] of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and [[Social change|social development]] and culture.

Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite [[Egyptian writing|scribes]], religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a [[pharaoh]], who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religious beliefs]].{{sfnmp|1a1=James|1y=2005|1p=8|2a1=Manuelian|2y=1998|2pp=6\u20137}} \n \n The many achievements of the ancient Egyptians include the [[Stone quarries of ancient Egypt|quarrying]], [[surveying]] and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], [[Egyptian temple|temples]], and [[Obelisk making technology in ancient Egypt|obelisks]]; a system of [[Egyptian mathematics|mathematics]], a practical and effective [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|system of medicine]], irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques, the first known planked boats,{{sfnp|Ward|2001}} [[Egyptian faience]] and glass technology, new forms of [[Ancient Egyptian literature|literature]], and the [[Egyptian\u2013Hittite peace treaty|earliest known peace treaty]], made with the Hittites.{{sfnp|Clayton|1994|p=153}} Ancient Egypt has left a lasting legacy.

The third-century{{nbsp}}BC Egyptian priest [[Manetho]] grouped the long line of kings from [[Menes]] to his own time into 30 dynasties, a system still used today. He began his official history with the king named  \" Meni \"  (or Menes in Greek), who was believed to have united the two kingdoms of [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]].{{sfnp|Clayton|1994|p=6}} \n [[File:Narmer Palette.jpg|thumb|The [[Narmer Palette]] depicts the unification of the Two Lands.{{sfnp|Robins|2008|p=32}}]] \n The transition to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers represented, and there is no contemporary record of Menes. Some scholars now believe, however, that the mythical Menes may have been the king [[Narmer]], who is depicted wearing [[Regalia|royal regalia]] on the ceremonial ''Narmer Palette,'' in a symbolic act of unification.{{sfnp|Clayton|1994|pp=12\u201313}} In the Early Dynastic Period, which began about 3000{{nbsp}}BC, the first of the Dynastic kings solidified control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], from which he could control the [[labour force]] and agriculture of the fertile delta region, as well as the lucrative and critical [[trade route]]s to the [[Levant]]. The increasing power and wealth of the kings during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate [[mastaba]] tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos, which were used to celebrate the deified king after his death.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=70}} The strong institution of kingship developed by the kings served to legitimize state control over the land, labour, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/archaicegypt/info.html|title=Early Dynastic Egypt|date=2001 |website=Digital Egypt for Universities |publisher=University College London| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304143847/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/archaicegypt/info.html |archive-date= 4 March 2008 |url-status=live}} < /ref > \n \n ===Old Kingdom (2686\u20132181 BC)=== \n {{Main|Old Kingdom of Egypt}} \n Major advances in architecture, art, and technology were made during the [[Old Kingdom]], fueled by the increased [[agricultural productivity]] and resulting population, made possible by a well-developed central administration.{{sfnp|James|2005|p=40}} Some of ancient Egypt's crowning achievements, the [[Giza Necropolis|Giza pyramids]] and [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]], were constructed during the Old Kingdom. Under the direction of the [[vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]], state officials collected taxes, coordinated irrigation projects to improve [[crop yield]], drafted peasants to work on construction projects, and established a [[Criminal law|justice system]] to maintain peace and order.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=102}}  \n [[File:Scribe accroupi.png|thumb|The Seated Scribe, an Egyptian from the Old Kingdom. (4th\u20135th dynasty)]] \n [[File:Khafre statue.jpg|thumb|right|[[Khafre]] enthroned]] \n \n With the rising importance of central administration in Egypt, a new class of educated scribes and officials arose who were granted estates by the king in payment for their services. Kings also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the king after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic vitality of Egypt, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|pp=116\u2013117}} As the power of the kings diminished, regional governors called [[nomarch]]s began to challenge the supremacy of the office of king.

Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the king, used their new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richer\u2014which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=120}} In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the [[optimism]] and originality of the period.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=146}} \n \n Free from their loyalties to the king, local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and [[political power]]. By 2160{{nbsp}}BC, rulers in [[Herakleopolis]] controlled Lower Egypt in the north, while a rival clan based in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], the [[Intef I|Intef family]], took control of Upper Egypt in the south. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055{{nbsp}}BC the northern Theban forces under [[Mentuhotep II|Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II]] finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands. They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].{{sfnp|Clayton|1994|p=29}} \n \n ===Middle Kingdom (2134\u20131690 BC)=== \n {{Main|Middle Kingdom of Egypt}} \n [[File:Egypte louvre 231 visage.jpg|thumb|Amenemhat III, the last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom]] \n The kings of the Middle Kingdom restored the country's stability and prosperity, thereby stimulating a resurgence of art, literature, and monumental building projects.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=148}} Mentuhotep II and his [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]] successors ruled from Thebes, but the vizier [[Amenemhat I]], upon assuming the kingship at the beginning of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] around 1985{{nbsp}}BC, shifted the kingdom's capital to the city of [[Itjtawy]], located in [[Faiyum Oasis|Faiyum]].{{sfnp|Clayton|1994|p=79}} From Itjtawy, the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty undertook a far-sighted [[land reclamation]] and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region. Moreover, the military reconquered territory in [[Nubia]] that was rich in quarries and gold mines, while laborers built a defensive structure in the Eastern Delta, called the  \" [[Walls of the Ruler]] \" , to defend against foreign attack.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=158}} \n \n With the kings having secured the country militarily and politically and with vast agricultural and mineral wealth at their disposal, the nation's population, arts, and religion flourished. In contrast to elitist Old Kingdom attitudes towards the gods, the Middle Kingdom displayed an increase in expressions of personal piety.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|pp=179\u2013182}} Middle Kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident, eloquent style.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=146}} The [[relief]] and portrait sculpture of the period captured subtle, individual details that reached new heights of technical sophistication.{{sfnp|Robins|2008|p=90}} \n \n The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, [[Amenemhat III]], allowed [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-speaking [[Canaan]]ite settlers from the [[Near East]] into the Delta region to provide a sufficient labour force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and mining activities, however, combined with severe [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]] later in his reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties. During this decline, the Canaanite settlers began to assume greater control of the Delta region, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the [[Hyksos]].{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=188}} \n \n ===Second Intermediate Period (1674\u20131549 BC) and the Hyksos=== \n {{Main|Second Intermediate Period of Egypt}} \n Around 1785{{nbsp}}BC, as the power of the Middle Kingdom kings weakened, a [[Western Asia]]n people called the [[Hyksos]], who had already settled in the Delta, seized control of Egypt and established their capital at [[Avaris]], forcing the former central government to retreat to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. The king was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute.{{sfnp|Ryholt|1997|p=310}} The Hyksos ( \" foreign rulers \" ) retained Egyptian models of government and identified as kings, thereby integrating Egyptian elements into their culture. They and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt, most notably the [[composite bow]] and the horse-drawn [[chariot]].{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=189}} \n \n After retreating south, the native Theban kings found themselves trapped between the Canaanite Hyksos ruling the north and the Hyksos' [[Nubian people|Nubian]] allies, the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushites]], to the south. After years of vassalage, Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years, until 1555{{nbsp}}BC.{{sfnp|Ryholt|1997|p=310}} The kings [[Seqenenre Tao II]] and [[Kamose]] were ultimately able to defeat the [[Nubians]] to the south of Egypt, but failed to defeat the Hyksos. That task fell to Kamose's successor, [[Ahmose I]], who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos' presence in Egypt. He established a new dynasty and, in the New Kingdom that followed, the military became a central priority for the kings, who sought to expand Egypt's borders and attempted to gain mastery of the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]].{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=224}} \n \n ===New Kingdom (1549\u20131069 BC)=== \n {{Main|New Kingdom of Egypt}} \n [[File:Egypt NK edit.svg|upright|thumb|The maximum territorial extent of ancient Egypt (circa 1450 BC)]] \n The New Kingdom pharaohs established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbours, including the [[Mitanni]] Empire, [[Assyria]], and [[Canaan]]. Military campaigns waged under [[Thutmose I|Tuthmosis I]] and his grandson [[Thutmose III|Tuthmosis III]] extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen. Beginning with [[Merneptah]] the rulers of Egypt adopted the title of [[pharaoh]]. \n \n Between their reigns, [[Hatshepsut]], a queen who established herself as pharaoh, launched many building projects, including restoration of temples damaged by the Hyksos, and sent trading expeditions to [[Land of Punt|Punt]] and the Sinai.{{sfnp|Clayton|1994|pp=104\u2013107}} When Tuthmosis III died in 1425{{nbsp}}BC, Egypt had an empire extending from [[Niya (kingdom)|Niya]] in north west [[Syria]] to the [[Cataracts of the Nile|Fourth Cataract]] of the Nile in [[Nubia]], cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as [[bronze]] and [[wood]].{{sfnp|James|2005|p=48}} \n \n The New Kingdom pharaohs began a large-scale building campaign to promote the god [[Amun]], whose growing cult was based in [[Karnak]]. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements, both real and imagined. The Karnak temple is the largest Egyptian temple ever built.{{sfnp|Bleiberg|2005|}} \n \n Around 1350{{nbsp}}BC, the stability of the New Kingdom was threatened when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to [[Akhenaten]], he touted the previously obscure [[Solar deity|sun deity]] [[Aten]] as the [[God|supreme deity]], suppressed the worship of most other deities, and moved the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day [[Amarna]]).{{sfnp|Aldred|1988|p=259}} He was devoted to his new [[Atenism|religion]] and [[Amarna art|artistic style]]. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned and the traditional religious order restored.

After reviewing what the Egyptian texts have to say about 'the sea peoples', one Egyptologist (Wolfgang Helck) recently remarked that although some things are unclear,  \" eins ist aber sicher: Nach den agyptischen Texten haben wir es nicht mit einer 'Volkerwanderung' zu tun. \"  Thus the migration hypothesis is based not on the inscriptions themselves but on their interpretation. \" }} Initially, the military was able to [[Battle of Perire|repel]] these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern [[Canaan]], much of it falling to the Assyrians. The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery, and civil unrest.

Its foreign allies had fallen under the [[Assyria]]n sphere of influence, and by 700{{nbsp}}BC war between the two states became inevitable. Between 671 and 667{{nbsp}}BC the Assyrians began the [[Assyrian conquest of Egypt]]. The reigns of both [[Taharqa]] and his successor, [[Tantamani|Tanutamun]], were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians, against whom Egypt enjoyed several victories. Ultimately, the Assyrians pushed the Kushites back into Nubia, occupied Memphis, and [[Sack of Thebes|sacked the temples of Thebes]].{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=358}} \n \n ===Late Period (653\u2013332 BC)=== \n {{Main|Late Period of ancient Egypt|History of Persian Egypt}} \n \n The Assyrians left control of Egypt to a series of vassals who became known as the Saite kings of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-Sixth Dynasty]]. By 653{{nbsp}}BC, the Saite king [[Psamtik I]] was able to oust the Assyrians with the help of Greek mercenaries, who were recruited to form Egypt's first [[Ancient Egyptian navy|navy]]. [[Colonies in antiquity|Greek influence]] expanded greatly as the [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Naucratis|Naukratis]] became the home of Greeks in the Nile Delta. The Saite kings based in the new capital of [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]] witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture, but in 525{{nbsp}}BC, the powerful Persians, led by [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses II]], began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh [[Psamtik III]] at the [[Battle of Pelusium (343 BC)|Battle of Pelusium]]. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from Iran, leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy. A few successful revolts against the Persians marked the 5th century{{nbsp}}BC, but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=383}} \n \n Following its annexation by Persia, Egypt was joined with [[Cyprus]] and [[Phoenicia]] in the sixth [[satrap]]y of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]]. This first period of Persian rule over Egypt, also known as the [[Twenty-Seventh Dynasty]], ended in 402{{nbsp}}BC, when Egypt regained independence under a series of native dynasties. The last of these dynasties, the [[Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth]], proved to be the last native royal house of ancient Egypt, ending with the kingship of [[Nectanebo II]]. A brief restoration of Persian rule, sometimes known as the [[Achaemenid Empire|Thirty-First Dynasty]], began in 343{{nbsp}}BC, but shortly after, in 332{{nbsp}}BC, the Persian ruler Mazaces handed Egypt over to [[Alexander the Great]] without a fight.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=385}} \n \n ===Ptolemaic period (332\u201330 BC)=== \n {{Main|Ptolemaic Kingdom}} \n [[File:Ring with engraved portrait of Ptolemy VI Philometor (3rd\u20132nd century BCE) - 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]] wearing the [[Pschent|double crown of Egypt]]]] \n In 332{{nbsp}}BC, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Egypt with little resistance from the [[Persia]]ns and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer. The administration established by Alexander's successors, the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], was based on an Egyptian model and based in the new [[Capital (political)|capital city]] of [[Alexandria]]. The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule, and became a [[Seat of Wisdom|seat of learning]] and culture, centered at the famous [[Library of Alexandria]].{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=405}} The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city\u2014as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises, such as papyrus manufacturing, their top priority.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=411}} \n \n [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic culture]] did not supplant native Egyptian culture, as the Ptolemies supported time-honored traditions in an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace. They built new temples in Egyptian style, supported traditional cults, and portrayed themselves as pharaohs. Some traditions merged, as Greek and [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian gods]] were [[Syncretic religion|syncretized]] into composite deities, such as [[Serapis]], and [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] forms of sculpture influenced traditional Egyptian motifs. Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians, the Ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion, bitter family rivalries, and the powerful mob of Alexandria that formed after the death of [[Ptolemy IV Philopator|Ptolemy IV]].{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=418}} In addition, as [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] relied more heavily on imports of grain from Egypt, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] took great interest in the political situation in the country. Continued Egyptian revolts, ambitious politicians, and powerful opponents from the [[Near East]] made this situation unstable, leading Rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire.{{sfnp|James|2005|p=62}} \n \n ===Roman period (30 BC \u2013 AD 641)=== \n {{Main|Egypt (Roman province)}} \n [[File:Fayum-22.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.55|The [[Fayum mummy portraits]] epitomize the meeting of Egyptian and Roman cultures.]] \n Egypt became a province of the [[Roman Empire]] in 30{{nbsp}}BC, following the defeat of [[Mark Antony|Marc Antony]] and [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] Queen [[Cleopatra VII]] by [[Octavian]] (later [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] Augustus) in the [[Battle of Actium]]. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt, and the [[Roman legion|Roman army]], under the control of a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period.{{sfnp|James|2005|p=63}} Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=426}} \n \n Although the Romans had a more hostile attitude than the Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=422}} The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not to the extent that the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=422}} \n \n From the mid-first century AD, [[Christianity]] took root in Egypt and it was originally seen as another cult that could be accepted. However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian Religion]] and [[Greco-Roman]] religion and threatened popular religious traditions. This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of [[Diocletian]] starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=431}} In 391 the Christian Emperor [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples.{{sfnp|Chadwick|2001|p=373}} Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed.{{sfnp|MacMullen|1984|p=63}} As a consequence, Egypt's native religious culture was continually in decline. While the native population continued to speak [[Egyptian language|their language]], the ability to read [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to [[church (building)|churches]] or abandoned to the desert.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=445}} \n \n In the fourth century, as the Roman Empire divided, Egypt found itself in the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. In the waning years of the Empire, Egypt fell to the [[Sasanian Egypt|Sasanian Persian]] army in the [[Sasanian conquest of Egypt]] (618\u2013628). It was then recaptured by the Roman Emperor [[Heraclius]] (629\u2013639), and was finally captured by [[Rashidun Caliphate|Muslim Rashidun army]] in 639\u2013641, ending Roman rule. \n \n ==Government and economy== \n \n ===Administration and commerce=== \n [[File:Pharaoh with double crown.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|The pharaoh was usually depicted wearing symbols of royalty and power.]] \n \n The [[pharaoh]] was the absolute monarch of the country and, at least in theory, wielded complete control of the land and its resources. The king was the supreme [[Commander|military commander]] and head of the government, who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs. In charge of the administration was his second in command, the [[vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]], who acted as the king's representative and coordinated land surveys, the treasury, building projects, the legal system, and the [[archives]].{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|p=358}} At a regional level, the country was divided into as many as 42 administrative regions called [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] each governed by a [[nomarch]], who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction. The [[Egyptian temple|temples]] formed the backbone of the economy. Not only were they [[Place of worship|places of worship]], but were also responsible for collecting and storing the kingdom's wealth in a system of [[granary|granaries]] and treasuries administered by [[Supervisor|overseers]], who redistributed grain and goods.{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|p=363}} \n \n Much of the economy was centrally organized and strictly controlled. Although the ancient Egyptians did not use [[Currency|coinage]] until the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late period]], < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/digitalegypt/metal/coins.html|title=Egypt: Coins of the Ptolemies|website=Digital Egypt for Universities|publisher=University College London|date=2002}} < /ref >  they did use a type of money-barter system,{{sfnp|Meskell|2004|p=23}} with standard sacks of grain and the ''[[Deben (unit)|deben]]'', a weight of roughly {{convert|91|g|oz|0}} of copper or silver, forming a common denominator.{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|p=372}} Workers were paid in grain; a simple laborer might earn 5{{frac|2}} & nbsp;sacks (200 & nbsp;kg or 400 & nbsp;lb) of grain per month, while a foreman might earn 7{{frac|2}} & nbsp;sacks (250 & nbsp;kg or 550 & nbsp;lb). Prices were fixed across the country and recorded in lists to facilitate trading; for example a shirt cost five copper deben, while a cow cost 140{{nbsp}}deben.{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|p=372}} Grain could be traded for other goods, according to the fixed price list.{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|p=372}} During the fifth century{{nbsp}}BC coined money was introduced into Egypt from abroad. At first the coins were used as standardized pieces of [[precious metal]] rather than true money, but in the following centuries international traders came to rely on coinage.{{sfnp|Turner|1984|p=125}} \n \n ===Social status=== \n [[File:Relief of a Nobleman, ca. 1295-1070 B.C.E. 36.261.jpg|thumb|left|Painted limestone relief of a noble member of Ancient Egyptian society during the New Kingdom]] \n Egyptian society was highly stratified, and [[social status]] was expressly displayed. Farmers made up the bulk of the population, but agricultural produce was owned directly by the state, temple, or [[Nobility|noble family]] that owned the land.{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|p=383}} Farmers were also subject to a labor tax and were required to work on irrigation or construction projects in a [[corv\u00e9e]] system.{{sfnp|James|2005|p=136}} Artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers, but they were also under state control, working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury. Scribes and officials formed the upper class in ancient Egypt, known as the  \" white kilt class \"  in reference to the bleached linen garments that served as a mark of their rank.{{sfnp|Billard|1978|p=109}} The upper class prominently displayed their social status in art and literature. Below the nobility were the priests, physicians, and engineers with specialized training in their field.

Married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts, which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end. Compared with their counterparts in ancient Greece, Rome, and even more modern places around the world, ancient Egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices, legal rights, and opportunities for achievement. Women such as [[Hatshepsut]] and [[Cleopatra VII]] even became pharaohs, while others wielded power as [[God's Wife of Amun|Divine Wives of Amun]]. Despite these freedoms, [[Women in ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian women]] did not often take part in official roles in the administration, aside from the royal high priestesses, apparently served only secondary roles in the temples (not much data for many dynasties), and were not so likely to be as educated as men. < ref name=UCJohnson/ >   < !--- Moved reference about women and gender equality down to External Links -RoyGoldsmith, 4/9/12 --- > \n \n ===Legal system=== \n [[File:Louvre-antiquites-egyptiennes-p1020372 Cropped and bg reduced.png|thumb|left|upright|[[The Seated Scribe]] from [[Saqqara]], [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt]]; scribes were elite and well educated. They assessed taxes, kept records, and were responsible for administration.]] \n The head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh, who was responsible for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as [[Ma'at]].{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|p=358}} Although no [[legal code]]s from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. < ref name= \" UCJohnson \" / >  Local councils of elders, known as ''Kenbet'' in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes.{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|p=358}} More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the ''Great Kenbet'', over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.{{sfnp|Oakes|Gahlin|2003|p=472}} \n \n Punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or [[Impalement|impaling]] the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family.{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|p=358}} Beginning in the New Kingdom, [[oracle]]s played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a  \" yes \"  or  \" no \"  question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgement by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an [[ostracon]].{{sfnp|McDowell|1999|p=168}} \n \n ===Agriculture=== \n {{main|Ancient Egyptian agriculture}} {{see also|Gardens of ancient Egypt}} \n [[File:Tomb of Nakht (2).jpg|thumb|upright|A tomb relief depicts workers plowing the fields, harvesting the crops, and threshing the grain under the direction of an overseer, painting in the tomb of [[TT52|Nakht]].]] \n [[File:Rope stretching.jpg|thumb|left|Measuring and recording the harvest is shown in a wall painting in the tomb of [[TT69|Menna]], at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (Eighteenth Dynasty).]] \n \n A combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich [[fertile soil]] resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. [[Land management]] was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|p=361}} \n \n Farming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: ''[[Season of the Inundation|Akhet]]'' (flooding), ''[[Season of the Emergence|Peret]]'' (planting), and ''[[Season of the Harvest|Shemu]]'' (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the [[growing season]] lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops.{{sfnp|Nicholson|Shaw|2000|p=514}} From March to May, farmers used [[sickle]]s to harvest their crops, which were then [[Threshing|threshed]] with a [[flail]] to separate the straw from the grain. [[Winnowing]] removed the [[chaff]] from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.{{sfnp|Nicholson|Shaw|2000|p=506}} \n \n The ancient Egyptians cultivated [[emmer]] and [[barley]], and several other cereal grains, all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer.{{sfnp|Nicholson|Shaw|2000|p=510}} [[Flax]] plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of [[linen]] and to make clothing. [[Papyrus]] growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.{{sfnp|Nicholson|Shaw|2000|pp=577, 630}} \n \n ====Animals==== \n [[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Sennudem 001.jpg|thumb|left|Sennedjem plows his fields with a pair of oxen, used as beasts of burden and a source of food.]] \n The Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and [[animal]]s was an essential element of the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole.{{sfnp|Strouhal|1989|p=117}} Animals, both [[Domestication|domesticated]] and [[Wildlife|wild]], were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. [[Ancient Egyptian cattle|Cattle]] were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular [[Cattle count|censuses]], and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. [[Poultry]], such as ducks, geese, and pigeons, were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them.{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|p=381}} The Nile provided a plentiful source of [[fish]]. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and provided both honey and wax.{{sfnp|Nicholson|Shaw|2000|p=409}} \n \n The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and [[oxen]] as [[Working animal|beasts of burden]], and they were responsible for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil. The slaughter of a fattened ox was also a central part of an offering ritual. Horses were introduced by the [[Hyksos]] in the [[Second Intermediate Period]]. Camels, although known from the New Kingdom, were not used as beasts of burden until the Late Period. There is also evidence to suggest that [[North African elephant|elephants]] were briefly utilized in the Late Period but largely abandoned due to lack of [[grazing]] land.{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|p=381}} [[Cats in ancient Egypt|Cats]], dogs, and monkeys were common family pets, while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa, such as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n [[lion]]s,{{sfnp|Heptner|Sludskii|1992|pp=83\u201395}} were reserved for royalty. [[Herodotus]] observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses.{{sfnp|Strouhal|1989|p=117}} During the Late Period, the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular, such as the cat goddess [[Bastet (mythology)|Bastet]] and the ibis god [[Thoth]], and these animals were kept in large numbers for the purpose of ritual sacrifice.{{sfnp|Oakes|Gahlin|2003|p=229}} \n \n ===Natural resources=== \n {{Further|Mining industry of Egypt|Stone quarries of ancient Egypt}} \n Egypt is rich in building and decorative stone, copper and lead ores, gold, and semiprecious stones.

The [[Wadi Hammamat]] was a notable source of granite, [[greywacke]], and gold. [[Flint]] was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose.{{sfnp|Nicholson|Shaw|2000|p=28}} Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as [[sulfur]] as cosmetic substances.{{sfnp|Hogan |2011|loc= \" Sulphur \" }} \n \n The Egyptians worked deposits of the [[Lead|lead ore]] [[galena]] at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, plumb bobs, and small figurines.

Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period.{{sfnp|Nicholson|Shaw|2000|p=166}} High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the Eastern Desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], greywacke, [[alabaster]], and [[carnelian]] dotted the Eastern Desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty.

The phases of ancient Egyptian are [[Old Egyptian]], [[Middle Egyptian]] (Classical Egyptian), [[Late Egyptian]], [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]].{{sfnp|Loprieno|2004|p=161}} Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.{{sfnp|Loprieno|2004|p=162}} \n \n Ancient Egyptian was a [[synthetic language]], but it became more [[Analytic language|analytic]] later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite [[Article (grammar)|articles]], which replaced the older inflectional [[suffix]]es. There was a change from the older [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] [[word order]] to [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]].{{sfnp|Loprieno|1995b|pp=2137\u20132138}} The Egyptian [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]], [[hieratic]], and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic [[Coptic alphabet]]. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Orthodox Church]], and traces of it are found in modern [[Egyptian Arabic]].{{sfnp|Vittman|1991|pp=197\u2013227}} \n \n ===Sounds and grammar=== \n Ancient Egyptian has 25 consonants similar to those of other Afro-Asiatic languages. These include [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] and [[Emphatic consonant|emphatic]] consonants, voiced and voiceless stops, voiceless [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] and voiced and voiceless [[Affricate consonant|affricates]]. It has three long and three short vowels, which expanded in Late Egyptian to about nine.{{sfnp|Loprieno|1995a|p=46}} The basic word in Egyptian, similar to Semitic and Berber, is a [[Semitic root|triliteral]] or biliteral root of consonants and semiconsonants. Suffixes are added to form words. The verb conjugation corresponds to the [[Grammatical person|person]]. For example, the triconsonantal skeleton '''{{transl|egy|S-\u1e0e-M}}''' is the semantic core of the word 'hear'; its basic conjugation is ''{{transl|egy|s\u1e0fm}}'', 'he hears'. If the subject is a noun, suffixes are not added to the verb:{{sfnp|Loprieno|1995a|p=74}} ''{{transl|egy|s\u1e0fm \u1e25mt}}'', 'the woman hears'. \n \n Adjectives are derived from nouns through a process that Egyptologists call ''[[Arabic grammar|nisbation]]'' because of its similarity with Arabic.{{sfnp|Loprieno|2004|p=175}} The word order is {{smallcaps|predicate\u2013subject}} in verbal and adjectival sentences, and {{smallcaps|subject\u2013predicate}} in nominal and adverbial sentences.{{sfnp|Allen|2000|pp=67, 70, 109}} The subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun.{{sfnp|Loprieno|1995b|p=2147}} Verbs and nouns are negated by the [[Grammatical particle|particle]] ''n'', but ''nn'' is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences.

A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called [[hieratic]], which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]], became the prevalent writing style, and it is this form of writing\u2014along with formal hieroglyphs\u2014that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.{{sfnp|Loprieno|1995a|pp=10\u201326}} \n \n Around the first century AD, the Coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified [[Greek alphabet]] with the addition of some Demotic signs.{{sfnp|Allen|2000|p=7}} Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine{{sfnp|Loprieno|2004|p=166}} and Islamic periods in Egypt,{{sfnp|El-Daly|2005|p=164}} but only in the 1820s, after the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and years of research by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion]], were hieroglyphs [[decipherment of ancient Egyptian scripts|substantially deciphered]].{{sfnp|Allen|2000|p=8}} \n \n ===Literature=== \n {{Main|Ancient Egyptian literature}} \n Writing first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs. It was primarily an occupation of the scribes, who worked out of the ''Per Ankh'' institution or the House of Life. The latter comprised offices, libraries (called House of Books), laboratories and observatories.{{sfnp|Strouhal|1989|p=235}} Some of the best-known pieces of ancient Egyptian literature, such as the [[Pyramid Texts|Pyramid]] and [[Coffin Texts]], were written in Classical Egyptian, which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300{{nbsp}}BC. Late Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in [[Ramesside Period|Ramesside]] administrative documents, love poetry and tales, as well as in Demotic and Coptic texts. During this period, the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography, such as those of [[Harkhuf]] and [[Weni the Elder|Weni]]. The genre known as ''[[Sebayt]]'' ( \" instructions \" ) was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles; the [[Ipuwer Papyrus|Ipuwer papyrus]], a poem of lamentations describing [[natural disaster]]s and social upheaval, is a famous example. \n \n The [[Story of Sinuhe]], written in [[Middle Egyptian]], might be the classic of Egyptian literature.{{sfnp|Lichtheim|1975|p=11}} Also written at this time was the [[Westcar Papyrus]], a set of stories told to [[Khufu]] by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests.{{sfnp|Lichtheim|1975|p=215}} The [[Instruction of Amenemope]] is considered a masterpiece of Near Eastern literature.{{sfnp|Day|Gordon|Williamson|1995|p=23}} Towards the end of the New Kingdom, the [[Late Egyptian|vernacular language]] was more often employed to write popular pieces like the [[Story of Wenamun]] and the [[Instruction of Any]]. The former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt. From about 700{{nbsp}}BC, narrative stories and instructions, such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy, as well as personal and business documents were written in the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories written in demotic during the [[Greco-Roman]] period were set in previous historical eras, when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as [[Ramesses II]].{{sfnp|Lichtheim|1980|p=159}} \n \n ==Culture== \n \n ===Daily life=== \n {{further|Clothing in ancient Egypt|Dance in ancient Egypt|Music of Egypt#Old Kingdom}} \n [[File:Ostracon04-RamessidePeriod MetropolitanMuseum.png|thumb|[[Ostrakon]]: hunting a [[African lion#Cultural significance|lion]] with spear and dog]] \n [[File:LowClassAncientEgyptianStatuettes.png|thumb|left|Lower-class occupations]] \n Most ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land. Their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members, and were constructed of [[mudbrick]] designed to remain cool in the heat of the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread.{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|p=401}} [[Ancient Egyptian pottery|Ceramics]] served as household wares for the storage, preparation, transport, and consumption of food, drink, and raw materials.

Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; perfumes and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin.{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|p=405}} Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and [[Beauty and Cosmetics in Ancient Egypt|cosmetics]]. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's [[income]].{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|pp=406\u2013407}} \n \n Music and dance were popular entertainments for those who could afford them.

The staple diet consisted of bread and beer, supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis.

Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes, but also to reinforce the wide-ranging power of the pharaoh. The ancient Egyptians were skilled builders; using only simple but effective tools and sighting instruments, architects could build large [[stone structures]] with great accuracy and precision that is still envied today.{{sfnp|Clarke|Engelbach|1990|pp=94\u201397}} \n \n The domestic dwellings of elite and ordinary Egyptians alike were constructed from perishable materials such as mudbricks and wood, and have not survived.

The [[Narmer Palette]], for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs.{{sfnp|Robins|2008|p=21}} Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.{{sfnp|Robins|2008|p=12}} \n \n Ancient Egyptian artisans used stone as a medium for carving statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with [[gum arabic]] as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.{{sfnp|Nicholson|Shaw|2000|p=105}} \n \n Pharaohs used [[relief]]s to record victories in battle, royal decrees, and religious scenes.

The Egyptian pantheon was populated by [[Egyptian pantheon|gods]] who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this [[Ancient Egyptian deities|pantheon]] changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting [[Egyptian mythology|myths]] and stories into a coherent system.{{sfnp|James|2005|p=102}} These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.{{sfnp|Redford|2003|p=106}} \n \n [[File:Ka Statue of horawibra.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Ka statue]] provided a physical place for the Ka to manifest.]] \n Gods were worshiped in cult [[Egyptian temple|temples]] administered by priests acting on the king's behalf.

Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos.{{sfnp|James|2005|p=117}} After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of [[oracle]]s to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=313}} \n \n The Egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or ''aspects''. In addition to the body, each person had a ''\u0161wt'' (shadow), a ''ba'' (personality or soul), a ''ka'' (life-force), and a ''name''.{{sfnp|Allen|2000|pp=79, 94\u201395}} The heart, rather than the brain, was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions. After death, the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will, but they required the physical remains (or a substitute, such as a statue) as a permanent home. The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ''ka'' and ''ba'' and become one of the  \" blessed dead \" , living on as an ''akh'', or  \" effective one \" . For this to happen, the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial, in which the heart was weighed against a  \" [[Maat#The afterlife|feather of truth]]. \"  If deemed worthy, the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form.{{sfnp|Wasserman|1994|pp=150\u2013153}} If they were not deemed worthy, their heart was eaten by [[Ammit]] the Devourer and they were erased from the Universe. \n \n ===Burial customs=== \n < !-- this section is intended as a brief overview, more details under 'see also' -- > \n {{Main|Ancient Egyptian funerary practices}} \n [[File:Anubis attending the mummy of Sennedjem.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anubis]] was the ancient Egyptian god associated with mummification and burial rituals; here, he attends to a mummy.]] \n \n The ancient Egyptians maintained an elaborate set of burial customs that they believed were necessary to ensure immortality after death.

The arid, desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the [[Organ (anatomy)|internal organs]], wrapping the body in linen, and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin.

The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods. The military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes, such as those found at the city of [[Buhen]] on the way to Nubia. Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases, such as the fortress at Sile, which was a base of operations for expeditions to the [[Levant]]. In the New Kingdom, a series of pharaohs used the standing Egyptian army to attack and conquer [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] and parts of the Levant.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=245}} \n \n Typical military equipment included [[Bow (weapon)|bows and arrows]], spears, and round-topped shields made by stretching [[Leather|animal skin]] over a wooden frame. In the New Kingdom, the military began using [[Chariotry in ancient Egypt|chariots]] that had earlier been introduced by the Hyksos invaders. Weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze: shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle, spears were tipped with a bronze point, and the [[khopesh]] was adopted from Asiatic soldiers.{{sfnp|Manuelian|1998|pp=366\u2013367}} The pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army; it has been suggested that at least a few pharaohs, such as [[Seqenenre Tao II]] and his sons, did do so.{{sfnp|Clayton|1994|p=96}} However, it has also been argued that  \" kings of this period did not personally act as frontline war leaders, fighting alongside their troops. \" {{sfnp|Shaw|2009}} Soldiers were recruited from the general population, but during, and especially after, the New Kingdom, mercenaries from Nubia, Kush, and Libya were hired to fight for Egypt.{{sfnp|Shaw|2003|p=400}} \n \n ==Technology, medicine, and mathematics== \n < !-- This section is linked from [[Civilization]] -- > \n \n ===Technology=== \n {{Main|Ancient Egyptian technology}} \n [[File:Egyptian glass jar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Glassmaking was a highly developed art.]] \n \n In technology, medicine, and mathematics, ancient Egypt achieved a relatively high standard of productivity and sophistication. Traditional [[empiricism]], as evidenced by the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Edwin Smith]] and [[Ebers Papyrus|Ebers papyri]] (c. 1600{{nbsp}}BC), is first credited to Egypt. The Egyptians created their own alphabet and [[decimal|decimal system]]. \n \n ===Faience and glass=== \n [[File:Ancient Egyptian medical instruments.jpg|thumb|upright|Ancient Egyptian medical instruments depicted in a Ptolemaic period inscription on the temple at Kom Ombo]] \n \n Even before the Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had developed a glassy material known as [[Egyptian faience|faience]], which they treated as a type of artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], small amounts of [[Calcium oxide|lime]] and [[Sodium oxide|soda]], and a colorant, typically copper.{{sfnp|Nicholson|Shaw|2000|p=177}} The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as [[Egyptian blue]], also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or [[sintering]]) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.{{sfnp|Nicholson|Shaw|2000|p=109}} \n \n The ancient Egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill, but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently.{{sfnp|Nicholson|Shaw|2000|p=195}} It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding [[Micromineral|trace elements]] to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.{{sfnp|Nicholson|Shaw|2000|p=215}} \n \n ===Medicine=== \n {{Main|Ancient Egyptian medicine}} \n The medical problems of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from [[malaria]] and debilitating [[schistosomiasis]] parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to [[abscess]]es (though [[dental caries|caries]] were rare).{{sfnp|Filer|1995|p=94}} \n \n The diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars, which promoted [[Periodontitis|periodontal disease]].{{sfnp|Filer|1995|pp=78\u201380}} Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls, the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence.{{sfnp|Filer|1995|p=21}} Adult [[life expectancy]] was about 35 for men and 30 for women, but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one-third of the population died in infancy.{{efn|Figures are given for ''adult'' life expectancy and do not reflect life expectancy ''at birth.'' ({{harvp|Filer|1995|p=25}})}} \n \n [[File:Edwin Smith Papyrus v2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Edwin Smith surgical papyrus]] (c. 16th century BC), written in [[hieratic]], describes anatomy and medical treatments.]] \n Ancient Egyptian physicians were renowned in the ancient Near East for their healing skills, and some, such as [[Imhotep]], remained famous long after their deaths.{{sfnp|Filer|1995|p=39}} [[Herodotus]] remarked that there was a high degree of specialization among Egyptian physicians, with some treating only the head or the stomach, while others were eye-doctors and dentists.{{sfnp|Strouhal|1989|p=243}} Training of physicians took place at the ''Per Ankh'' or  \" House of Life \"  institution, most notably those headquartered in [[Bubastis|Per-Bastet]] during the New Kingdom and at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] and [[Sais, Egypt|Sa\u00efs]] in the Late period. [[Medical papyri]] show [[Empirical evidence|empirical knowledge]] of anatomy, injuries, and practical treatments.{{sfnp|Strouhal|1989|pp=244\u2013246}} \n \n Wounds were treated by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection,{{sfnp|Strouhal|1989|p=250}} while [[opium]], [[thyme]], and [[Atropa belladonna|belladona]] were used to relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers were made to the goddess [[Isis]]. Moldy bread, honey, and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns.{{sfnp|Pe\u0107anac|Janji\u0107|Komarcevi\u0107|Paji\u0107|2013|pages=263\u2013267}} Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve [[asthma]] symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set [[broken bones]], and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.{{sfnp|Filer|1995|p=38}} \n \n ===Maritime technology=== \n {{split section portions|Ancient_Egyptian_technology#Navigation_and_ship_building|date=February 2020}} \n Early [[Egyptians]] knew how to assemble planks of wood into a [[hull (ship)|ship hull]] and had mastered advanced forms of [[shipbuilding]] as early as 3000{{nbsp}}BC. The [[Archaeological Institute of America]] reports that the oldest [[Plank (wood)|planked]] [[ship]]s known are the [[Abydos boats]].{{sfnp|Ward|2001}} A group of 14 discovered ships in [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] were constructed of wooden planks  \" sewn \"  together. Discovered by Egyptologist David O'Connor of [[New York University]],{{sfnp|Schuster|2000}} woven [[strap]]s were found to have been used to lash the planks together,{{sfnp|Ward|2001}} and [[Cyperus papyrus|reeds]] or [[Poaceae|grass]] stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams.{{sfnp|Ward|2001}} Because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to [[Khasekhemwy|Pharaoh Khasekhemwy]], originally they were all thought to have belonged to him, but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000{{nbsp}}BC, and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating. The ship dating to 3000{{nbsp}}BC was {{convert|75|ft|m}} long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh, perhaps one as early as [[Hor-Aha]].{{sfnp|Schuster|2000}} \n \n Early Egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with [[treenail]]s to fasten them together, using [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] for [[caulking]] the seams. The  \" [[Khufu ship]] \" , a {{convert|43.6|m|ft|adj=on}} vessel sealed into a pit in the [[Giza pyramid complex]] at the foot of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] around 2500{{nbsp}}BC, is a full-size surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a [[solar barque]]. Early Egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with [[mortise and tenon]] joints.{{sfnp|Ward|2001}} \n \n [[File:Ancient Egyptian Seafaring Ship.jpg|thumb|left|Seagoing ship from Hateshepsut's Deir el-Bahari temple relief of a Punt Expedition]]Large seagoing ships are known to have been heavily used by the Egyptians in their trade with the city states of the eastern Mediterranean, especially [[Byblos]] (on the coast of modern-day Lebanon), and in several expeditions down the Red Sea to the [[Land of Punt]]. In fact one of the earliest Egyptian words for a seagoing ship is a  \" Byblos Ship \" , which originally defined a class of Egyptian seagoing ships used on the Byblos run; however, by the end of the Old Kingdom, the term had come to include large seagoing ships, whatever their destination.{{sfnp|Wachsmann|2009|p=19}} \n \n In 2011, archaeologists from Italy, the United States, and Egypt excavating a dried-up lagoon known as [[Mersa Gawasis]] have unearthed traces of an ancient harbor that once launched early voyages like [[Hatshepsut]]'s Punt expedition onto the open ocean. Some of the site's most evocative evidence for the ancient Egyptians' seafaring prowess include large ship timbers and hundreds of feet of ropes, made from papyrus, coiled in huge bundles.{{sfnp|Curry|2011}} In 2013 a team of Franco-Egyptian archaeologists discovered what is believed to be the world's oldest port, dating back about 4500 years, from the time of King [[Cheops]] on the Red Sea coast near Wadi el-Jarf (about 110 miles south of [[Suez]]).{{sfnmp|1a1=Boyle|1y=2013|2a1=Lorenzi|2y=2013}} \n \n In 1977, an ancient north\u2013south canal dating to the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] was discovered extending from [[Lake Timsah]] to the Ballah Lakes.{{sfnp|Shea|1977|pp=31\u201338}} It was dated to the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] by extrapolating dates of ancient sites constructed along its course.{{sfnp|Shea|1977|pp=31\u201338}}{{efn|See [[Suez Canal]].}} \n \n ===Mathematics=== \n {{Main|Ancient Egyptian mathematics}} \n \n [[File:Senenmut-Grab.JPG|right|thumb|[[Astronomical ceiling of Senemut Tomb|Astronomical chart in Senemut's tomb]], [[18th dynasty]] < ref > {{cite web |title=Astronomical Ceiling |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/544566 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200517170349/https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/544566 |archive-date=17 May 2020}} < /ref > ]] \n \n The earliest attested examples of mathematical calculations date to the predynastic [[Naqada]] period, and show a fully developed [[Egyptian numerals|numeral system]].{{efn|Understanding of Egyptian mathematics is incomplete due to paucity of available material and lack of exhaustive study of the texts that have been uncovered ({{harvp|Imhausen|2007|p=13}}).}} The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor, and grain.{{sfnp|Imhausen|2007|p=11}} Texts such as the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] and the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations\u2014addition, subtraction, [[Ancient Egyptian multiplication|multiplication]], and division\u2014use fractions, calculate the areas of rectangles, triangles, and circles and compute the volumes of boxes, columns and pyramids.

Each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively.{{sfnp|Clarke|Engelbach|1990|p=217}} Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write [[Egyptian fraction|fractions]] as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction ''two-fifths'' into the sum of ''one-third'' + ''one-fifteenth''. Standard tables of values facilitated this.{{sfnp|Clarke|Engelbach|1990|p=218}} Some [[Vulgar fraction|common fractions]], however, were written with a special glyph\u2014the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.{{sfnp|Gardiner|1957|p=197}} \n \n Ancient Egyptian mathematicians knew the [[Pythagorean theorem]] as an empirical formula.
