Azerbaijan's regime is a curious hybrid, in which semi-presidential institutions operate in the larger context of authoritarianism. The author compares formal Constitutional provisions with the practice of politics in the country, suggesting that formal and informal sources of authority come together to enhance the effective powers of the presidency. In addition to the considerable formal powers laid out in the Constitution, Azerbaijan's president also benefits from the support of the ruling party and informal family and patronage networks. LaPorte concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of this symbiosis between formal and informal institutions in Azerbaijan's semi-presidential regime.  }} < /ref > \n | leader_title1          = [[President of Azerbaijan|President]] \n | leader_name1           = [[Ilham Aliyev]] \n | leader_title2          = [[Vice President of Azerbaijan|Vice President]] \n | leader_name2           = [[Mehriban Aliyeva]] \n | leader_title3          = [[Prime Minister of Azerbaijan|Prime Minister]] \n | leader_name3           = [[Ali Asadov]] \n | legislature            = [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]] \n | sovereignty_type       = [[History of Azerbaijan|Formation]] \n | established_event1     = [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Democratic Republic]] \n | established_date1      = 28 May 1918 \n | established_event2     = [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialist Republic]] \n | established_date2      = 28 April 1920 \n | established_event3     = Independence from [[Soviet Union]] \n | established_date3      = {{plainlist| \n * 30 August 1991 (declared) \n * 18 October 1991 (independence) \n * 25 December 1991 (completed)}} \n | established_event4     = [[Alma-Ata Protocol|Full membership into the CIS]] \n | established_date4      = 21 December 1991 \n | established_event5     = [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 742|Admitted to the]] [[United Nations]] \n | established_date5      = 2 March 1992 \n | established_event6     = {{nowrap|[[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] adopted}} \n | established_date6      = 12 November 1995 \n | area_km2               = 86600 \n | area_rank = 112th \n | area_sq_mi             = 33436  < !-- Do not remove [[WP:MOSNUM]] -- > \n | percent_water          = 1.6 \n | population_estimate    = 10,127,874 < ref > {{cite web|access-date=2020-02-09|title=Az\u0259rbaycanda \u0259hali say\u0131 da art\u0131b, bo\u015fanmalar da\u2026 \u2013 R\u0259smi STAT\u0130ST\u0130KA|url=https://modern.az/az/news/211638|website=modern.az}} < /ref > \n | population_estimate_year = 2019 \n | population_estimate_rank = 91st \n | population_density_km2 = 115 \n | population_density_sq_mi = 293  < !-- Do not remove [[WP:MOSNUM]] -- > \n | population_density_rank = 99th \n | GDP_PPP                = $189.050 & nbsp;billion < ref name= \" World Economic Outlook \" > {{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=53 & pr.y=6 & sy=2019 & ey=2024 & scsm=1 & ssd=1 & sort=country & ds=. & br=1 & c=912 & s=NGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPPC & grp=0 & a=|website=imf.org|publisher=International Monetary Fund|date= April 2019|access-date=16 August 2019}} < /ref > \n | GDP_PPP_year = 2019 \n | GDP_PPP_rank = \n | GDP_PPP_per_capita     = $18,793 < ref name= \" World Economic Outlook \" / > \n | GDP_PPP_per_capita_rank = \n | GDP_nominal            = $45.284 billion < ref name= \" World Economic Outlook \" / > \n | GDP_nominal_year = 2019 \n | GDP_nominal_rank = \n | GDP_nominal_per_capita = $4,498 < ref name= \" World Economic Outlook \" / > \n | GDP_nominal_per_capita_rank = \n | Gini                   = 26.6  < !-- number only -- > \n | Gini_year = 2005 \n | Gini_change            =  < !-- increase/decrease/steady -- > \n | Gini_ref               =  < ref name= \" wb-gini \" > {{cite web |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?locations=AZ |title=GINI index (World Bank estimate)|publisher=World Bank |access-date=5 March 2019}} < /ref > \n | Gini_rank = \n | HDI                    = 0.756  < !-- number only -- > \n | HDI_year = 2019 < !-- Please use the year to which the data refers, not the publication year -- > \n | HDI_change             = increase < !-- increase/decrease/steady -- > \n | HDI_ref                =  < ref name= \" UNHDR \" > {{cite book|title=Human Development Report 2020 The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene|date=15 December 2020|publisher=United Nations Development Programme|isbn=978-92-1-126442-5|pages=343\u2013346|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2020.pdf|access-date=16 December 2020}} < /ref > \n | HDI_rank = 88th \n | currency               = [[Azerbaijani manat|Manat]] (\u20bc) \n | currency_code          = AZN \n | time_zone              = [[Azerbaijan Time|AZT]] \n | utc_offset             = +4 \n | drives_on              = right \n | calling_code           = [[Telephone numbers in Azerbaijan|+994]] \n | cctld                  = [[.az]] \n | today                  = \n | leader_title4          = [[Speaker of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly Speaker]] \n | leader_name4           = [[Sahiba Gafarova]] \n }} \n \n '''Azerbaijan''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|audio=En-Azerbaijan-pronunciation.ogg|\u02cc|\u00e6|z|\u0259r|b|a\u026a|\u02c8|d\u0292|\u0251\u02d0|n|,_|-|\u02c8|\u0292|\u0251\u02d0|n}}, {{IPAc-en|US|\u02cc|\u0251\u02d0|z|\u0259r|b|a\u026a|\u02c8|d\u0292|\u0251\u02d0|n|,_|\u02cc|\u00e6|z|-|}};

The Parliament of Azerbaijan, called Milli Majlis, consists of 125 deputies elected based on [[first past the post|majority vote]], with a term of 5 years for each elected member. The elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November.

The top or highest tier of the government is the Executive Power headed by President. The President appoints the Cabinet of Ministers and other high-ranking officials. The Local Executive Authority is merely a continuation of Executive Power. The legal status of local state administration in Azerbaijan is determined by the Provision on Local Executive Authority (''Yerli Icra Hakimiyati''), adopted 16 June 1999. In June 2012, the President approved the new Regulation, which granted additional powers to Local Executive Authorities, strengthening their dominant position in Azerbaijan's local affairs < ref > {{cite web |title=Az\u0259rbaycan Prezidentinin R\u0259smi internet s\u0259hif\u0259si |url=https://president.az/ |website=president.az |language=az}} < /ref >  Chapter 9 of the Constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic addresses major issues of local self-government, such as the legal status of municipalities, types of local self-government bodies, their basic powers and relationships to other official entities. The other nominal tier of governance is municipalities (''B\u0259l\u0259diy\u0259'') and members of municipalities are elected by a general vote in Municipal elections every five years. Currently, there are 1,607 municipalities across the country. The Law on Municipal Elections and the Law on the Status of Municipalities were the first to be adopted in the field of local government (2 July 1999). The Law on Municipal Service regulates the activities of municipal employees, their rights, duties, labor conditions and social benefits, and outlines the structure of the executive apparatus and the organization of municipal service. The Law on the Status of Municipalities regulates the role and structure of municipal bodies and outlines state guarantees of legal and financial autonomy. The law pays special attention to the adoption and execution of municipal programs concerning social protection, social and economic development, and the local environment.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} \n \n The Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution.

The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves  \" Turcoman \"  rather than  \" Oghuz, \"  had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen.
