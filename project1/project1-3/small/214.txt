Railways connect it with the mineral regions of north-central Alabama. \n \n After the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers, the principal tributary of the Alabama is the [[Cahaba River]], which is about {{convert|194|mi}} long < ref name=NHD/ >  and joins the Alabama River about {{convert|10|mi}} below Selma. The Alabama River's main tributary, the Coosa River, crosses the mineral region of Alabama and is navigable for light-draft boats from [[Rome, Georgia]], to about {{convert|117|mi}} above [[Wetumpka, Alabama|Wetumpka]] (about {{convert|102|mi}} below Rome and {{convert|26|mi}} below Greensport), and from Wetumpka to its junction with the Tallapoosa. The channel of the river has been considerably improved by the federal government. \n \n The navigation of the Tallapoosa River \u2013 which has its source in [[Paulding County, Georgia]], and is about {{convert|265|mi}} long < ref name=NHD/ >  \u2013 is prevented by [[shoal]]s and a {{convert|60|ft|adj=on}} fall at [[Tallassee, Alabama|Tallassee]], a few miles north of its junction with the Coosa. The Alabama is navigable throughout the year. \n \n The river played an important role in the growth of the economy in the region during the 19th century as a source of transportation of goods, which included slaves. The river is still used for transportation of farming produce; however, it is not as important as it once was due to the construction of roads and railways. \n \n Documented by Europeans first in 1701, < ref > {{Cite book|last=Willson|first=Marcius|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eEvIL9V3RAgC & q=Alabama+River+europeans+found+in+1712 & pg=RA2-PA522|title=American History: Comprising Historical Sketches of the Indian Tribes: A Description of American Antiquities, with an Inquiry Into Their Origin and the Origin of the Indian Tribes; History of the United States, with Appendices Showing Its Connection with European History; History of the Present British Provinces; History of Mexico; and History of Texas, Brought Down to the Time of Its Admission Into the American Union|date=1847|publisher=W.H.

The bridge was the site of the famous [[Selma to Montgomery marches|marches for voting rights]] in 1965; the first became known as  \" Bloody Sunday \"  because the state and county police beat protesters after they crossed out of the city. \n \n ==Lock and dams== \n The Alabama River has three lock and dams between Montgomery and the Mobile River.  The Robert F. Henry Lock  &  Dam is located at river mile 236.2, the Millers Ferry Lock  &  Dam is located at river mile 133.0, and the Claiborne Lock  &  Dam is located at river mile 72.5. < ref > Courtesy [http://www.sam.usace.army.mil/ U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Mobile District] \n < /ref > \n \n ==Gallery== \n < gallery > \n Image:USACE Claiborne Lock and Dam.jpg|Claiborne Lock and Dam on the Alabama River, approximately {{convert|5|mi|0}} upriver from Claiborne, Monroe County \n Image:USACE Robert F Henry Lock and Dam.jpg|Robert F.
