It is the [[List of African countries by area|largest country by total area]] in [[Africa]], and by extension, the [[Arab world]], and is bordered to [[Algeria\u2013Tunisia border|the northeast]] by [[Tunisia]]; to [[Algeria\u2013Libya border|the east]] by [[Libya]]; to [[Algeria\u2013Niger border|the southeast]] by [[Niger]]; to [[Algeria\u2013Western Sahara border|the southwest]] by [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Western Sahara]]; to [[Algeria\u2013Morocco border|the west]] by [[Morocco]]; and to the north by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The country has a semi-arid geography, with most of the population living in the [[Fertility|fertile]] north and the [[Sahara]] dominating the geography of the south. Algeria covers an area of {{convert|2381741|km2|sqmi|0}}, with a population of 44 million, and is the [[List of African countries by population|ninth-most populous country]] in Africa. The capital and [[List of cities in Algeria|largest city]] is [[Algiers]], located in the far north, on the Mediterranean coast.  \n \n Pre-1962 Algeria has seen many empires and dynasties, including ancient [[Numidia]]ns, [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Punics|Carthaginians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], [[Rustamid dynasty|Rustamid]], [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisid]], [[Aghlabids]], [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]], [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]], [[Hammadid dynasty|Hammadids]], [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]], [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], [[Zayyanid dynasty|Zayyanids]], [[Spanish Empire|Spaniards]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and finally, the [[French colonial empire|French Colonial Empire]]. The vast majority of Algeria's population is [[Arab-Berber]], practicing [[Islam in Algeria|Islam]], and using the official languages of [[Modern Standard Arabic|Arabic]] and [[Berber languages|Berber]]. However, [[French language in Algeria|French]] serves as an administrative and education language in some contexts, and [[Algerian Arabic]] is the main spoken language. \n \n Algeria is a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential republic]], with local constituencies consisting of 58 provinces and 1,541 communes. Algeria is a [[regional power]] in North Africa, and a [[middle power]] in global affairs. It has the highest [[Human Development Index]] of all non-island African countries and one of the [[List of African countries by GDP (nominal)|largest economies on the continent]], based largely on energy exports. Algeria has the world's [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|sixteenth-largest oil reserves]] and the [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|ninth-largest reserves]] of [[natural gas]]. [[Sonatrach]], the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa, supplying large amounts of [[natural gas]] to Europe. [[Algerian People's National Armed Forces|Algeria's military]] is one of the largest in Africa, and has the largest defence budget on the continent. It is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[Arab League]], [[OPEC]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[Arab Maghreb Union]], of which it is a founding member. \n \n == Name == \n Other forms of the name are: {{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0631|al-Jaz\u0101\u02beir}}, {{lang-arq|\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0632\u0627\u064a\u0631|al-dz\u0101y\u012br}}; {{lang-ber|Lezzayer}}; {{lang-ber|\u2d4d\u2d3b\u2d63\u2d30\u2d62\u2d3b\u2d54}}; {{lang-ber|\u0644\u0632\u0651\u0627\u064a\u0631}}; {{lang-fr|Alg\u00e9rie}}.

As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern-day [[Morocco]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilisation, unequalled until the coming of the [[Almohads]] and [[Almoravids]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC. \n [[File:Egypt, Rome, Carthage and Numidia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Numidia]] along with [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egypt]], [[Roman Republic|Rome]], and [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] 200 BC]] \n After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]]. \n \n For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region. Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was the bishop of [[Hippo Regius]] (modern-day Annaba, Algeria), located in the Roman province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].

It was during this time that the [[Fatimids]] or children of Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, came to the Maghreb. These  \" Fatimids \"  went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, Hejaz and the Levant, boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, made up primarily of [[Arabs]] and [[Levant]]ines extending from Algeria to their capital state of [[Cairo]]. The [[Fatimid caliphate]] began to collapse when its governors the [[Zirids]] seceded. In order to punish them the Fatimids sent the Arab [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] against them. The resultant war is recounted in the epic [[Taghribat Bani Hilal|T\u0101ghrib\u0101t]].

The [[Zirid]]s, however, were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of Arab customs and culture. The indigenous [[Berber people|Amazigh]] tribes, however, remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids).

Probably in 1048, the Zirid ruler or viceroy, el-Mu'izz, decided to end this suzerainty. The [[Fatimid]] state was too weak to attempt a punitive expedition; The Viceroy, el-Mu'izz, also found another means of revenge. \n \n Between the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]] were living [[Bedouin]] tribes expelled from [[Arabia]] for their disruption and turbulent influence, both [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] among others, whose presence disrupted farmers in the [[Nile Valley]] since the nomads would often loot. The then [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] vizier devised to relinquish control of the [[Maghreb]] and obtained the agreement of his sovereign. This not only prompted the Bedouins to leave, but the [[Fatimid]] treasury even gave them a light expatriation cash allowance. \n \n Whole tribes set off with women, children, ancestors, animals and camping equipment. Some stopped on the way, especially in [[Cyrenaica]], where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in [[Ifriqiya]] by the [[Gab\u00e8s Governorate|Gabe]]s region. The [[Zirid]] ruler tried to stop this rising tide, but with each encounter, the last under the walls of [[Kairouan]], his troops were defeated and the Arabs remained masters of the field. \n \n The flood was still rising, and in 1057, the Arabs spread on the high plains of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] where they gradually choked [[Beni Hammad Fort|Qalaa of Banu Hammad]], as they had done in Kairouan a few decades ago. From there they gradually gained the upper [[Algiers]] and [[Oran]] plains. Some were forcibly taken by the [[Almohads]] in the second half of the 12th century.

In 1516 the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[Hafsids]], moved their base of operations to Algiers. They succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the [[Spain|Spaniards]] but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region, forcing the previous ruler, Abu Hamo Musa III of the ''Bani Ziyad'' dynasty, to flee. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Tlemcen]], Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. With the aid of this force, [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Hayreddin]] conquered the whole area between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1792). < ref name= \" csa16 \"  / > < ref name=Mikaberidze/ > \n \n [[File:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hayreddin Barbarossa]]]] \n \n The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544. Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by janissaries, known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659. < ref name= \" csa16 \"  / > \n \n [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa.

It was at first dominated by the ''[[ojaq]]''; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey's instrument.

The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671\u20131830) that the system survived, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of Ottoman government was remarkably orderly.
