However, it did not come into general use until [[Joseph Greenberg]] (1950) formally proposed its adoption. In doing so, Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that 'Hamitic' was not a valid group and that language [[cladistics]] did not reflect race.{{sfn|Dimmendaal|2008}}{{page number missing|date=April 2021}} \n \n Individual scholars have also called the family  \" Erythraean \"  (Tucker 1966) and  \" Lisramic \"  (Hodge 1972).

This situation is not unusual, even among long-established language families: scholars also frequently disagree on the internal classification of the [[Indo-European languages]], for instance. \n * The extinct [[Meroitic language]] has been proposed ([[Bruce Trigger]], 1964, < ref name=Trigger01 > Trigger, Bruce G., ''\u2018Meroitic and Eastern Sudanic: A Linguistic Relationship?\u2019'', Kush 12, 1964, 188\u2013194. < /ref >  1977 < ref name=Trigger02 > Trigger, Bruce, G.,''\u2018The Classification of Meroitic: Geographical Considerations\u2019'', Schriften zur Geschichte und Kultur des Alten Orients 13, 1977, 421\u2013435. < /ref > ) as an unclassified Afroasiatic language, because it shares the [[phonotactics]] characteristic of the family, but there is not enough evidence to secure a classification (Fritz Hintze, 1974, < ref name=Hintze01 > Hintze, Fritz, ''\u2018Some Problems of Meroitic Philology\u2019'', Abdel Gadir Mahmoud Abdalla (ed.),  Studies of the Ancient Languages of the Sudan, Sudanese Studies 3, Khartoum University Press, Khartoum, 1974, 73\u201378. < /ref > {{sfn|Hintze|1979|pp=1\u2013214}}{{page number missing|date=April 2021}} \n * The classification of [[Kujarg\u00e9 language|Kujarg\u00e9]] within Afroasiatic is not agreed upon.

In 1844, [[Theodor Benfey]] suggested a language family consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter  \" Ethiopic \" ). < ref > {{Cite book|last=Pereltsvaig|first=Asya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8q06xer0vHkC & q=Theodor+Benfey+suggested+a+language+family+consisting+of+Semitic%2C+Berber%2C+and+Cushitic & pg=PA207|title=Languages of the World: An Introduction|date=9 February 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-00278-4|language=en}} < /ref >  In the same year, T.N. Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} \n \n [[Friedrich M\u00fcller (linguist)|Friedrich M\u00fcller]] named the traditional Hamito-Semitic family in 1876 in his ''Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft'' ( \" Outline of Linguistics \" ), and defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a  \" Hamitic \"  group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; he excluded the Chadic group.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} It was the [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] (1810\u20131884) who restricted Hamitic to the non-Semitic languages in Africa, which are characterized by a grammatical [[Grammatical gender|gender system]]. This  \" Hamitic language group \"  was proposed to unite various, mainly North-African, languages, including the Ancient [[Egyptian language]], the [[Berber languages]], the [[Cushitic languages]], the [[Beja language]], and the [[Chadic languages]]. Unlike M\u00fcller, Lepsius considered that [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Nama language|Nama]] were part of the Hamitic group. These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. Both authors used the skin-color, mode of subsistence, and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together.{{sfn|Ruhlen|1991|pp=80,81}} \n [[File:Africa ethnic groups 1996.png|thumb|Distribution of the Afroasiatic/Hamito-Semitic languages in Africa]] \n In 1912, [[Carl Meinhof]] published ''Die Sprachen der Hamiten'' ( \" The Languages of the Hamites \" ), in which he expanded Lepsius's model, adding the [[Fula language|Fula]], [[Maasai language|Maasai]], [[Bari language|Bari]], [[Nandi languages|Nandi]], [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] languages to the Hamitic group. Meinhof's model was widely supported in the 1940s.{{sfn|Ruhlen|1991|pp=80,81}} Meinhof's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that  \" speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa'. \" {{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=797}} However, in the case of the so-called [[Nilo-Hamitic languages]] (a concept he introduced), it was based on the typological feature of gender and a  \" fallacious theory of [[mixed language|language mixture]]. \"  Meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub  \" Nilo-Hamitic \"  were in fact Nilotic languages, with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages.{{sfn|Ruhlen|1991|p=109}} \n \n [[Leo Reinisch]] (1909) had already proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic. However, his suggestion found little acceptance. [[Marcel Cohen]] (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct  \" Hamitic \"  subgroup and included [[Hausa language|Hausa]] (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary. Finally, [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of  \" Hamitic \"  as a language category by linguists. Greenberg refuted Meinhof's linguistic theories and rejected the use of racial and social evidence. In dismissing the notion of a separate  \" Nilo-Hamitic \"  language category, in particular, Greenberg was  \" returning to a view widely held a half-century earlier. \"  He consequently rejoined Meinhof's so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings.{{sfn|Ruhlen|1991|pp=76, 87}} He also added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afroasiatic for the family. Almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus. \n \n Greenberg's model was fully developed in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963), in which he reassigned most of Meinhof's additions to Hamitic to other language families, notably [[Nilo-Saharan]]. Following [[Isaac Schapera]] and rejecting Meinhof, he classified the [[Hottentot language|Khoekhoe language]] as a member of the [[Khoisan languages]], a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of [[Click consonant|click sounds]].{{sfn|Sands|2009|pp=559\u2013580}} To Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], though this view has been discredited as linguists working on these languages consider them to be [[Language isolate|linguistic isolates]].{{sfn|Sands|1998|p=14}}{{sfn|Ruhlen|1991|p=117}} Despite this, Greenberg's classification remains a starting point for modern work of many languages spoken in Africa, and the Hamitic category (and its extension to Nilo-Hamitic) has no part in this.{{sfn|Ruhlen|1991|p=117}} \n \n Since the three traditional branches of the Hamitic languages (Berber, Cushitic and Egyptian) have not been shown to form an exclusive ([[Monophyly|monophyletic]]) phylogenetic unit of their own, separate from other Afroasiatic languages, linguists no longer use the term in this sense. Each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger Afroasiatic family. < ref name= \" Welmers \" > {{cite book|last1=Everett Welmers|first1=William|title=African Language Structures|date=1974|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520022102|page=[https://archive.org/details/africanlanguages0000welm/page/16 16]|url=https://archive.org/details/africanlanguages0000welm/page/16}} < /ref > \n \n In 1969, [[Harold C.

(In Norwegian)|website=uio.no|access-date=14 April 2018}} < /ref > \n * Harold Fleming (1981) divides non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or  \" Erythraean \" , into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and Chadic-Berber-Egyptian. He later added Semitic and Beja to Chadic-Berber-Egyptian and tentatively proposed [[Ongota language|Ongota]] as a new third branch of Erythraean. He thus divided Afroasiatic into two major branches, Omotic and Erythraean, with Erythraean consisting of three sub-branches, Cushitic, Chadic-Berber-Egyptian-Semitic-Beja, and Ongota. \n * Like Harold Fleming, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1995: 490) divides Afroasiatic into two branches, Omotic and Erythrean. He divides Omotic into two branches, North Omotic and South Omotic. He divides Erythrean into Cushitic, comprising Beja, Agaw, and East-South Cushitic, and North Erythrean, comprising Chadic and  \" Boreafrasian. \"  According to his classification, Boreafrasian consists of Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic. \n * [[Vladimir Orel]] and Olga Stolbova (1995) group Berber with Semitic and Chadic with Egyptian. They split up Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afroasiatic, viewing Cushitic as a [[Sprachbund]] rather than a [[language family]]. \n * [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1996) subdivides Afroasiatic in two, grouping Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as East-West Afrasian (ESA), and Chadic with Egyptian as North-South Afrasian (NSA). He excludes Omotic from Afroasiatic. \n * [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]] (1997) groups Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as  \" Macro-Cushitic \" . He regards Chadic and Omotic as the branches of Afroasiatic most remote from the others. \n * Alexander Militarev (2000), on the basis of [[lexicostatistics]], groups Berber with Chadic and both more distantly with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic. He places Ongota in South Omotic. \n \n ==Position among the world's languages== \n Afroasiatic is one of the four major [[Languages of Africa|language families]] spoken in Africa identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963). It is one of the few whose speech area is transcontinental, with languages from Afroasiatic's Semitic branch also spoken in the Middle East and Europe. \n \n There are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family. However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made. The best-known of these are the following: \n * [[Hermann M\u00f6ller]] (1906) argued for a relation between [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and the [[Indo-European languages]]. This proposal was accepted by a few linguists (e.g. [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] and [[Louis Hjelmslev]]). (For a fuller account, see [[Indo-Semitic languages]].) However, the theory has little currency today, although most linguists do not deny the existence of grammatical similarities between both families (such as [[grammatical gender]], noun-adjective [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], three-way [[Grammatical number|number]] distinction, and [[vowel alternation]] as a means of derivation). \n * [[File:Nostratic macro-family migration.png|thumb|Proposed diffusion of  \" Nostratic-speaking peoples \"  from the Middle East. Major branches are Afroasiatic (or Afrasians), Indo-European, Kartvelian (Caucasian), Dravidian, Uralic, and possibly Turkic (Altaic). Nostraticists frequently cite genetic evidence to support their linguistic phylum.]]Apparently influenced by M\u00f6ller (a colleague of his at the [[University of Copenhagen]]), [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] included Hamito-Semitic (the term replaced by Afroasiatic) in his proposed [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic macro-family]] (cf. Pedersen 1931:336\u2013338), also included the Indo-European, [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], [[Yukaghir languages]], and [[Dravidian languages]]. This inclusion was retained by subsequent Nostraticists, starting with [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky]]. \n * [[Joseph Greenberg]] (2000\u20132002) did not reject a relationship of Afroasiatic to these other languages, but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other, grouping instead these other languages in a separate macro-family, which he called [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], and to which he added [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotian]], [[Nivkh language|Gilyak]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japonic languages|Japanese-Ryukyuan]], [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages|Eskimo\u2013Aleut]], and [[Ainu languages|Ainu]]. \n * Most recently, [[Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin|Sergei Starostin]]'s school has accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup of Nostratic, with Afroasiatic, Dravidian, and Kartvelian in Nostratic outside of Eurasiatic. The even larger [[Borean languages|Borean super-family]] contains Nostratic as well as [[Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian languages|Den\u00e9-Caucasian]] and [[Austric languages|Austric]]. \n \n ==Date of Afroasiatic== \n [[File:Assyriansample.ogg|thumb|right|180px|Speech sample in the Semitic [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Neo-Aramaic]] language, a descendant of [[Old Aramaic]]]] \n The earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] inscription dated to c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago). < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=Larkin |title=Earliest Egyptian Glyphs |journal=Archaeology Magazine |date=March\u2013April 1999 |volume=52 |issue=2 |url=https://archive.archaeology.org/9903/newsbriefs/egypt.html |access-date=April 14, 2018}} < /ref >  Symbols on [[Gerzeh culture|Gerzean]] (Naqada II) pottery resembling [[Egyptian hieroglyphs#History and evolution|Egyptian hieroglyphs]] date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting an earlier possible dating. This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic. However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from [[Proto-Afroasiatic language|Proto-Afroasiatic]],{{sfn|Trombetti|1905|pp= 1\u20132}} and considerable time must have elapsed in between them. Estimates of the date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely. They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago), and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago). According to [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken [[circa|c.]] 10,000 BC. Christopher Ehret (2002: 35\u201336) asserts that Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC. These dates are older than those associated with other [[proto-language]]s. \n \n ==Afroasiatic Urheimat== \n {{main|Afroasiatic Urheimat}} \n The Afroasiatic ''[[urheimat]]'', the hypothetical place where [[Proto-Afroasiatic language]] speakers lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages, is unknown. Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in [[Western Asia|West Asia]], [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and parts of the [[Sahel]]. Their distribution seems to have been influenced by the [[Sahara pump theory|Sahara pump]] operating over the last 10,000 years. \n \n While there is no definitive agreement on when or where the original homeland of this language family existed, most scholarly work in linguistics favor an [[Middle Eastern]] origin and an early back migrations into Africa.{{sfn|Hall|Jarvie|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lyhvaJq2biEC & pg=PA27 27]}} < ref > {{Cite book|last=Blench|first=R.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esFy3Po57A8C|title=Archaeology, Language, and the African Past|date=2006|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0-7591-0466-2|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Jared|last2=Bellwood|first2=Peter|date=2003-04-25|title=Farmers and Their Languages: The First Expansions|url=https://science.sciencemag.org/content/300/5619/597|journal=Science|language=en|volume=300|issue=5619|pages=597\u2013603|doi=10.1126/science.1078208|issn=0036-8075|pmid=12714734}} < /ref > < ref > Shirai N (2010).
