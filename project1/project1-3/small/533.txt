Such use of Anatolian designations was employed during the reign of Roman emperor [[Diocletian]] (284-305), who created the [[Diocese of the East]], known in Greek as the Eastern (\u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2 / ''Anatolian'') Diocese, but completely unrelated to the regions of Asia Minor. In their widest territorial scope, Anatolian designations were employed during the reign of Roman emperor [[Constantine I]] (306-337), who created the [[Praetorian prefecture of the East]], known in Greek as the Eastern (\u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2 / ''Anatolian'') Prefecture, encompassing all eastern regions of the [[Late Roman Empire]], and spaning from [[Diocese of Thrace|Thrace]] to [[Diocese of Egypt|Egypt]]. \n \n Only after the loss of other eastern regions during the 7th century, and the reduction of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] eastern domains to Asia Minor, that region became the only remaining part of the ''Byzantine East'', and thus commonly referred to (in Greek) as the Eastern (\u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2 / ''Anatolian'') part of the Empire. In the same time, the [[Anatolic Theme]] (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u03b8\u03ad\u03bc\u03b1 /  \" the Eastern theme \" ) was created, as a province (''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]]'') covering the western and central parts of Turkey's present-day [[Central Anatolia Region]], centered around [[Iconium]], but ruled from the city of [[Amorium]]. < ref name= \" First Thema 1952, p. 59 \" > \" On the First Thema, called Anatolik\u00f3n.

The region became famous for exporting raw materials. Organized trade between Anatolia and [[Mesopotamia]] started to emerge during the period of the [[Akkadian Empire]], and was continued and intensified during the period of the [[Old Assyrian Empire]], between the 21st and the 18th centuries BCE. Assyrian traders were bringing tin and textiles in exchange for copper, silver or gold.

They were speakers of an Indo-European language, the [[Hittite language]], or ''nesili'' (the language of Nesa) in Hittite. The Hittites originated from local ancient cultures that grew in Anatolia, in addition to the arrival of Indo-European languages. Attested for the first time in the Assyrian tablets of [[K\u00fcltepe|Nesa]] around 2000 BCE, they conquered Hattusa in the 18th century BCE, imposing themselves over Hattian- and Hurrian-speaking populations. According to the widely accepted [[Kurgan theory]] on the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland]], however, the Hittites (along with the other Indo-European [[ancient Anatolians]]) were themselves relatively recent [[Indo-European migrations|immigrants]] to Anatolia from the north. However, they did not necessarily displace the population genetically; they assimilated into the former peoples' culture, preserving the Hittite language. \n \n The Hittites adopted the Mesopotamian [[cuneiform script]]. In the Late Bronze Age, [[Hittites#New Kingdom|Hittite New Kingdom]] (c. 1650 BCE) was founded, becoming an empire in the 14th century BCE after the conquest of [[Kizzuwatna]] in the south-east and the defeat of the [[Assuwa league]] in western Anatolia. The empire reached its height in the 13th century BCE, controlling much of Asia Minor, northwestern [[Syria]], and northwest upper Mesopotamia. However, the Hittite advance toward the Black Sea coast was halted by the semi-nomadic pastoralist and tribal [[Kaskians]], a non-Indo-European people who had earlier displaced the [[Palaic language|Palaic-speaking]] Indo-Europeans. < ref > Carruba, O.

These became known as [[Syro-Hittite states]]. \n \n :'''Neo-Assyrian Empire''' \n \n From the 10th to late 7th centuries BCE, much of Anatolia (particularly the southeastern regions) fell to the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], including all of the [[Syro-Hittite states]], [[Tabal]], [[Kingdom of Commagene]], the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] and swathes of [[Cappadocia]]. \n \n The Neo-Assyrian empire collapsed due to a bitter series of civil wars followed by a combined attack by [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], Scythians and their own [[Babylonia]]n relations. The last Assyrian city to fall was [[Harran]] in southeast Anatolia. This city was the birthplace of the last king of [[Babylon]], the Assyrian [[Nabonidus]] and his son and regent [[Belshazzar]]. Much of the region then fell to the short-lived Iran-based [[Medes|Median Empire]], with the Babylonians and Scythians briefly appropriating some territory. \n \n :'''Cimmerian and Scythian invasions''' \n From the late 8th century BCE, a new wave of Indo-European-speaking raiders entered northern and northeast Anatolia: the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]].

As the Ottoman Empire further shrank in the [[Balkan]] regions and then fragmented during the [[Balkan Wars]], much of the non-Christian populations of its former possessions, mainly Balkan Muslims (Bosnian Muslims, [[Albanians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Pomaks|Muslim Bulgarians]] and [[Greek Muslims]] such as the [[Vallahades]] from [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]), were resettled in various parts of Anatolia, mostly in formerly Christian villages throughout Anatolia. \n \n A continuous reverse migration occurred since the early 19th century, when Greeks from Anatolia, [[Constantinople]] and Pontus area migrated toward the newly independent [[Kingdom of Greece]], and also towards the [[United States]], the southern part of the [[Russian Empire]], Latin America, and the rest of Europe. \n \n Following the Russo-Persian Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828) and the incorporation of Eastern Armenia into the Russian Empire, another migration involved the large Armenian population of Anatolia, which recorded significant migration rates from Western Armenia (Eastern Anatolia) toward the Russian Empire, especially toward its newly established Armenian provinces. \n \n Anatolia remained [[multi-ethnic]] until the early 20th century (see the [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]]). During World War I, the [[Armenian genocide]], the [[Greek genocide]] (especially in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]), and the [[Assyrian genocide]] almost entirely removed the ancient indigenous communities of [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Greeks|Greek]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] populations in Anatolia and surrounding regions. Following the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922]], most remaining ethnic Anatolian Greeks were forced out during the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. Of the remainder, most have left Turkey since then, leaving fewer than 5,000 Greeks in Anatolia today. \n \n ==Geology== \n [[Image:View of Cappadocia edit.jpg|thumb|left|View of the [[Cappadocia]] landscape]] \n [[File:Pamukkale_30.jpg|thumb|Travertine terrace formations in [[Pamukkale]]]] \n \n {{Main|Geology of Turkey}} \n Anatolia's terrain is structurally complex.
