The [[type species]], ''A. sarcophagus'', was apparently restricted in [[range (biology)|range]] to the modern-day [[Canadian province]] of [[Alberta]], after which the genus is named, although an indeterminate species ( \" cf. ''Albertosaurus'' sp. \" ) has been discovered in the [[Corral de Enmedio Formation|Corral de Enmedio]] and [[Packard Formation]]s in [[Mexico]]. < ref name= \" sullivanlucas-alberto \"  / >  Scientists disagree on the content of the genus, with some recognizing ''[[Gorgosaurus libratus]]'' as a second species. \n \n As a tyrannosaurid, ''Albertosaurus'' was a [[biped]]al [[predator]] with tiny, two-fingered hands and a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may have been at the top of the [[food chain]] in its local [[ecosystem]]. While ''Albertosaurus'' was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'', growing {{convert|8|to|10|m|abbr=on}} and possibly weighing {{convert|2.5|t|ST}} or less. \n \n Since the first discovery in 1884, [[fossil]]s of more than 30 individuals have been recovered, providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of ''Albertosaurus'' anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids. The discovery of 26 individuals at one site provides evidence of [[pack hunter|pack]] behaviour and allows studies of [[ontogeny]] and [[population biology]], which are impossible with lesser-known dinosaurs due to their remains being rarer and more fragmentary compared to those of ''Albertosaurus''. \n \n ==History of discovery== \n \n ===Naming=== \n [[File:Tyrrell - Crane Albertosaure.jpg|thumb|left|[[Holotype specimen]] CMN 5600]] \n ''Albertosaurus'' was named by [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] in a one-page note at the end of his 1905 description of ''Tyrannosaurus rex''. < ref name=osborn1905 > {{cite journal |last=Osborn |first=Henry F. |author-link=Henry Fairfield Osborn |year=1905 |title=Tyrannosaurus and other Cretaceous carnivorous dinosaurs |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=259\u2013265 |hdl=2246/1464 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-5965.2007.00735_17.x}} < /ref > {{rp|265}} The name honours [[Alberta]], the [[Canadian province]] established the same year, in which the first remains were found.

This specimen, found on June 9, 1884, was recovered by an expedition of the [[Geological Survey of Canada]], led by the famous [[geologist]] [[Joseph Tyrrell|Joseph Burr Tyrrell]]. Due to a lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could only be partially secured.

The Horseshoe Canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of ''D. aquilunguis'', type species of ''Dryptosaurus'', so Osborn created the new name ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' for them in 1905. He did not describe the remains in any great detail, citing Lambe's complete description the year before. < ref name=osborn1905/ >  Both specimens (the [[holotype]] CMN 5600 and the [[paratype]] CMN 5601) are stored in the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]] in [[Ottawa]].

However, in 2010, [[Thomas Carr (paleontologist)|Thomas Carr]] established that the holotype, the paratype and comparable later finds all shared a single common unique trait or [[autapomorphy]]: the possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the [[palatine bone]], proving that ''Albertosaurus'' was a valid [[taxon]]. < ref > {{cite journal | last1 = Carr | first1 = Thomas D. | year = 2010 | title = A taxonomic assessment of the type series of ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' and the identity of Tyrannosauridae (Dinosauria, Coelurosauria) in the ''Albertosaurus'' bonebed from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (Campanian\u2013Maastrichtian, Late Cretaceous) | journal = Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 9| pages = 1213\u20131226 | doi = 10.1139/e10-035 | bibcode = 2010CaJES..47.1213C }} < /ref > \n \n ===Dry Island bonebed=== \n [[File:Albertosaurus teeth - Royal Tyrrell Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|Teeth from Dry Island and Drumheller, [[Royal Tyrrell Museum]]]]  \n On 11 August 1910, American paleontologist [[Barnum Brown]] discovered the remains of a large group of ''Albertosaurus'' at another [[quarry]] alongside the Red Deer River. Because of the large number of bones and the limited time available, Brown's party did not collect every specimen, but made sure to collect remains from all of the individuals that they could identify in the [[bonebed]]. Among the bones deposited in the [[American Museum of Natural History]] collections in [[New York City]] are seven sets of right [[metatarsal]]s, along with two isolated toe bones that did not match any of the metatarsals in size. This indicated the presence of at least nine individuals in the quarry. Palaeontologist [[Philip J. Currie]] of the [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology]] rediscovered the bonebed in 1997 and resumed fieldwork at the site, which is now located inside [[Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park]]. < ref name=currie1998 > {{cite journal|last=Currie |first=Philip J. |author-link=Philip J.

Apart from the Dry Island bonebed, six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in Alberta and are housed in various Canadian museums: specimens RTMP 81.010.001, found in 1978 by amateur paleontologist Maurice Stefanuk; RTMP 85.098.001, found by Stefanuk on 16 June 1985; RTMP 86.64.001 (December 1985); RTMP 86.205.001 (1986); RTMP 97.058.0001 (1996); and CMN 11315.

Finding, largely due to a lack of good ''Albertosaurus'' skull material, no significant differences to separate the two taxa, [[Dale Russell]] declared the name ''Gorgosaurus'' a [[junior synonym]] of ''Albertosaurus'', which had been named first, and ''G. libratus'' was renamed ''Albertosaurus libratus'' in 1970. A species distinction was maintained because of the age difference. This addition extended the temporal range of the genus ''Albertosaurus'' backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres. < ref name=russell1970/ > \n \n In 2003, [[Philip J. Currie]], benefiting from much more extensive finds and a general increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and came to the conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought. The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are [[sister taxa]], more closely related to each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that ''Albertosaurus'' and ''Gorgosaurus'' be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than ''Daspletosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'', which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from [[Alaska]] and [[New Mexico]], and Currie suggested that the ''Albertosaurus''-''Gorgosaurus'' situation may be clarified once these are described fully. < ref name=currie2003b/ >  Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation, < ref name=holtz2004/ > < ref name=ericksonetal2004/ > < ref name=ricklefs2007 > {{cite journal |last=Ricklefs |first=Robert E. |year=2007 |title=Tyrannosaur ageing |journal=Biology Letters |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=214\u2013217 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0597 |pmid=17284406 |pmc=2375931}} < /ref >  but some have not. < ref name=carretal2005/ > \n \n ===Other species=== \n Apart from ''A. sarcophagus'', ''A. arctunguis'' and ''A. libratus'', several other species of ''Albertosaurus'' have been named.

Using bone [[histology]], the age of an individual animal at the time of death can often be determined, allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species. The youngest known ''Albertosaurus'' is a two-year-old discovered in the Dry Island bonebed, which would have weighed about 50 kilograms (110 & nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]) and measured slightly more than {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off}} in length. The {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=off}} specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known, at 28 years of age. When specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph, an ''S''-shaped growth curve results, with the most rapid growth occurring in a four-year period ending around the sixteenth year of life, a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The growth rate during this phase was {{convert|122|kg|lb|abbr=off}} per year, based on an adult 1.3 & nbsp;[[tonne]]s. Other studies have suggested higher adult weights; this would affect the magnitude of the growth rate, but not the overall pattern.

It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of [[Biological life cycle|life history]], rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile ''Albertosaurus'' are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did. < ref name=ericksonetal2006/ > \n \n A hypothesis of ''Albertosaurus'' life history postulates that [[hatchling]]s died in large numbers, but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction. After just two years, juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult ''Albertosaurus'', and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains. Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase, and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation, including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources, and eventually, the ever-increasing effects of [[senescence]]. The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation. Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. High infant mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching maximum size, is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals, including elephants, [[African buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than two-thirds of all ''Albertosaurus'' specimens are known from one locality. < ref name=ericksonetal2006/ > < ref name=ricklefs2007/ > < ref > {{cite journal | last1 = Erickson | first1 = Gregory M. | last2 = Currie | first2 = Philip J. | last3 = Inouye | first3 = Brian D. | last4 = Winn | first4 = Alice A. | year = 2010 | title = A revised life table and survivorship curve for ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' based on the Dry Island mass death assemblage | journal = Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 9| pages = 1269\u20131275 | doi = 10.1139/e10-051 | bibcode = 2010CaJES..47.1269E }} < /ref > \n \n ===Pack behaviour=== \n [[Image:Albertosaurus Tyrrell.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze sculptures of a pack, RTM, designed by Brian Cooley in 2007]] \n The Dry Island bonebed discovered by Barnum Brown and his crew contains the remains of 26 ''Albertosaurus'', the most individuals found in one locality of any large Cretaceous theropod, and the second-most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the ''[[Allosaurus]]'' assemblage at the [[Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]] in [[Utah]].

The leg proportions of the smaller individuals were comparable to those of [[ornithomimid]]s, which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs. Younger ''Albertosaurus'' were probably equally fleet-footed, or at least faster than their prey. Currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults, who were larger and more powerful, but also slower. < ref name=currie1998/ >  Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults, filling predator [[Ecological niche|niche]]s between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two [[orders of magnitude]] smaller than adult ''Albertosaurus'' in mass. < ref name=holtz2004/ >  A similar situation is observed in modern Komodo dragons, with hatchlings beginning life as small [[insectivore]]s before growing to become the dominant predators on their islands. < ref name=auffenberg1981 > {{cite book |last=Auffenberg |first=Walter |author-link=Walter Auffenberg|year=2000 |title=The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor |publisher=University Press of Florida |location=Gainesville |isbn=978-0-8130-0621-5}} < /ref >  However, as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is exceedingly rare, these ideas cannot readily be tested. In 2010, Currie, though still favouring the hunting pack hypothesis, admitted that the concentration could have been brought about by other causes, such as a slowly rising water level during an extended flood. < ref > {{cite journal | last1 = Currie | first1 = Philip J. | last2 = Eberth | first2 = David A. | year = 2010 | title = On gregarious behavior in ''Albertosaurus'' | journal = Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 9| pages = 1277\u20131289 | doi = 10.1139/e10-072 | bibcode = 2010CaJES..47.1277C }} < /ref > \n \n ===Palaeopathology=== \n [[File:Common-Avian-Infection-Plagued-the-Tyrant-Dinosaurs-pone.0007288.g002.jpg|thumb|Tyrannosaur jaw-bones with [[trichomonosis]]-type lesions; D (upper right) is ''Albertosaurus'']] \n In 2009, researchers hypothesized that smooth-edged holes found in the fossil jaws of [[tyrannosaurid]] dinosaurs such as ''Albertosaurus'' were caused by a parasite similar to ''[[Trichomonas]] gallinae'', which infects birds. < ref name=Wolff2009 > {{cite journal| year = 2009|author1=Wolff, Ewan D.

Most specimens showed no sign of disease. On three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs, consisting of abnormal ossifications of the tendons, so-called [[enthesophyte]]s, were present, their cause unknown. Two ribs and a belly-rib showed signs of breaking and healing. One adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks. The low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a ''[[Majungasaurus]]'' population of which it in 2007 was established that 19% of individuals showed bone pathologies. < ref > {{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = Phil R. | year = 2010 | title = Palaeopathological changes in a population of ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' from the Upper Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada | journal = Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 9| pages = 1263\u20131268 | doi = 10.1139/e10-030 | bibcode = 2010CaJES..47.1263B }} < /ref > \n \n ==Palaeoecology== \n [[Image:Horseshoe Canyon Alberta Nov 1988.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] is exposed in its [[Type locality (geology)|type section]] at [[Horseshoe Canyon (Alberta)|Horseshoe Canyon]], [[Alberta]]]] \n Most fossils of ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' are known from the upper [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] in Alberta. These younger units of this [[geologic formation]] date to the early [[Maastrichtian]] stage of the [[Late Cretaceous]] Period, 70 to 68 [[Mega-annum|Ma]] (million years ago). Immediately below this formation is the [[Bearpaw Shale]], a [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] formation representing a section of the [[Western Interior Seaway]]. The seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided towards the end of the Cretaceous, exposing land that had previously been underwater. It was not a smooth process, however, and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout Horseshoe Canyon before finally receding altogether in the years after. Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and near-shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like [[lagoon]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]] and [[tidal flat]]s. Numerous [[coal]] seams represent ancient [[peat]] [[swamp]]s. Like most of the other [[vertebrate]] fossils from the formation, ''Albertosaurus'' remains are found in deposits laid down in the [[river delta|deltas]] and [[floodplain]]s of large rivers during the later half of Horseshoe Canyon times. < ref name=eberth1997 > {{cite book |last=Eberth |first=David A. |year=1997 |chapter=Edmonton Group |editor=Currie, Philip J. |editor-link=Philip J.

[[Shark]]s, [[Batoidea|rays]], [[sturgeon]]s, [[bowfin]]s, [[gar]]s and the gar-like ''[[Aspidorhynchus]]'' made up the fish fauna. Mammals included [[multituberculate]]s and the [[marsupial]] ''[[Didelphodon]]''. The saltwater [[plesiosaur]] ''[[Leurospondylus]]'' has been found in marine sediments in the Horseshoe Canyon, while freshwater environments were populated by [[turtle]]s, ''[[Champsosaurus]]'', and [[crocodilia]]ns like ''[[Leidyosuchus]]'' and ''[[Stangerochampsa]]''. Dinosaurs dominate the fauna, especially hadrosaurs, which make up half of all dinosaurs known, including the genera ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', ''[[Saurolophus]]'' and ''[[Hypacrosaurus]]''. Ceratopsians and [[ornithomimid]]s were also very common, together making up another third of the known fauna. Along with much rarer [[ankylosauria]]ns and [[pachycephalosaur]]s, all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods, including [[troodontid]]s, [[dromaeosaurid]]s, and [[caenagnathid]]s. < ref name=eberth1997/ > < ref > {{cite journal | last1 = Larson | first1 = Derek W. | last2 = Brinkman | first2 = Donald B. | last3 = Bell | first3 = Phil R. | year = 2010 | title = Faunal assemblages from the upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation, an early Maastrichtian cool-climate assemblage from Alberta, with special reference to the ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' bonebed | journal = Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 9| pages = 1159\u20131181 | doi = 10.1139/e10-005 | bibcode = 2010CaJES..47.1159L }} < /ref >  Intermingled with the ''Albertosaurus'' remains of the Dry Island bonebed, the bones of the small theropod ''[[Albertonykus]]'' were found. < ref name=LC08 > {{cite journal |last=Longrich |first=Nicholas R. |author2=Currie, Philip J. |year=2009 |title=''Albertonykus borealis'', a new alvarezsaur (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Early Maastrichtian of Alberta, Canada: Implications for the systematics and ecology of the Alvarezsauridae |journal=Cretaceous Research |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages= 239\u2013252|doi=10.1016/j.cretres.2008.07.005 }} < /ref >  Adult ''Albertosaurus'' were the [[apex predator]]s in this environment, with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile albertosaurs. < ref name=eberth1997/ > \n \n ==See also== \n * [[Timeline of tyrannosaur research]] \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n \n ==External links== \n * {{commons category-inline|Albertosaurus}} \n \n {{featured article}} \n {{Theropoda|C.}} \n {{Taxonbar|from=Q40751}} \n {{Portal bar|Dinosaurs|Cretaceous|Canada}} \n \n [[Category:Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of North America]] \n [[Category:Tyrannosaurids]] \n [[Category:Fossil taxa described in 1905]] \n [[Category:Taxa named by Henry Fairfield Osborn]] \n [[Category:Maastrichtian life]] \n [[Category:Paleontology in Alberta]] \n [[Category:Maastrichtian genus first appearances]] \n [[Category:Maastrichtian genus extinctions]] \n [[Category:Horseshoe Canyon fauna]]"
