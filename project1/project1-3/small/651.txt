This view is reflected in the canon of [[Melito of Sardis]], and in the prefaces and letters of Jerome. A third view was that the books were not as valuable as the canonical scriptures of the Hebrew collection, but were of value for moral uses, as introductory texts for new converts from [[paganism]], and to be read in congregations. They were referred to as  \" [[ecclesiastical]] \"  works by [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]. < ref name=EB1911 / > \n \n In 1546 the Catholic [[Council of Trent]] reconfirmed the canon of Augustine, dating to the second and third centuries, declaring  \" He is also to be anathema who does not receive these entire books, with all their parts, as they have been accustomed to be read in the Catholic Church, and are found in the ancient editions of the Latin [[Vulgate]], as sacred and canonical. \"  The whole of the books in question, with the exception of [[1 Esdras]] and [[2 Esdras]] and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], were declared canonical at Trent. < ref name=EB1911 / >  The Protestants, in comparison,  were diverse in their opinion of the deuterocanon early on.

As today (but along with others reasons), < ref name= \" Wegner \" / >   various reformers argued that those books contained doctrinal or other errors and thus should not have been added to the canon for that reason. The differences between canons can be seen under [[Biblical canon#Old Testament|Biblical canon]] and [[Development of the Christian biblical canon]].   \n   \n Explaining the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Church's canon is made difficult because of differences of perspective with the [[Roman Catholic]] church in the interpretation of how it was done.  Those differences (in matters of jurisdictional authority) were contributing factors in the [[East-West Schism|separation of the Roman Catholics and Orthodox]] around 1054, but the formation of the canon which Trent would later officially definitively settle was largely complete by the fifth century, in not settled, six centuries before the separation.  In the eastern part of the church, it took much of the fifth century also to come to agreement, but in the end it was accomplished.  The canonical books thus established by the undivided church became the predominate canon for what was later to become Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox alike.  The East did already differ from the West in not considering every question of canon yet settled, and it subsequently adopted a few more books into its Old Testament.  It also allowed consideration of yet a few more to continue not fully decided, which led in some cases to adoption in one or more jurisdictions, but not all.  Thus, there are today a few remaining differences of canon among Orthodox, and all Orthodox accept a few more books than appear in the Catholic canon. The [[Psalms of Solomon]],  [[3 Maccabees]], [[4 Maccabees]], the [[Epistle of Jeremiah]]  the [[Book of Odes (Bible)|Book of Odes]], the  [[Prayer of Manasseh]] and [[Psalm 151]] are included in some copies of the Septuagint, < ref > {{cite web|title=The Old Testament Canon and Apocrypha|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/canon2.html|website=BibleResearcher|access-date=27 November 2015}} < /ref >  some of which are accepted as canonical by Eastern Orthodox and some other churches.   Protestants accept none of these additional books as canon either, but see them having roughly the same status as the other Apocrypha. \n \n ===New Testament apocrypha=== \n {{Main|New Testament apocrypha}} \n New Testament apocrypha\u2014books similar to those in the [[New Testament]] but almost universally rejected by Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants\u2014include several gospels and lives of apostles.

Many texts believed lost for centuries were unearthed in the 19th and 20th centuries, producing lively speculation about their importance in early [[Christianity]] among religious scholars,{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} while many others survive only in the form of quotations from them in other writings; for some, no more than the title is known. Artists and theologians have drawn upon the New Testament apocrypha for such matters as the names of [[Dismas]] and [[Gestas]] and details about the [[Three Wise Men]]. The first explicit mention of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] is found in the [[pseudepigraphical]] [[Infancy Gospel of James]]. \n \n Before the fifth century, the Christian writings that were then under discussion for inclusion in the canon but had not yet been accepted were classified in a group known as the ancient [[antilegomena]]e.  These were all candidates for the New Testament and included several books which were eventually accepted, such as: [[The Epistle to the Hebrews]], [[2 Peter]], [[3 John]] and the [[Revelation of John]] (Apocalypse).  None of those accepted books can be considered Apocryphal now, since all Christendom accepts them as canonical.  Of the uncanonized ones, the Early Church considered some heretical but viewed others quite well.  Some Christians, in an extension of the meaning, might also consider the non-heretical books to be  \" apocryphal \"  along the manner of Martin Luther: not canon, but useful to read.  This category includes books such as the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], the [[Didache]], and [[The Shepherd of Hermas]] which are sometimes referred to as the [[Apostolic Fathers]]. \n The [[Gnosticism|Gnostic tradition]] was a prolific source of apocryphal gospels. < ref name=EB1911 / >  While these writings borrowed the characteristic poetic features of apocalyptic literature from Judaism, Gnostic sects largely insisted on allegorical interpretations based on a secret apostolic tradition. With them, these apocryphal books were highly esteemed. A well-known Gnostic apocryphal book is the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the only complete text of which was found in the Egyptian town of [[Nag Hammadi]] in 1945. The [[Gospel of Judas]], a Gnostic gospel, also received much media attention when it was reconstructed in 2006. \n \n Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians as well as Protestants generally agree on the canon of the [[New Testament]], see [[Development of the New Testament canon]]. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] have in the past also included [[Epistles of Clement (disambiguation)|I  &  II Clement]] and [[Shepherd of Hermas]] in their [[New Testament]] canon. \n \n ====List of Sixty==== \n The List of Sixty, dating to around the 7th century, lists the sixty books of the Bible. The unknown author also lists several apocryphal books that are not included amongst the sixty. These books are: < ref name=ISBE/ > \n {{div col|colwidth=23em}} \n * [[Books of Adam|Adam]] \n * [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]] \n * [[Genesis Apocryphon|Lamech]] \n * [[Twelve Patriarchs]] \n * [[Prayer of Joseph]] \n * [[Eldad and Modad]] \n * [[Testament of Moses]] \n * [[Assumption of Moses]] \n * [[Psalms of Solomon]] \n * [[Apocalypse of Elijah]] \n * [[Ascension of Isaiah]] \n * [[Apocalypse of Zephaniah]] \n * [[Apocalypse of Zechariah]] \n * [[Greek Apocalypse of Ezra|Apocalyptic Ezra]] \n * [[History of James]] \n * [[Apocalypse of Peter]] \n * [[Itinerary and Teaching of the Apostles]] \n * [[Epistle of Barnabas]] \n * [[Acts of Paul]] \n * [[Apocalypse of Paul]] \n * [[Didascalia of Clement]] \n * [[Didascalia of Ignatius]] \n * [[Didascalia of Polycarp]] \n * Gospel According to Barnabas{{efn|See also [[Gospel of Barnabas]]}} \n * Gospel According to Matthew{{efn|See also [[Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew]]}} \n {{div col end}} \n \n ==Taoism== \n Prophetic texts called the ''Ch'an-wei'' ([[:zh:\u8b96\u7def]]) were written by [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC to AD 220) [[Daoshi|Taoist priests]] to legitimize as well as curb imperial power. < ref name= \" autogenerated1 \" > Seidel, Anna.  \" Imperial treasures and Taoist sacraments \" , in M. Strickmann, ed., Tantric and Taoist Studies in Honor of Rolf A. Stein, II, Bruxelles, Institut belge des hautes etudes chinoises. 291\u2013371. < /ref >  They deal with treasure objects that were part of the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] (1066 to 256 BC) royal treasures. Emerging from the instability of the [[Warring States period]] (476\u2013221 BC), ancient Chinese scholars saw the centralized rule of the Zhou as an ideal model for the new Han empire to emulate. \n \n The ''Ch'an-wei'' are texts written by Han scholars about the Zhou royal treasures, only they were not written to record history for its own sake, but for legitimizing the current imperial reign. These texts took the form of stories about texts and objects being conferred upon the Emperors by Heaven and comprising these ancient sage-king's (this is how the Zhou emperors were referred to by this time, about 500 years after their peak) royal regalia. < ref name=autogenerated1 / >  The desired effect was to confirm the Han emperor's [[Mandate of Heaven|Heavenly Mandate]] through the continuity offered by his possession of these same sacred talismans. \n \n It is because of this politicized recording of their history that it is difficult to retrace the exact origins of these objects. What is known is that these texts were most likely produced by a class of literati called the ''[[fangshi]]''. These were a class of nobles who were not part of the state administration; they were considered specialists or occultists, for example diviners, astrologers, alchemists or healers. < ref name=autogenerated1 / >  It is from this class of nobles that the first [[Taoist]] priests are believed to have emerged. [[Seidel, Anna|Seidel]] points out however that the scarcity of sources relating to the formation of early [[Taoism]] make the exact link between the apocryphal texts and the Taoist beliefs unclear. < ref name=autogenerated1 / > \n \n ==See also== \n * [[List of Gospels]] \n * [[Lost work]] \n * [[Occult]] \n * [[Shakespeare apocrypha]] \n \n == Notes == \n {{notelist}} \n \n == References == \n === Citations === \n {{Reflist}} \n \n === Sources === \n {{refbegin}} \n * {{EB1911 |first = Robert Henry |last = Charles |wstitle = Apocryphal Literature |volume = 2 |pages = 175\u2013183 }} \n {{refend}} \n \n ==External links== \n {{Wiktionary|apocrypha}} \n {{wikiquote}} \n {{Commons category|Apocrypha}} \n * [http://alinsuciu.com/ Alin Suciu's blog on various Coptic apocrypha] \n * [http://wn.elib.com/Library/Religious/AP/Apocry_index.html ''The Apocrypha''] is in the religion section at the e.Lib. \n * [http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/noncanon/index.htm Noncanonical Literature] \n * [https://web.archive.org/web/20040614161145/http://www.comparative-religion.com/christianity/apocrypha/ Complete NT Apocrypha] Claims to be the largest collection of New Testament apocrypha online \n * [http://st-takla.org/pub_Deuterocanon/Deuterocanon-Apocrypha_El-Asfar_El-Kanoneya_El-Tanya__0-index.html Deuterocanonical books] - Full text from Saint Takla Haymanot Church Website (also presents the full text in Arabic) \n * [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/apocrypha LDS Bible Dictionary - Apocrypha] \u2013 Definition  &  LDS POV, including brief book descriptions. \n * [https://archive.org/details/AldenicumTheTrilogy/ Aldenicum The Trilogy], an apocryphal view on life and reality around us. \n * [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=a & word=APOCRYPHA Christian Cyclopedia article on Apocrypha] \n * [https://web.archive.org/web/20071014070146/http://bombaxo.com/allusions.html New Testament Allusions to Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha] \n * [http://www.biblestudymagazine.com/interactive/canon/ Canon Comparison Chart] \n * {{Cite AmCyc |last=Schem |first=A.
