The ethnic distribution consists of 91% Black  &  Mulatto, 4.4% mixed race, 1.7% White, and 2.9% other (primarily [[South Asians|East Indian]] and other Asian). Most Whites are of British descent.

A minority of Antiguan residents are immigrants from other countries, particularly from Dominica, Guyana and [[Jamaica]], and, increasingly, from the Dominican Republic, [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] and [[Nigeria]].

Generally, the upper and middle classes shun Antiguan Creole. The educational system dissuades the use of Antiguan Creole and instruction is done in Standard (British) English. \n \n Many of the words used in the Antiguan dialect are derived from [[British English|British]] as well as African languages. This can be easily seen in phrases such as:  \" Ent it? \"  meaning  \" Ain't it? \"  which is itself dialectal and means  \" Isn't it? \" . Common island [[proverb]]s can often be traced to Africa. \n \n Spanish is spoken by around 10,000 inhabitants. < ref > Farquhar, Bernadette, [http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/BNCCde/antigua/conference/papers/farquhar.html  \" The Spanish Language in Antigua and Barbuda: Implications for Language Planning and Language Research \" ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715015910/http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/BNCCde/antigua/conference/papers/farquhar.html |date=15 July 2013 }} < /ref > \n \n ===Religion=== \n [[File:Stjohnscathedralantigua.jpg|thumb|[[St. John's Cathedral, St. John's]]]] \n \n A majority (77%) < ref name=Factbook / >  of Antiguans are Christians, with the [[Anglicans]] (17.6%) being the largest single denomination.

The Queen is currently represented by Governor-General [[Rodney Williams (politician)|Sir Rodney Williams]]. A council of ministers is appointed by the governor general on the advice of the [[List of Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda|prime minister]], currently [[Gaston Browne]] (2014\u2013). < ref name=FactbookAttribution/ >  The prime minister is the [[head of government]]. \n \n [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government while [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the two Chambers of [[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|Parliament]].

Bird, the nation's first Prime Minister, is credited with having brought Antigua and Barbuda and the Caribbean into a new era of independence. Prime Minister [[Lester Bird|Lester Bryant Bird]] succeeded the elder Bird in 1994. \n \n \n ====Party elections==== \n [[Gaston Browne]] defeated his predecessor [[Lester Bryant Bird]] at the Antigua Labour Party's biennial convention in November 2012 held to elect a political leader and other officers. The party then altered its name from the [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP) to the Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party (ABLP). This was done to officially include the party's presence on the sister island of Barbuda in its organisation, the only political party on the mainland to have a physical branch in Barbuda. \n \n === Judiciary === \n The Judicial branch is the [[Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court]] (based in Saint Lucia; one judge of the Supreme Court is a resident of the islands and presides over the High Court of Justice).
