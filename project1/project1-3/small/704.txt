Until modern times, there was no clear distinction between architect and [[Civil engineering|engineer]]. In Europe, the titles ''architect'' and ''engineer'' were primarily geographical variations that referred to the same person, often used interchangeably. < ref > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQYeHMGp2gwC & q=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance|title=The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance|editor-first=Jacob|editor-last=Burckhardt|editor-link=Jacob Burckhardt|isbn=0-8052-1082-2|publisher=[[Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group]]|year=1986|page=242|first=Peter|last=Murray|author-link=Peter Murray (art historian)}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.smweng.com/civil-engineering-definitions-and-history/civil-engineering-defined|title=Civil Engineering Defined - Civil Engineering Definitions and History|work=smweng.com|access-date=8 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425135327/http://www.smweng.com/civil-engineering-definitions-and-history/civil-engineering-defined|archive-date=25 April 2012|url-status=live}} < /ref > [[File:Masaccio, cappella brancacci, san pietro in cattedra. ritratto di filippo brunelleschi.jpg|thumb|[[Filippo Brunelleschi]] is revered as one of the most inventive and gifted architects in history. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://totallyhistory.com/filippo-brunelleschi|title=Filippo Brunelleschi|work=Totally History|access-date=8 March 2019}} < /ref > ]] It is suggested that various developments in technology and mathematics allowed the development of the professional 'gentleman' architect, separate from the hands-on craftsman. Paper was not used in Europe for drawing until the 15th century but became increasingly available after 1500. Pencils were used more often for drawing by 1600.

Such licensure usually requires a university degree, successful completion of exams, as well as a training period. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.ncarb.org/become-architect/basics|title=The Basics|date=2017-01-23|website=NCARB - National Council of Architectural Registration Boards|language=en|access-date=2020-04-29}} < /ref >  Representation of oneself as an architect through the use of terms and titles is restricted to licensed individuals by law, although in general, derivatives such as [[architectural designer]] are often not legally protected. \n \n To practice architecture implies the ability to practice independently of supervision. The term ''[[building design]] professional'' (or ''design professional)'', by contrast, is a much broader term that includes professionals who practice independently under an alternate profession, such as [[engineering]] professionals, or those who assist in the practice of architecture under the supervision of a licensed architect such as [[intern architect]]s. In many places, independent, non-licensed individuals may perform design services outside the professional restrictions, such design houses and other smaller structures. \n \n ==Practice== \n In the architectural profession, technical and environmental knowledge, design and construction management, and an understanding of business are as important as design. However, the design is the driving force throughout the project and beyond. An architect accepts a commission from a client. The commission might involve preparing feasibility reports, building audits, the design of a building or of several buildings, structures, and the spaces among them. The architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building. Throughout the project (planning to occupancy), the architect coordinates a design team. [[Structural engineer|Structural]], [[mechanical engineer|mechanical]], and [[electrical engineer]]s and other specialists are hired by the client or the architect, who must ensure that the work is coordinated to construct the design. \n \n ===Design role=== \n The architect, once hired by a client, is responsible for creating a design concept that both meets the requirements of that client and provides a facility suitable to the required use. The architect must meet with, and question, the client in order to ascertain all the requirements (and nuances) of the planned project.  < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://studentscholarships.org/salary/556/architects.php|title=Architects - What do Architects do?|website=StudentScholarships.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-29}} < /ref > \n \n Often the full brief is not entirely clear at the beginning: entailing a degree of risk in the design undertaking. The architect may make early proposals to the client, which may rework the very terms of the brief. The  \" program \"  (or brief) is essential to producing a project that meets all the needs of the owner. This then is a guide for the architect in creating the design concept. \n \n Design proposal(s) are generally expected to be both imaginative and pragmatic. Depending on the place, time, finance, culture, and available crafts and technology in which the design takes place, the precise extent and nature of these expectations will vary. \n \n Foresight is a prerequisite as designing buildings is a very complex and demanding undertaking.  \n \n Any design concept must at a very early stage in its generation take into account a great number of issues and variables which include qualities of space(s), < ref > {{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/2061334 |title=Space: The undefinable space of architecture |first=Erdem |last=\u00dcng\u00fcr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219053520/http://www.academia.edu/2061334/Space_The_undefinable_space_of_architecture |archive-date=19 December 2016 |via=[[Academia.edu]] |pages=12 |access-date=8 March 2019 |url-status=live }} < /ref >  the end-use and life-cycle of these proposed spaces, connections, relations, and aspects between spaces including how they are put together as well as the impact of proposals on the immediate and wider locality. Selection of appropriate materials and technology must be considered, tested and reviewed at an early stage in the design to ensure there are no setbacks (such as higher-than-expected costs) which may occur later. The site and its environs, as well as the culture and history of the place, will also influence the design. The design must also countenance increasing concerns with environmental sustainability. The architect may introduce (intentionally or not), to greater or lesser degrees, aspects of [[mathematics and architecture]], new or current [[architectural theory]], or references to [[architectural history]]. \n \n A key part of the design is that the architect often consults with engineers, surveyors and other specialists throughout the design, ensuring that aspects such as the structural supports and air conditioning elements are coordinated in the scheme as a whole. The control and planning of construction costs are also a part of these consultations. Coordination of the different aspects involves a high degree of specialized communication, including advanced computer technology such as BIM ([[Building Information Modeling]]), CAD, and cloud-based technologies. \n \n At all times in the design, the architect reports back to the client who may have reservations or recommendations, introducing a further variable into the design. \n \n Architects deal with local and federal jurisdictions about regulations and [[building code]]s. The architect might need to comply with local [[Urban planning|planning]] and [[zoning]] laws, such as required setbacks, height limitations, parking requirements, transparency requirements (windows), and [[land use]]. Some established jurisdictions require adherence to design and [[historic preservation]] guidelines. Health and safety risks form a vital part of the current design, and in many jurisdictions, design reports and records are required which include ongoing considerations such as materials and contaminants, waste management and recycling, traffic control and fire safety. \n \n ====Means of design==== \n \n Previously, architects employed drawings < ref name= \" MAD 225 \" / >  to illustrate and generate design proposals. While conceptual sketches are still widely used by architects, < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.archdaily.com/639533/17-napkin-sketches-by-famous-architects |title=17 Napkin Sketches by Famous Architects |date=5 June 2015 |access-date=8 March 2019 |first=Karissa |last=Rosenfield |work=[[ArchDaily]] |issn=0719-8884}} < /ref >  computer technology has now become the industry standard. < ref > {{cite journal |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/architecture/2011/03/think_before_you_build.html |title=Think Before You Build |first=Witold |last=Rybczynski |date=30 March 2011 |journal=[[Slate.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614053149/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/architecture/2011/03/think_before_you_build.html |archive-date=14 June 2018 |publisher=[[The Slate Group]] |agency=[[Graham Holdings Company]] |access-date=8 December 2015 |url-status=live }} < /ref >  However, design may include the use of photos, collages, prints, linocuts, [[3D scanning]] technology and other media in design production.  \n Increasingly, computer software such as [[BIM]] is shaping how architects work. BIM technology allows for the creation of a virtual building that serves as an information database for the sharing of design and building information throughout the life-cycle of the building's design, construction and maintenance. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php#faq1 |title=Frequently Asked Questions About the National BIM Standard-United States |work=National BIM Standard |access-date=17 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016190503/http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php#faq1 |archive-date=16 October 2014 |publisher=[[National Institute of Building Sciences]]}} < /ref >  [[Virtual reality]] (VR) presentations are becoming more common for visualizing structural designs and interior spaces from a point-of-view perspective. \n \n ===Environmental role=== \n As current buildings are now known to be high emitters of carbon into the atmosphere, increasing controls are being placed on buildings and associated technology to reduce emissions, increase energy efficiency, and make use of renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources may be developed within the proposed building or via local or national renewable energy providers. As a result, the architect is required to remain abreast of current regulations that are continually tightening. Some new developments exhibit extremely low energy use. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://passipedia.org/basics/what_is_a_passive_house|title=What is a Passive House? [ ]|website=passipedia.org}} < /ref > \n However, the architect is also increasingly required to provide initiatives in a wider environmental sense, such as making provision for low-energy transport, natural daylighting instead of artificial lighting, natural ventilation instead of air conditioning, pollution, and waste management, use of recycled materials and employment of materials which can be easily recycled in the future. \n \n ===Construction role=== \n As the design becomes more advanced and detailed, specifications and detail designs are made of all the elements and components of the building. Techniques in the production of a building are continually advancing which places a demand on the architect to ensure that he or she remains up to date with these advances. \n \n Depending on the client's needs and the jurisdiction's requirements, the spectrum of the architect's services during construction stages may be extensive (detailed document preparation and construction review) or less involved (such as allowing a contractor to exercise considerable [[design-build]] functions). \n \n Architects typically put projects to [[Call for bids|tender]] on behalf of their clients, advise on the award of the project to a [[general contractor]], facilitate and then administer a contract of agreement which is often between the client and the contractor. This contract is legally binding and covers a very wide range of aspects including the insurances and commitments of all stakeholders, the status of the design documents, provisions for the architect's access, and procedures for the control of the works as they proceed. Depending on the type of contract utilized, provisions for further sub-contract tenders may be required. The architect may require that some elements are covered by a warranty which specifies the expected life and other aspects of the material, product or work. \n \n In most jurisdictions, prior notification to the relevant local authority must be given before commencement on site, thus giving the local authority notice to carry out independent inspections. The architect will then review and inspect the progress of the work in coordination with the local authority. \n \n The architect will typically review contractor [[shop drawings]] and other [[Submittals (construction)|submittals]], prepare and issue site instructions, and provide Certificates for Payment to the contractor (see also [[Design-bid-build]]) which is based on the work done to date as well as any materials and other goods purchased or hired. In the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries, a [[quantity surveyor]] is often part of the team to provide cost consulting. With very large, complex projects, an independent [[Construction management|construction manager]] is sometimes hired to assist in the design and to manage construction. \n \n In many jurisdictions, mandatory certification or assurance of the completed work or part of works is required. This demand for certification entails a high degree of risk - therefore, regular inspections of the work as it progresses on site is required to ensure that is in compliance with the design itself as well as with all relevant statutes and permissions. \n \n ===Alternate practice and specializations=== \n Recent decades have seen the rise of specializations within the profession. Many architects and architectural firms focus on certain project types (for example, healthcare, retail, public housing, event management), technological expertise or project delivery methods. Some architects specialize as building code, [[building envelope]], [[Sustainable architecture|sustainable design]], [[technical writing]], historic preservation(US) or conservation (UK), [[accessibility]] and other forms of specialist consultants. \n \n Many architects elect to move into [[real estate development|real estate (property) development]], corporate facilities planning, [[project management]], construction management, [[interior design]], city planning, or other related fields. \n \n ==Professional requirements== \n {{Main article|Professional requirements for architects}} \n {{See also|Architectural engineering#Architect}} \n \n Although there are variations from place to place, most of the world's architects are required to register with the appropriate jurisdiction. To do so, architects are typically required to meet three common requirements: education, experience, and examination. \n \n Educational requirements generally consist of a [[university degree]] in architecture. The experience requirement for degree candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship (usually two to three years, depending on jurisdiction). Finally, a Registration Examination or a series of exams is required prior to licensure. \n \n Professionals engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late 19th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting. Instead, they often trained under established architects. Prior to modern times, there was no distinction between architects, [[engineer]]s and often [[artist]]s,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} and the title used varied depending on geographical location. They often carried the title of [[master builder (occupation)|master builder]] or [[Surveying|surveyor]]{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} after serving a number of years as an apprentice (such as Sir [[Christopher Wren]]). The formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole, serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory. \n \n ==Fees== \n Architects' fee structures are typically based on a percentage of construction value, as a rate per unit area of the proposed construction, hourly rates or a fixed lump sum fee. Combinations of these structures are also common. Fixed fees are usually based on a project's allocated construction cost and can range between 4 and 12% of new construction cost, for commercial and institutional projects, depending on a project's size and complexity. Residential projects range from 12 to 20%. Renovation projects typically command higher percentages, as high as 15-20%. \n \n Overall billings for [[architectural firm]]s range widely, depending on location and economic climate. Billings have traditionally been dependent on the local economic conditions but, with rapid globalization, this is becoming less of a factor for larger international firms. Salaries also vary, depending on experience, position within the firm (staff architect, partner, or shareholder, etc.), and the size and location of the firm. \n \n ==Professional organizations== \n {{main article|List of professional architecture organizations}} \n A number of national professional organizations exist to promote career and business development in architecture. \n \n * The [[International Union of Architects]] (UIA) \n * The [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) USA \n * [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) UK \n * Architects Registration Board (ARB) UK \n * The [[Australian Institute of Architects]] (AIA) Australia \n * The [[South African Institute of Architects]] (SAIA) South Africa \n * Association of Consultant Architects (ACA) UK  < ref > [http://acarchitects.co.uk/ Association of Consultant Architects] < /ref > \n * Association of Licensed Architects (ALA) USA \n * The Consejo Profesional de Arquitectura y Urbanismo (CPAU) Argentina \n * [[Indian Institute of Architects]] (IIA)  &  [[Council of Architecture]] (COA) India \n \n ==Prizes, awards == \n {{main article|List of architecture prizes}} \n [[File:Zaha Hadid in Heydar Aliyev Cultural center in Baku nov 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Zaha Hadid]], winner of the 2004 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].]] \n A wide variety of [[List of architecture prizes|prizes]] is awarded by national professional associations and other bodies, recognizing accomplished architects, their buildings, structures, and professional careers. \n \n The most lucrative award an architect can receive is the [[Pritzker Prize]], sometimes termed the  \" [[Nobel Prize]] for architecture. \"  Other prestigious architectural awards are the [[Royal Gold Medal]], the [[AIA Gold Medal]] (USA), AIA Gold Medal (Australia), and the [[Praemium Imperiale]]. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.arch2o.com/5-architectural-awards/|title=5 Highly Prestigious Awards in Architecture That You Should Know|date=2016-11-07|website=Arch2O.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-30}} < /ref > \n \n Architects in the UK, who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, might until 1971 be elected Fellows of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] and can write [[FRIBA]] after their name if they feel so inclined. Those elected to chartered membership of the RIBA after 1971 may use the initials RIBA but cannot use the old ARIBA and FRIBA. An Honorary Fellow may use the initials, Hon. FRIBA. and an International Fellow may use the initials Int. FRIBA.  Architects in the US, who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, are elected Fellows of the American Institute of Architects and can write [[FAIA]] after their name. Architects in Canada, who have made outstanding contributions to the profession through contribution to research, scholarship, public service, or professional standing to the good of architecture in Canada, or elsewhere, may be recognized as a Fellow of the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] and can write FRAIC after their name. In Hong Kong, those elected to chartered membership may use the initial HKIA, and those who have made a special contribution after nomination and election by The Hong Kong Institute of Architects (HKIA), may be elected as fellow members of HKIA and may use FHKIA after their name. \n \n Architects in the [[Philippines]] and [[Overseas Filipinos|Filipino communities overseas]] (whether they are Filipinos or not), especially those who also profess other jobs at the same time, are addressed and introduced as ''Architect'', rather than ''Sir/Madam'' in speech or ''Mr./Mrs./Ms.'' (''G./Gng./Bb.'' in Filipino) before surnames. That word is used either in itself or before the given name or surname. \n \n ==See also== \n {{Portal|Architecture}} \n < !-- New links inalphabetical order please -- > \n {{Columns-list|colwidth=30em| \n *[[Architectural designer]] \n *[[Architectural drawing]] \n *[[Architectural engineering]] \n *[[Architectural technologist]] \n *[[Building officials]] \n *[[Chartered architect]] \n *[[Civil engineer]] \n *[[Construction engineering]] \n *[[Construction management|Construction manager]] \n *[[Drafter]] \n *[[Expression (architecture)]] \n *[[Landscape architect]] \n *[[List of architects]] \n *[[Starchitect]] \n *[[State architect]] \n *[[Structural engineering]] \n *[[Urban design]]er \n *[[Urban planner]] \n *[[Women in architecture]] \n }} \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n \n {{Wikiquote|Architects}} \n {{Wikidata property|P84}} \n {{commons}} \n {{Authority control}} \n {{Construction overview}} \n \n [[Category:Architects]] \n [[Category:Architecture occupations]] \n [[Category:Professional certification in architecture]]"
