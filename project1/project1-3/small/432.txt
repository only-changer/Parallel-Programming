  "Amateur",
  "{{Other uses}} \n \n An '''amateur''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u00e6|m|\u0259|tj|\u0259r|_|-|tj|\u028a\u0259r}}; {{IPA-fr|amat\u0153\u0281|lang}}; {{literal translation|lover [of something]}}) is generally considered a person who pursues a particular activity or field of study independently from their source of income. Amateurs and their pursuits are also described as popular, informal, [[autodidacticism|self-taught]], [[user-generated]], [[do it yourself|DIY]], and [[hobby]]ist. < ref > {{cite web |url=http://arts.berkeley.edu/amateurism-across-the-arts-march-9/ |title=Amateurism Across the Arts |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |website=arts.berkeley.edu |access-date=May 15, 2018}} < /ref > \n \n == History == \n Historically, the amateur was considered to be the ideal balance between pure intent, open mind, and the interest or passion for a subject. That ideology spanned many different fields of interest. It may have its roots in the [[ancient Greek philosophy]] of [[Amateur sports|amateur athletes]] competing in the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]]. The ancient Greek citizens spent most of their time in other pursuits, but competed according to their natural talents and abilities. \n \n The  \" gentleman amateur \"  was a phenomenon among the [[gentry]] of [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] from the 17th century until the 20th century. < ref > {{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Duncan|title=Deconstructing the Gentleman Amateur (article version)|url=https://www.academia.edu/34556804/Deconstructing_the_Gentleman_Amateur_article_version_|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=May 16, 2018|language=en}} < /ref >  With the start of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]], with people thinking more about how the world works around them, (see [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment]]), things like the [[Cabinet of Curiosities]], and the writing of the book ''[[The Christian Virtuoso]]'', started to shape the idea of the gentleman amateur. He was vastly interested in a particular topic, and studied, observed, and collected things and information on his topic of choice. The [[Royal Society]] in Great Britain was generally composed of these  \" gentleman amateurs \" , and is one of the reasons science today exists the way it does. A few examples of these gentleman amateurs are [[Francis Bacon]], [[Isaac Newton]], and [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington]]. \n \n Amateurism can be seen in both a negative and positive light. Since amateurs often lack formal training, some amateur work may be considered sub-par. For example, amateur athletes in sports such as [[basketball]], [[baseball]], or [[Football games|football]] are regarded as possessing a lower level of ability than professional athletes. On the other hand, an amateur may be in a position to approach a subject with an open mind (as a result of the lack of formal training) and in a financially disinterested manner.  An amateur who dabbles in a field out of interest rather than as a profession, or possesses a general but superficial interest in any art or a branch of knowledge, is often referred to as a [[wiktionary:dilettante|dilettante]]. \n \n == Amateur athletics == \n {{main|Amateur sports}} \n The line between ''amateur'' and ''professional'' has always been blurred in athletics with the central idea being that amateurs should not receive material reward for taking part in sports. < ref > {{cite web|last1=Taonga|first1=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|title=Amateurism and professionalism \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/amateurism-and-professionalism/page-1|website=teara.govt.nz|access-date=May 15, 2018|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|title=What is amateurism?|url=https://www.ncaa.org/student-athletes/future/eligibility-center/what-amateurism|website=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|access-date=May 15, 2018|language=en|date=3 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180517085526/http://www.ncaa.org/student-athletes/future/eligibility-center/what-amateurism|archive-date=17 May 2018|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  The lack of financial benefit can be seen as a sign of [[Personal commitment|commitment]] to a sport; until the 1970s the Olympic rules required that competitors be amateurs.
