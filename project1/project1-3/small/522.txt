Natural-law anarcho-capitalism as advocated by [[Murray Rothbard]] holds that a universal system of rights can be derived from [[natural law]] (not to be confused with [[law of the jungle]]). Other anarcho-capitalists do not rely upon the idea of natural rights and present economic justifications for a [[free-market]] [[capitalist society]]. This latter approach has been offered by [[David D. Friedman]] in ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]''. < ref name= \" Tame, Chris R 1983. p. 56 \" > Tame, Chris R. (October 1983). ''The Chicago School: Lessons from the Thirties for the Eighties''. Economic Affairs. p. 56. < /ref >  Unlike other anarcho-capitalists, most notably Rothbard, Friedman has never tried to deny the theoretical cogency of the neoclassical literature on  \" [[market failure]] \" , but he openly applies the theory to both market and government institutions to compare the net result, nor has he been inclined to attack economic efficiency as a [[Normative economics|normative]] benchmark. < ref name= \" Friedman-1973 \"  / > \n \n John Kosanke sees such a debate as irrelevant. Kosanke believes that in the absence of statutory law the [[non-aggression principle]] is  \" naturally \"  enforced because individuals are automatically held accountable for their actions via [[tort]] and [[contract law]]. Kosanke also argues that communities of sovereign individuals naturally expel aggressors in the same way that ethical business practices are allegedly naturally required among competing businesses that are subject to what he describes as the  \" discipline of the marketplace \" . For Kosanke, the only thing that needs to be debated is the nature of the contractual mechanism that abolishes the state, or prevents it from coming into existence where new communities form. < ref name= \" libertarianpapers \"  / > \n \n According to [[Patrik Schumacher]], the political ideology and programme of Anarcho-capitalism envisages the radicalisation of the [[neoliberal]]  \" roll back of the state \" , and calls for the extension of  \" entrepreneurial freedom \"  and  \" competitive market rationality \"  to the point where the scope for private enterprise is all-encompassing and  \" leaves no space for state action whatsoever \" . < ref name= \" pschu \"  / > \n \n === On the state === \n Anarcho-capitalists opposition to the state is reflected in their goal of keeping but [[privatization|privatizing]] all functions of the state. < ref name= \" pschu \"  / > < ref name= \" Kinna 2012 \"  / > < ref > {{cite AV media |people=David Friedman|access-date=4 January 2021|date=27 November 2012|title=David Friedman on How to Privatize Everything|medium=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4CcannofnY|publisher=ReasonTV}} < /ref >  They see [[capitalism]] and the  \" [[free market]] \"  as the basis for a free and prosperous society.

So despite both belonging to the same class, they are non-producers of everything else) \n \n When a government decides to take money via taxes or establish any other form of control of someone else\u2019s property without any prior contract, they are non-producers taking over partial production from producers, and therefore would fit the definition of socialism, the only difference from government taxing and a complete dictatorship of the proletariat over all means of production is only the degree by which both are done, since both are the same in essence. < ref > {{Cite book|last=Hermman-Hoppe|first=Hans|title=a theory of socialism and capitalism|pages=60-62}} < /ref > \n \n Just like ice and water are the same in essence, only changing the degree of agitation of the water molecules, any little government control (like taxation or regulation) and a complete dictatorship are the same in essence, only changing the degree of socialism both decides to do. \n \n === Non-aggression principle === \n {{Main|Non-aggression principle}} \n Although anarcho-capitalists are against centralized states, most,not all, hold that all people would naturally share and agree to a specific moral theory. < ref name= \" swnauka \" > {{cite journal|url=http://nauka-pan.pl/index.php/nauka/article/view/747|author=Stanis\u0142aw W\u00f3jtowicz|title=Anarcho-capitalism, or can we do away with the state|journal=Nauka|issue=4|year=2017|issn=1231-8515|quote=The last problem is especially vexing, since anarcho-capitalists seem to be caught up in a contradiction here.

Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a [[universal ethic]], i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is [[self-ownership]] which he believes is both axiomatic and universal. < ref name= \" Rothbard-1982.2 \" > Rothbard, Murray (1982).

The difference between anarcho-capitalists and other libertarians is largely one of the degree to which they take this axiom. [[Minarchist]] libertarians such as [[libertarian political parties]] would retain the state in some smaller and less invasive form, retaining at the very least public police, courts and military. However, others might give further allowance for other government programs. In contrast, Rothbard rejects any level of  \" [[state intervention]] \" , defining the state as a [[coercive monopoly]] and as the only entity in human society that derives its income from what he refers to as  \" legal aggression \" , an entity that inherently violates the central axiom of libertarianism. < ref name= \" Rothbard-1982.2 \"  / > \n \n Some anarcho-capitalists such as Rothbard accept the non-aggression axiom on an intrinsic moral or natural law basis.

Based on their understanding and interpretation of anarchism, in order to forcefully prevent people from accumulating capital, which they believe is a goal of anarchists, there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to in essence exact a tax and re-allocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people.
