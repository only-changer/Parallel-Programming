[[Egyptian Museum]], Cairo.]] \n \n '''Alabaster''' is a [[mineral]] or rock that is soft, often used for carving, and is processed for [[plaster]] powder. Archaeologists and the stone processing industry use the word differently from [[geologist]]s. The former use it in a wider sense that includes varieties of two different minerals: the fine-grained massive type of [[gypsum]] < ref > [https://www.britannica.com/science/gypsum ''Gypsum'', Britannica, retrieved 8 January 2017] < /ref >  and the fine-grained banded type of [[calcite]]. < ref name= \" OxfMuseum \" > ''More about alabaster and travertine'', brief guide explaining the different use of these words by geologists, archaeologists, and those in the stone trade.

Modern alabaster is probably [[calcite]] but may be either. Both are easy to work and slightly soluble in water. They have been used for making a variety of indoor artwork and carving, and they will not survive long outdoors. \n \n The two kinds are readily distinguished by their different hardnesses: gypsum alabaster is so soft that a fingernail scratches it ([[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]] 1.5 to 2), while calcite cannot be scratched in this way (Mohs hardness 3), although it yields to a knife. Moreover, calcite alabaster, being a [[carbonate]], [[effervescence|effervesces]] when treated with [[hydrochloric acid]], while gypsum alabaster remains almost unaffected. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" > {{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Alabaster|volume=1|pages=466-467|first=Frederick William|last=Rudler}} Endnotes: \n * M.

It is found as either a [[stalagmite|stalagmitic]] deposit from the floor and walls of [[limestone]] [[cavern]]s, or as a kind of [[travertine]], similarly deposited in springs of calcareous water. Its deposition in successive layers gives rise to the banded appearance that the marble often shows on cross-section, from which its name is derived: onyx-marble or alabaster-onyx, or sometimes simply (and wrongly) as [[onyx]]. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / > \n \n ====Egypt and the Middle East==== \n Egyptian alabaster has been worked extensively near [[Suez]]{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and [[Assiut]]. < ref name= \" MatInd \" / > \n \n This stone variety is the  \" alabaster \"  of the [[ancient Egypt]]ians and [[Bible]] and is often termed ''Oriental alabaster'', since the early examples came from the [[Far East]]. The [[Greek language|Greek]] name ''alabastrites'' is said to be derived from the town of Alabastron in [[Egypt]], where the stone was quarried. The locality probably owed its name to the mineral;{{dubious|Circular argumentation...|date=July 2016}} the origin of the mineral name is obscure < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  (though see [[Alabaster#Etymology|above]]). \n \n The  \" Oriental \"  alabaster was highly esteemed for making small perfume bottles or ointment vases called [[alabastron|alabastra]]; the vessel name has been suggested as a possible source of the mineral name. In Egypt, craftsmen used alabaster for [[canopic jar]]s and various other sacred and sepulchral objects. A [[sarcophagus]] discovered in the tomb of [[Seti I]] near [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] is on display in [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], [[London]]; it is carved in a single block of translucent calcite alabaster from Alabastron. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / > \n \n [[Algeria]]n onyx-marble has been quarried largely in the province of [[Oran]]. \n \n ====North America==== \n In [[Mexico]], there are famous deposits of a delicate green variety at [[La Pedrara]], in the district of [[Tecali]], near [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]].

[[Tuscany|Tuscan]] alabaster occurs in nodular masses embedded in limestone, interstratified with [[marl]]s of [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] age. The mineral is worked largely by means of underground galleries, in the district of [[Volterra]]. Several varieties are recognized\u2014veined, spotted, clouded, agatiform, and others. The finest kind, obtained principally from [[Castellina Marittima|Castellina]], is sent to Florence for figure-sculpture, while the common kinds are carved locally, into vases, lights, and various ornamental objects.

It was also used for the effigies, often life size, on [[tomb monument]]s, as the typical recumbent position suited the material's lack of strength, and it was cheaper and easier to work than good marble. After the [[English Reformation]] the making of altarpiece sets was discontinued, but funerary monument work in reliefs and statues continued. \n \n Besides examples of these carvings still in Britain (especially at the [[Nottingham Castle Museum]], [[British Museum]], and [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]), trade in mineral alabaster (rather than just the antiques trade) has scattered examples in the material that may be found as far afield as the [[Mus\u00e9e de Cluny]], Spain, and Scandinavia. \n \n Alabaster also is found, although in smaller quantity, at [[Watchet]] in [[Somerset]], near [[Penarth]] in [[Glamorganshire]], and elsewhere. In [[Cumbria]] it occurs largely in the New Red rocks, but at a lower geological horizon. The alabaster of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire is found in thick nodular beds or  \" floors \"  in spheroidal masses known as  \" balls \"  or  \" bowls \"  and in smaller lenticular masses termed  \" cakes \" .
