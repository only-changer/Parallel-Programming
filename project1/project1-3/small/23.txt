It lies on [[Abadan Island]] ({{convert|68|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}} long, 3\u201319 & nbsp;km or 2\u201312 & nbsp;miles wide). The island is bounded in the west by the [[Shatt al-Arab|Arvand]] waterway and to the east by the [[Bahmanshir]] outlet of the [[Karun River]] (the [[Arvand Rood]]), {{convert|53|km|mi}} from the [[Persian Gulf]], < ref name= \" eb \" > {{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=6}} < /ref >  near the [[Iran\u2013Iraq]] border. Abadan is 140 & nbsp;km from the provincial capital city of [[Ahvaz]]. \n \n ==Etymology== \n The earliest mention of the island of Abadan, if not the port itself, is found in works of the geographer [[Marcian of Heraclea|Marcian]], who renders the name  \" Apphadana \" . < ref > {{harvnb|Hoeschel|Heracleensis|von Karyanda|Messenius|1600|p=48}} < /ref >  Earlier, the classical geographer [[Ptolemy]] notes  \" Apphana \"  as an island off the mouth of the [[Tigris]] (which is, where the modern Island of Abadan is located). An [[etymology]] for this name is presented by B. Farahvashi to be derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word  \" ab \"  (water) and the root  \" p\u0101 \"  (guard, watch) thus  \" coastguard station \" ). < ref name= \" ei \"  / > \n \n In Islamic times, a pseudo-etymology was produced by the historian [[Ahmad ibn Yahya al-Baladhuri]] (d. 892) quoting a folk story that the town was presumably founded by one  \" Abbad bin Hosayn \"  from the Arabian Tribe of [[Banu Tamim]], who established a garrison there during the governorship of ''Hajjaj'' in the [[Ummayad]] period. < ref name= \" ei \" / > \n \n In the subsequent centuries, the Persian version of the name had begun to come into general use before it was adopted by official decree in 1935. < ref name= \" ei \" > {{harvnb|Elwell-Sutton|de Planhol|1982|p=52}} < /ref > \n \n ==Population== \n \n {| class= \" wikitable \" \n |+ Population \n !

The 1986 census recorded only 6 people. In 1991, 84,774 had returned to live in the city. < ref name=col / >  By 2001, the population had jumped to 206,073, and it was 217,988, in 48,061 families, according to 2006 census.{{sfn|Vadahti|2006}} [[Abadan Refinery]] is one of the largest in the world. The population today has reached almost 350,000 people. \n \n Only 9% of managers (of the oil company) were from Khuzestan. The proportion of natives of [[Tehran]], the [[Caspians|Caspian]], [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]], and [[Kurdistan Province, Iran|Kurdistan]] rose from 4% of [[blue collar]] workers to 22% of [[White-collar worker|white collar]] workers to 45% of managers, thus Arabic-speakers were concentrated on the lower rungs of the work force, managers tended to be brought in from some distance. < ref > {{harvnb|Elwell-Sutton|de Planhol|1982|pp=55\u201356}} < /ref >  There is also a single Armenian church in the centre of the city. \n \n ==History== \n Abadan is thought to have been further developed into a major port city under the [[Abbasid]]s' rule. The city was then a commercial source of salt and woven [[mat]]s. < ref name= \" eb \"  / >  The [[siltation]] of the river delta forced the town further away from water; In the 14th century, however, [[Ibn Battutah]] described Abadan just as a small port in a flat salty plain. < ref name= \" eb2 \" > {{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=7}} < /ref >  Politically, Abadan was often the subject of dispute between the nearby states. In 1847, Persia acquired it from the [[Ottoman Empire]] < ref name=col / >  in which state Abadan has remained since. From the 17th century onward, the island of Abadan was part of the lands of the [[Arab]] ''Ka'ab'' ([[Bani Kaab]]) tribe. One section of the tribe, ''Mohaysen'', had its headquarters at ''Mohammara'' (now [[Khorramshahr]]), until the removal of Shaikh [[Khaz'al Khan]] in 1924. < ref > {{harvnb|Elwell-Sutton|de Planhol|1982|p=53}} < /ref > \n [[File:Exploded tank, remains in Abadan as symbol of Iran\u2013Iraq War.jpg|thumb|Exploded [[T-54/55]] tank, remains as symbol of [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].|alt=]] \n [[File:Abadan ruin.jpg|thumb|Ruins of a building in Abadan, which had suffered serious damages during the Iran\u2013Iraq War (1980\u201388), including by Saddam's deadly chemical weapons.]] \n \n It was not until the 20th century that rich oil fields were discovered in the area. On 16 July 1909, after secret negotiation with the British consul, [[Percy Cox]], assisted by [[Arnold Wilson]], and [[Khaz'al al-Ka'bi|Sheik Khaz'al]] agreed to a rental agreement for the island, including Abadan. < ref > {{harvnb|Ferrier|1991|pp=641\u201342}} < /ref > < ref name=gre > {{harvnb|Greaves|1991|pp=418\u201319}} < /ref > < ref name=AB56 > {{harvnb|Abrahamian|2008|p=56}} < /ref > {{refn|group=nb|The agreement gave \u00a31,500 per year and \u00a316,500 in gold sovereigns to the Sheik. < ref name=AB56/ > }} The Sheik continued to administer the island until 1924. < ref name=fer > {{harvnb|Ferrier|1991|pp=647\u201348}} < /ref >  The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] built their first pipeline terminus [[oil refinery]] in Abadan, starting in 1909 and completing it in 1912, with oil flowing by August 1912 (see [[Abadan Refinery]]). < ref name=mac > {{harvnb|MacPherson|1989|p=164}} < /ref > < ref > {{harvnb|Issawi|1991|pp=606\u201307}} < /ref >  Refinery throughput numbers rose from 33,000 tons in 1912\u20131913 to 4,338,000 tons in 1931. < ref name=fer/ >  By 1938, it was the largest in the world. \n \n During [[World War II]], Abadan was the site of brief combat between Iranian forces and British and Indian troops during the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]]. Later, Abadan was a major logistics centre for [[Lend-Lease]] aircraft being sent to the [[Soviet Union]] by the United States. < ref > {{harvnb|Ferrier|1991|p=651}} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web | date = 3 April 1987 | url = http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/190/278.xml | title = Document Detail for IRISNUM= 00190278 | access-date = 6 August 2014 | website = Air Force History Index }} < /ref > \n \n In 1951, Iran nationalised all oil properties and refining ground to a stop on the island.

On 19 August 1978, the anniversary of the US-backed coup d'\u00e9tat that had overthrown the nationalist and popular Iranian prime minister, [[Mohammed Mossadegh]], the Cinema Rex, a movie theatre in Abadan, was set ablaze. The [[Cinema Rex Fire]] caused 430 deaths, < ref name = Cam > {{harvnb|Chelkowski|1991|p=800}} < /ref > {{refn|group=nb|Sources give different amounts for the number of people killed, with 400+, < ref name=abra > {{harvnb|Abrahamian|2008|p=159}} < /ref >   \" about 370 people \" , < ref name=ax > {{harvnb|Axworthy|2013|pp=108\u201309}} < /ref >  and  \" almost 400 people. \" < ref name=dan > {{harvnb|Daniel|2001|pp=167\u201368}} < /ref > }} but more importantly, it was another event that kept the Islamic Revolution moving ahead. At the time, there was much confusion and misinformation about the perpetrators of the incident. The public largely put the blame on the local police chief and also the Shah and [[SAVAK]]. < ref name=abra/ > < ref name=ax/ > < ref name=dan/ > < ref > {{harvnb|Satrapi|2003|pp=14\u201315}} < /ref >  The reformist ''Sobhe Emrooz'' newspaper in one of its editorials revealed that the Cinema Rex was burned down by radical Islamists. The newspaper was shut down immediately after. Over time, the true culprits, radical Islamists, were apprehended, and the logic behind this act was revealed, as they were trying both to foment the general public to distrust the government even more, and they also perceived cinema as a link to the Americans. < ref name=ax/ > < ref > {{harvnb|Keddie|2003|p=231}} < /ref >  The fire was one of four during a short period in August, with other fires in [[Mashhad]], [[Urmia|Rizaiya]], and [[Shiraz]]. < ref name=Cam/ > \n In September 1980, Abadan was almost overrun during a surprise attack on Khuzestan by Iraq, marking the beginning of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. For 12 months, Abadan was besieged, but never captured, by Iraqi forces, and in September 1981, the Iranians broke the siege of Abadan. < ref > {{harvnb|Daniel|2001|p=208}} < /ref >  Much of the city, including the oil refinery, which was the world's largest refinery with capacity of 628,000 barrels per day, was badly damaged or destroyed by the siege and by bombing. < ref > {{harvnb|MacPherson|1989|p=154}} < /ref >  Prior to the war, the city's civilian population was about 300,000, but at the war's end nearly the entire populace had sought refuge elsewhere in Iran. \n \n After the war, the biggest concern was the rebuilding of Abadan's oil refinery, as it was operating at 10% of capacity due to damage. < ref > {{harvnb|Axworthy|2013|p=309}} < /ref >  In 1993, the refinery began limited operation and the port reopened.  By 1997, the refinery reached the same rate of production as before the war.  Recently, Abadan has been the site of major labour activity as workers at the oil refineries in the city have staged walkouts and strikes to protest non-payment of wages and the political situation in the country. < ref > {{harvnb|Mather|2009}} < /ref > \n \n === First of Iran === \n * The first photography association in the Middle East < ref > [https://rasekhoon.net/news/show/1155202/%D9%86%D8%AE%D8%B3%D8%AA%DB%8C%D9%86-%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A2%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86 Iran's first in Abadan] < /ref > \n * The first refinery in the Middle East < ref > [http://www.petromuseum.ir/content/19/%D8%A2%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D9%86%D9%81%D8%AA-%D8%A2%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%86%D8%AF/211/%D9%86%D8%AE%D8%B3%D8%AA%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%DA%A9%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%B1-%D9%88-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A2%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86 The first computer and refinery in the Middle East] < /ref > \n * Iran first petrochemical plant < ref > [http://abadan.irib.ir/-/%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%8C%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%86-%D9%87%D8%A7 Abadan, the city of the first] < /ref > < ref > Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia < /ref > < ref > Architecture and Globalisation in the Persian Gulf Region \n < /ref > \n * Iran first public relations < ref > [https://www.rasmuselling.com/abadan/ When Iran\u2019s Abadan was Capital of the World | Abadan, Civilization  &  Modernity] < /ref > \n * The first trolley in Iran \n * The first traffic department in Iran \n * The first radio and television station after Tehran < ref name= \" ReferenceA \" > Book of History of Television and Radio in Iran, Page 23 < /ref > \n * The first filling station in Iran < ref > [https://www.asriran.com/fa/news/266353/%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%86-%D9%BE%D9%85%D9%BE-%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%B2%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A2%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B9%DA%A9%D8%B3 1927 / The first filling station in Iran] < /ref > \n * The first kindergarten in Iran \n * The first technical and vocational school center in Iran < ref name= \" ReferenceA \" / > \n * Iran first non-profit school \n * Iran first official football team < ref > [https://www.espn.com/soccer/club/name/469/blog/post/1884328/headline 13 things you might not know about Iran - ESPN.com] < /ref > \n * The first motorcycle track, car ride, squash in Iran \n * The first bicycle and motorcycle parking in Iran \n * The first pizza shop in Iran < ref > Cheat Sheet on Iranian Restaurants and Street Food < /ref > \n \n ==Recent events== \n To honor the 100th anniversary of the refining of oil in Abadan, city officials are planning an oil museum. < ref name= \" chn.ir \" > {{cite web | website = Petro Energy Information Network | date = 22 October 2005 | url = http://www.shana.ir/en/newsagency/68942 | title = Southern Iran Craves for an Oil Museum | access-date = 6 August 2014 }} < /ref >  The Abadan oil refinery was featured on the reverse side of Iran's 100-rial banknotes printed in 1965 and from 1971 to 1973.
