Then, Steve Jobs suggested that they design and sell a single etched and silkscreened circuit board & mdash;just the bare board, with no electronic parts & mdash;that people could use to build the computers. Wozniak calculated that having the board design laid out would cost $1,000 and manufacturing would cost another $20 per board; he hoped to recoup his costs if 50 people bought the boards for $40 each. To fund this small venture & mdash;their first company & mdash;Jobs sold his van and Wozniak sold his [[HP-65]] calculator.

Several boards have been found with numbered stickers affixed to them, which appear to be inspection stickers from the PCB manufacturer/assembler. A batch of boards is known to have numbers hand-written in black permanent marker on the back; these usually appear as  \" 01-00## \"  and anecdotal evidence suggests they are inventory control numbers added by the Byte Shop to the batch Apple sold them. These Byte Shop numbers have often erroneously been described as serial numbers by auction houses and in related press coverage. < ref > {{cite web|title=The Apple 1 Registry|url=http://www.willegal.net/appleii/apple1-originals.htm|access-date=June 26, 2013}} < /ref > \n \n ==Museums displaying an original Apple 1 Computer== \n ===United States=== \n * [[American Computer  &  Robotics Museum]] in Bozeman, Montana \n * [[Computer History Museum]] in Mountain View, California \n * [[Computer Museum of America]] in Roswell, Georgia \n * [[Pavek Museum of Broadcasting]] in St. Louis Park, Minnesota \n * [[Smithsonian Museum of American History]] in Washington, DC \n * [[Living Computers: Museum + Labs]] in Seattle, Washington \n *[https://museum.syssrc.com System Source Computer Museum] in Hunt Valley, Maryland \n \n ===Australia=== \n * [[Powerhouse Museum]] in Sydney, New South Wales \n \n ===United Kingdom=== \n * [[Science Museum, London]] in London, United Kingdom \n \n ===South Korea=== \n * [[Nexon Computer Museum]] in Jeju Island, South Korea \n \n ===Switzerland=== \n *[https://enter.ch/sammlung/highlights/ ENTER Computer Museum] in Solothurn, Switzerland \n \n ==Clones and replicas== \n Several Apple I clones and replicas have been released in recent years.
