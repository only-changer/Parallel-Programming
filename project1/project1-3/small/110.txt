Today, Adelaide is noted for [[:Category:Festivals in Adelaide|its many festivals]] and sporting events, its [[South Australian wine|food and wine]], its coastline and hills, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors.

The rural area surrounding Adelaide was surveyed by Light in preparation to sell a total of over {{convert|405|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land. Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Tasmania]]. Wool production provided an early basis for the South Australian economy. By 1860, wheat farms had been established from [[Encounter Bay]] in the south to [[Clare, South Australia|Clare]] in the north. \n [[File:Karte Adelaide MKL1888.png|thumb|left|upright|1888 map of Adelaide, showing the gradual development of its urban layout]] \n [[George Gawler]] took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and, despite being under orders from the ''Select Committee on South Australia'' in Britain not to undertake any public works, promptly oversaw construction of a governor's house, the [[Adelaide Gaol]], police barracks, a hospital, a [[Customs House Port Adelaide|customs house]] and a wharf at [[Port Adelaide]]. Gawler was recalled and replaced by [[George Edward Grey]] in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: silver was discovered in [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]] that year, agriculture was well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned. \n \n Trade links with the rest of the Australian states were established after the [[Murray River]] was successfully navigated in 1853 by [[Francis Cadell (explorer)|Francis Cadell]], an Adelaide resident. South Australia became a [[self-governing colony]] in 1856 with the ratification of a new constitution by the British parliament.

In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed.

The plan involved the construction of freeways, [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system.

In 1980, the [[Liberal party of Australia|Liberal party]] won government and premier [[David Tonkin]] committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan, ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical.

[[South Australian state elections|General elections]] are held every four years, the last being the [[2018 South Australian state election|2018 election]]. As Adelaide is South Australia's capital and most populous city, the [[Government of South Australia|State Government]] co-operates extensively with the [[City of Adelaide]]. In 2006, the Ministry for the City of Adelaide was created to facilitate the State Government's collaboration with the [[Adelaide City Council]] and the Lord Mayor to improve Adelaide's image. The State Parliament's Capital City Committee is also involved in the governance of the City of Adelaide, being primarily concerned with the planning of Adelaide's urban development and growth. < ref > [https://capcity.adelaide.sa.gov.au/ Capital City Committee] Retrieved 29 September 2020. < /ref > \n \n Reflecting South Australia's status as Australia's most centralised state, Adelaide elects a substantial majority of the South Australian House of Assembly.

Adelaide's water is supplied from its seven reservoirs: [[Mount Bold Reservoir|Mount Bold]], [[Happy Valley Reservoir|Happy Valley]], [[Myponga Reservoir|Myponga]], [[Millbrook Reservoir|Millbrook]], [[Hope Valley Reservoir|Hope Valley]], [[Little Para Reservoir|Little Para]] and [[South Para Reservoir|South Para]]. The yield from these reservoir catchments can be as little as 10% of the city's requirements (90GL per annum < ref name=desal / > ) in drought years and about 60% in average years. The remaining demand is met by the pumping of water from the [[River Murray]]. < ref name=desal / > \n \n A [[Adelaide Desalination Plant|sea-water desalination plant]] capable of supplying 100GL per annum was built during the 2001\u20132009 drought; however, it operated at about 8% of its capacity until 2019. In December 2018, the State and Federal Governments agreed to fund a $2m study to determine how the plant could be used to reduce reliance on river water, in an effort to help save the Murray River basin and mouth (including the [[Coorong]]) from further ecological damage. < ref name =desal > {{cite news|website=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-14/adelaide-desal-plant-revival-plan-to-ease-use-of-murray-water/10619960|first1=Marty|last1=McCarthy|first2=Matt|last2=Coleman|date=14 December 2018|title=Plan to revive Adelaide's desalination plant to help Murray River|access-date=12 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730175120/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-14/adelaide-desal-plant-revival-plan-to-ease-use-of-murray-water/10619960|archive-date=30 July 2019|url-status=live}} < /ref > \n \n ===Communications=== \n AdelaideFree WiFi is a citywide free [[WiFi]] network covering most of the inner city areas of Adelaide, primarily the [[Adelaide city centre|Adelaide CBD]] and Northern Adelaide precincts. < ref name= \" inone \" > {{Cite web|url=https://hotspot.internode.on.net/partners/adelaidefree/|title=Internode :: Products :: WiFi Hotspots :: Partners :: AdelaideFree|last=Internode|website=hotspot.internode.on.net|access-date=23 December 2016|archive-date=25 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125093422/https://hotspot.internode.on.net/partners/adelaidefree/|url-status=dead}} < /ref >  It was officially launched at the Adelaide Central Markets on Tuesday 25 June 2014. < ref name= \" inone \" / > < ref > {{cite web \n |url=https://www.cityofadelaide.com.au/newsroom/adelaide-connects-up-to-large-scale-fast-free-wi-fi/ \n |title=Adelaide connects up to large-scale fast, free WiFi \n |publisher=City of Adelaide \n |author=Rebecca Draysey \n |date=25 June 2014 \n |access-date=16 March 2020 \n }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite web \n |url=https://dpti.sa.gov.au/newconnections/news?a=141907 \n |title=200 new Wi-Fi locations across city \n |publisher=Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure, Government of South Australia \n |date=25 June 2014 \n |access-date=16 March 2020 \n }} < /ref >  It is provided by [[Internode (ISP)|Internode]], < ref > {{Cite web | url=http://www.internode.on.net/news/2014/06/339.php | title=Internode :: About :: News and Media :: Internode Wi-Fi sets Adelaide free}} < /ref >  with infrastructure provided by outdoor [[Cisco]] WiFi N access points attached to the top of lighting poles, as well as inside cafes and businesses across the city. \n \n == See also == \n {{Portal|South Australia}} \n < !-- Alphabetic order -- > \n * [[Adelaide city centre]] includes chart of major streets and squares, street widths, and town acres \n * [[Adelaide Hills]] \n * [[City of Adelaide]] \n * [[Music of Adelaide]] \n * [[Port Adelaide]] \n \n ;
