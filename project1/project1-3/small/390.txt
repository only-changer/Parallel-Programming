In the system of [[Greek numerals]], it has a value of 1. \n \n It is derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] letter [[Aleph#Origin|aleph]] [[Image:phoenician aleph.svg|20px|Aleph]] - an [[ox]]. < ref > [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iwWuY9tAVq8C Chambers concise dictionary] p.30 Allied Publishers, 2004 {{ISBN|9798186062363}} Retrieved 2017-02-06 < /ref > \n \n Letters that arose from alpha include the [[Latin script|Latin]] [[A]] and the [[Cyrillic]] letter [[A (Cyrillic)|\u0410]]. \n \n In English, the noun  \" alpha \"  is used as a synonym for  \" beginning \" , or  \" first \"  (in a series), reflecting its Greek roots. < ref > [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alpha Alpha - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary < !-- Bot generated title -- > ] < /ref > \n \n ==Uses== \n \n ===Greek=== \n In [[Ancient Greek]], alpha was pronounced {{IPAblink|\u00e4|a}} and could be either [[phoneme|phonemically]] long ([a\u02d0]) or short ([a]).

It can also combine with the [[iota subscript]] ({{lang|grc|\u1fb3}}). \n \n ====Greek grammar==== \n In the [[Attic Greek|Attic]]\u2013[[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] dialect of Ancient Greek, long alpha {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}} fronted to {{IPAblink|\u025b\u02d0}} ([[eta]]). In Ionic, the shift took place in all positions. In Attic, the shift did not take place after [[epsilon]], [[iota]], and [[rho]] (\u03b5, \u03b9, \u03c1; ''e'', ''i'', ''r''). In [[Doric Greek|Doric]] and [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]], long alpha is preserved in all positions. < ref > [[Herbert Weir Smyth]]. ''Greek grammar for colleges''.

Alpha also stands for [[thermal expansion coefficient]] of a [[Chemical compound|compound]] in [[physical chemistry]]. It is also commonly used in [[mathematics]] in [[algebra|algebraic solutions]] representing quantities such as angles. Furthermore, in mathematics, the letter alpha is used to denote the area underneath a [[Normal distribution|normal curve]] in [[statistics]] to denote [[statistical significance|significance level]] < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.une.edu.au/WebStat/unit_materials/c5_inferential_statistics/what_alpha_level.html |work=Research Methods and Statistics PESS202 Lecture and Commentary Notes |title=Chapter 5: Analysing the Data Part II : Inferential Statistics |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822143239/http://www.une.edu.au/WebStat/unit_materials/c5_inferential_statistics/what_alpha_level.html |archive-date=22 August 2011 }} < /ref >  when proving [[null hypotheses|null]] and [[Alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]]. In ethology, it is used to name the [[Alpha (ethology)|dominant individual]] in a group of animals. In aerodynamics, the letter is used as a symbol for the [[angle of attack]] of an aircraft and the word  \" alpha \"  is used as a synonym for this property. \n \n The proportionality operator  \" [[\u221d]] \"  (in [[Unicode]]: U+221D) is sometimes mistaken for alpha. \n \n The uppercase letter alpha is not generally used as a symbol because it tends to be rendered identically to the uppercase [[A|Latin A]]. \n \n ===International Phonetic Alphabet=== \n In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], the letter \u0251, which looks similar to the lower-case alpha, represents the [[open back unrounded vowel]]. \n \n ==History and symbolism== \n {{see|History of the Greek alphabet}} \n \n ===Origin=== \n The [[Phoenician alphabet]] was adopted for Greek in  the early 8th century BC, perhaps in [[Euboea]]. < ref > The date of the earliest inscribed objects; A.W. Johnston,  \" The alphabet \" , in N. Stampolidis and V. Karageorghis, eds, ''Sea Routes from Sidon to Huelva: Interconnections in the Mediterranean'' 2003:263-76, summarizes the present scholarship on the dating. < /ref >   \n The majority of the letters of the Phoenician alphabet were adopted into Greek with much the same sounds as they had had in Phoenician, but ''[[Aleph (letter)|\u02bc\u0101leph]]'', the Phoenician letter representing the glottal stop {{IPA|[\u0294]}}, \n was adopted as representing the vowel {{IPA|[a]}}; similarly,   ''[[He (letter)|h\u0113]]'' {{IPA|[h]}}  and ''[[Ayin|\u02bdayin]]'' {{IPA|[\u0295]}} are Phoenician consonants that became Greek vowels,  [[epsilon]] {{IPA|[e]}} and [[omicron]] {{IPA|[o]}}, respectively. \n \n ===Plutarch=== \n [[Plutarch]], in ''[[Moralia]]'', < ref > Symposiacs, Book IX, questions II  &  III [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/symposiacs/chapter9.html#section91 On-line text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013230602/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/symposiacs/chapter9.html#section91 |date=13 October 2008 }} at Adelaide library < /ref >  presents a discussion on why the letter alpha stands first in the alphabet. Ammonius asks Plutarch what he, being a [[Boeotia]]n, has to say for [[Cadmus]], the [[Phoenicia]]n who reputedly settled in [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and introduced the alphabet to Greece, placing ''alpha'' first because it is the Phoenician name for [[ox]]\u2014which, unlike [[Hesiod]], < ref > Hesiod, in ''[[Works and Days]]'' (see on [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0132:card=405 Perseus Project]), advises the early Greek farmers,  \" First of all, get a house, then a woman and third, an ox for the plough. \" < /ref >  the Phoenicians considered not the second or third, but the first of all necessities.  \" Nothing at all, \"  Plutarch replied. He then added that he would rather be assisted by [[Lamprias]], his own grandfather, than by [[Dionysus]]' grandfather, i.e. Cadmus. For Lamprias had said that the first articulate sound made is  \" alpha \" , because it is very plain and simple\u2014the air coming off the mouth does not require any motion of the tongue\u2014and therefore this is the first sound that children make. \n \n According to Plutarch's natural order of attribution of the [[vowel]]s to the [[planet]]s, alpha was connected with the [[Moon]]. \n \n ===Alpha and Omega=== \n [[Image:Memorial Stained Glass, Yeo Hall, Chapel, Royal Military College of Canada 605 Oliver Tiffany  &  203 Williiam Bermingham.jpg|right|thumb|Memorial Stained Glass window, [[Royal Military College of Canada]] features [[Alpha and Omega]]]] \n {{main|Alpha and Omega}} \n \n As the first letter of the alphabet, Alpha as a [[Greek numeral]] came to represent the number [[1 (number)|1]]. \n Therefore, Alpha, both as a symbol and term, is used to refer to the  \" first \" , or  \" primary \" , or  \" principal \"  (most significant) occurrence or status of a thing. \n   \n The New Testament has God declaring himself to be the  \" [[Alpha and Omega]], the beginning and the end, the first and the last. \"  ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 22:13, KJV, and see also 1:8). \n \n {{further|Alpha (ethology)}} \n Consequently, the term  \" alpha \"  has also come to be used to denote  \" primary \"  position in social hierarchy, examples being  \" [[alpha male]]s \"  or pack leaders. \n \n ==Computer encodings== \n * Greek alpha / Coptic alfa < ref > {{cite web|title=Character Encodings|url=http://www.kreativekorp.com/charset/|access-date=14 January 2013}} < /ref > \n \n {{charmap \n |0391|name1=Greek Capital Letter Alpha \n |03B1|name2=Greek Small Letter Alpha \n |2C80|name3=Coptic Capital Letter Alfa \n |2C81|name4=Coptic Small Letter Alfa \n |map1=[[CP 437]]|map1char2=E0 \n |map2=DOS Greek|map2char1=80|map2char2=98 \n |map3=DOS Greek-2|map3char1=A4|map3char2=D6 \n |map4=Windows 1253|map4char1=C1|map4char2=E1 \n |namedref1=TeX|ref1char2=\\alpha \n }} \n \n For accented Greek characters, see [[Greek diacritics#Computer encoding|Greek diacritics: Computer encoding]]. \n \n * Latin / [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] alpha \n \n {{charmap \n |0251|name1=Latin Small Letter Alpha \n |0252|name2=Latin Small Letter Turned Alpha \n |1D90|name3=Latin Small Letter Alpha < br / > with Retroflex Hook \n |1D45|name4=Modifier Letter < br / > Small Alpha \n |1D9B|name5=Modifier Letter < br / > Small Turned Alpha \n }} \n \n * Mathematical / Technical alpha \n \n {{charmap \n |237A|name1=APL Functional Symbol Alpha \n |2376|name2=APL Functional Symbol < br / > Alpha Underbar \n |1D6A8|name3=Mathematical Bold < br / > Capital Alpha \n |1D6C2|name4=Mathematical Bold < br / > Small Alpha \n |1D6E2|name5=Mathematical Italic < br / > Capital Alpha \n |1D6FC|name6=Mathematical Italic < br / > Small Alpha \n }} \n \n {{charmap \n |1D71C|name1=Mathematical Bold Italic < br / > Capital Alpha \n |1D736|name2=Mathematical Bold Italic < br / > Small Alpha \n |1D756|name3=Mathematical Sans-Serif < br / > Bold Capital Alpha \n |1D770|name4=Mathematical Sans-Serif < br / > Bold Small Alpha \n |1D790|name5=Mathematical Sans-Serif < br / > Bold Italic Capital Alpha \n |1D7AA|name6=Mathematical Sans-Serif < br / > Bold Italic Small Alpha \n }} \n \n ==References== \n {{Wiktionary|\u0391|\u03b1}} \n {{EBD poster|A (letter)}} \n {{reflist}} \n \n [[Category:Greek letters]] \n [[Category:Vowel letters]]"
