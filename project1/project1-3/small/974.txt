In larger cities and towns such as [[Yerevan]], [[Gyumri]], [[Vanadzor]] and [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]], bus stations are equipped with a waiting room and a ticket office, in other towns bus stations may not have shelters. Most of the routes are operated by [[GAZelle]] minivans with a capacity of 15 passengers, some routes are operated by soviet bus producer [[LiAZ (Russia)]]. Yerevan itself has a large integrated bus network, with a newly acquired bus fleet, passengers are able to connect from one end of the city to the other. [[Wi-fi]] is available on most city buses. < ref name= \" auto \" / >  Despite this, buses often have difficulty meeting the demand for capacity, mainly in Yerevan, where vehicles are typically overcrowded. There are no night services between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. There is no ticket system in the country, passengers pay in cash to drivers.  Passengers on the national bus network pay before boarding, passengers on the Yerevan bus network pay after the ride, while leaving the vehicle.

The  \" North-South Road Corridor Investment Program \"  is a major infrastructure project which aims at connecting the southern border of Armenia with its northern by means of a 556 & nbsp;km-long Meghri-Yerevan-Bavra highway. It is a major US$1.5 billion infrastructure project funded by the [[Asian Development Bank]], [[European Investment Bank]] and the [[Eurasian Development Bank]]. When completed, the highway will provide access to European countries via the [[Black Sea]]. It could also eventually interconnect the Black Sea ports of Georgia with the major ports of Iran, thus positioning Armenia in a strategic transport corridor between Europe and Asia. < ref name= \" auto2 \" / > < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://northsouth.am/en|title=Home  & #124; North-South Road Program State Non-Commercial Organization|website=northsouth.am}} < /ref >  Armenia is pursuing further loans from [[China]] as part of the [[Belt and Road Initiative]] to complete the north\u2013south highway. < ref name= \" auto3 \" / > \n \n Armenia connects to European road networks via the [[International E-road network]] through various routes such as; [[European route E117]], [[European route E691]], [[European route E001]] and [[European route E60]].
