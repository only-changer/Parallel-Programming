[[Othniel Charles Marsh]] described and named the first-known species, '''''A. ajax''''', in 1877, and a second species, '''''A. louisae''''', was discovered and named by William H. Holland in 1916. ''Apatosaurus'' lived about 152 to 151 million years ago (mya), during the late [[Kimmeridgian]] to early [[Tithonian]] age, and are now known from [[fossil]]s in the [[Morrison Formation]] of modern-day [[Colorado]], [[Oklahoma]], [[New Mexico]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Utah]] in the United States. ''Apatosaurus'' had an average length of {{convert|21|-|22.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and an average mass of {{convert|16.4|-|22.4|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}. A few specimens indicate a maximum length of 11\u201330% greater than average and a mass of {{convert|32.7|-|72.6|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}. \n \n The [[cervical vertebrae]] of ''Apatosaurus'' are less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of ''[[Diplodocus]]'', a [[diplodocid]] like ''Apatosaurus'', and the bones of the leg are much stockier despite being longer, implying that ''Apatosaurus'' was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. ''Apatosaurus'' had a single [[claw]] on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb. The ''Apatosaurus'' skull, long thought to be similar to ''[[Camarasaurus]]'', is much more similar to that of ''Diplodocus''. ''Apatosaurus'' was a generalized [[browsing (herbivory)|browser]] that likely held its head elevated. To lighten its vertebrae, ''Apatosaurus'' had [[air sacs]] that made the bones internally full of holes. Like that of other diplodocids, its tail may have been used as a whip to create loud noises. \n \n The skull of ''Apatosaurus'' was confused with that of ''Camarasaurus'' and ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' until 1909, when the [[holotype]] of ''A. louisae'' was found, and a complete skull just a few meters away from the front of the neck. [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] disagreed with this association, and went on to mount a skeleton of ''Apatosaurus'' with a ''Camarasaurus'' skull cast. ''Apatosaurus'' skeletons were mounted with speculative skull casts until 1970, when McIntosh showed that more robust skulls assigned to ''Diplodocus'' were more likely from ''Apatosaurus''. \n \n ''Apatosaurus'' is a genus in the family Diplodocidae. It is one of the more [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] genera, with only ''[[Amphicoelias]]'' and possibly a new, unnamed genus more primitive. Although the subfamily [[Apatosaurinae]] was named in 1929, the group was not used [[valid name (zoology)|validly]] until an extensive 2015 study. Only ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' is also in the subfamily, with the other genera being considered synonyms or reclassified as [[diplodocinae|diplodocines]]. ''Brontosaurus'' has long been considered a [[junior synonym]] of ''Apatosaurus''; its type species was reclassified as ''A.{{nbsp}}excelsus'' in 1903. A 2015 study concluded that ''Brontosaurus'' is a valid genus of sauropod distinct from ''Apatosaurus'', but not all paleontologists agree with this division. As it existed in North America during the late Jurassic, ''Apatosaurus'' would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as ''[[Allosaurus]]'', ''Camarasaurus'', ''Diplodocus'', and ''[[Stegosaurus]]''. \n \n ==Description== \n [[File:Apatosaurus scale mmartyniuk wiki.png|thumb|left|Comparison of ''A. ajax'' (orange) and ''A.{{nbsp}}louisae'' (red) with a human (blue) and ''[[Brontosaurus parvus]]'' (green)]] \n ''Apatosaurus'' was a large, long-necked, [[quadruped]]al animal with a long, whip-like tail. Its [[forelimb]]s were slightly shorter than its [[hindlimb]]s. Most size estimates are based on specimen [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History|CM]]{{nbsp}}3018, the [[type (biology)|type specimen]] of ''A.{{nbsp}}louisae''. In 1936 this was measured to be {{convert|21.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}, by measuring the [[vertebral column]]. < ref name= \" gilmore36 \" / >  Current estimates are similar, finding that the individual was {{convert|21|-|22.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and had a mass of {{convert|16.4|-|22.4|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}. < ref name=Seebacher01/ > < ref name= \" mazzettaetal2004 \" / > < ref name=henderson/ >  A 2015 study that estimated the mass of volumetric models of ''[[Dreadnoughtus]]'', ''Apatosaurus'', and ''[[Giraffatitan]]'' estimates CM{{nbsp}}3018 at {{convert|21.8|-|38.2|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}, similar in mass to ''Dreadnoughtus''. < ref name= \" bates & falkingham2015 \" / >  Past estimates have put the creature's mass as high as {{convert|35.0|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}. < ref name=Seebacher01/ >  Some specimens of ''A.{{nbsp}}ajax'' (such as [[Oklahoma Museum of Natural History|OMNH]]{{nbsp}}1670) represent individuals 11{{ndash}}30% longer, suggesting masses twice that of CM{{nbsp}}3018 or {{convert|32.7|-|72.6|t|LT ST|abbr=on}}, potentially rivaling the largest [[titanosaur]]s. < ref name= \" wedel2013 \" / > \n [[File:Apatosaurus ajax skull.jpg|thumb|''A. ajax'' skull, specimen CMC VP 7180]] \n \n The skull is small in relation to the size of the animal. The jaws are lined with spatulate (chisel-like) teeth suited to an [[herbivore|herbivorous]] diet. < ref name= \" fastovsky \" / >  The snout of ''Apatosaurus'' and similar [[diplodocoidea|diplodocoids]] is squared, with only ''[[Nigersaurus]]'' having a squarer skull. < ref name= \" whitlock11 \" / >  The braincase of ''Apatosaurus'' is well preserved in specimen BYU{{nbsp}}17096, which also preserved much of the skeleton. A phylogenetic analysis found that the braincase had a morphology similar to those of other diplodocoids. < ref name= \" balanoff2010 \" / >  Some skulls of ''Apatosaurus'' have been found still in articulation with their teeth. Those teeth that have the [[tooth enamel|enamel]] surface exposed do not show any scratches on the surface; instead, they display a sugary texture and little wear. < ref name= \" whitlock11 \" / > \n [[File:Apatosaurus ajax holotype cervical.png|thumb|left|Cervical vertebra of ''A. ajax'' (holotype, [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|YPM]] 1860) in side and anterior view]] \n Like those of other sauropods, the neck vertebrae are deeply bifurcated; they carried neural spines with a large trough in the middle, resulting in a wide, deep neck. < ref name= \" fastovsky \" / >  The vertebral formula for the holotype of ''A.{{nbsp}}louisae'' is 15{{nbsp}}cervicals, 10{{nbsp}}[[thoracic vertebrae|dorsals]], 5{{nbsp}}[[Sacrum#Other animals|sacrals]], and 82{{nbsp}}[[Vertebra#Other animals|caudals]]. The caudal vertebra number may vary, even within species. < ref name= \" gilmore36 \" / >  The cervical vertebrae of ''Apatosaurus'' and ''Brontosaurus'' are stouter and more robust than those of other [[diplodocid]]s and were found to be most similar to ''Camarasaurus'' by [[Charles Whitney Gilmore]]. < ref name= \" gilmore36 \" / > < ref name= \" twne15 \" / >  In addition, they support [[Cervical rib#Other animals|cervical ribs]] that extend farther towards the ground than in diplodocines, and have vertebrae and ribs that are narrower towards the top of the neck, making the neck nearly triangular in cross-section. < ref name= \" twne15 \" / >  In ''Apatosaurus louisae'', the [[atlas (anatomy)|atlas]]-[[axis (anatomy)|axis]] complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused. The dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae and are instead loosely articulated. < ref name= \" gilmore36 \" / >  ''Apatosaurus'' has ten dorsal ribs on either side of the body. < ref name= \" riggs-1903 \" / >  The large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. ''Apatosaurus'', like its close relative ''[[Supersaurus]]'', has tall neural spines, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones of its vertebrae. The shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid; it is comparatively slender because of the rapidly decreasing height of the vertebral spines with increasing distance from the hips. ''Apatosaurus'' also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving it an unusually deep chest. < ref name=LHW07/ >  As in other diplodocids, the tail transformed into a whip-like structure towards the end. < ref name= \" gilmore36 \" / > \n \n [[File:Apatosaurus louisae by durbed.jpg|thumb|[[Paleoart|Artistic interpretation]] of ''A. louisae'']] \n The limb bones are also very robust. < ref name=LHW07/ >  Within [[Apatosaurinae]], the [[scapula]] of ''Apatosaurus louisae'' is intermediate in morphology between those of ''A.{{nbsp}}ajax'' and ''Brontosaurus excelsus''. The arm bones are stout, so the [[humerus]] of ''Apatosaurus'' resembles that of ''Camarasaurus'', as well as ''Brontosaurus''. However, the humeri of ''Brontosaurus'' and ''A.{{nbsp}}ajax'' are more similar to each other than they are to ''A.{{nbsp}}louisae''. In 1936 [[Charles W. Gilmore|Charles Gilmore]] noted that previous reconstructions of ''Apatosaurus'' forelimbs erroneously proposed that the [[Radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]] could cross; in life they would have remained parallel. < ref name= \" gilmore36 \" / >  ''Apatosaurus'' had a single large claw on each forelimb, a feature shared by all sauropods more derived than ''[[Shunosaurus]]''. < ref name= \" gilmore36 \" / > < ref name= \" upchurchmanus \" / >  The first three toes had claws on each hindlimb. The phalangeal formula is 2-1-1-1-1, meaning the innermost finger (phalanx) on the forelimb has two bones and the next has one. < ref name= \" martin06 \" / >  The single manual claw bone ([[ungual]]) is slightly curved and squarely [[:wikt:truncated|truncated]] on the anterior end. The pelvic girdle includes the robust [[ilium bone|ilia]], and the fused (co-ossified) [[pubic bone|pubes]] and [[ischium|ischia]]. The femora of ''Apatosaurus'' are very stout and represent some of the most robust femora of any member of Sauropoda. The tibia and fibula bones are different from the slender bones of ''Diplodocus'' but are nearly indistinguishable from those of ''Camarasaurus''. The fibula is longer and slenderer than the tibia. The foot of ''Apatosaurus'' has three claws on the innermost digits; the digit formula is 3-4-5-3-2. The first metatarsal is the stoutest, a feature shared among diplodocids. < ref name= \" gilmore36 \" / > < ref name= \" Upchurch05 \" / > \n \n ==Discovery and species== \n [[File:Apatosaurus ajax sacrum.jpg|thumb|''A. ajax'' sacrum, illustrated in 1879]] \n The first ''Apatosaurus'' bones were discovered by [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and the name ''Apatosaurus ajax'' was coined in 1877 by Cope's rival [[Othniel Charles Marsh]], Professor of [[Paleontology]] at [[Yale University]], based on a nearly complete skeleton (holotype, [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|YPM]]{{nbsp}}1860) discovered in the eastern foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[Gunnison County, Colorado]]. < ref name= \" riggs-1903 \" / > < ref name= \" marsh1877 \" / > < ref name=TMB2015/ >  The composite term ''Apatosaurus'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''{{lang|grc-Latn|apat\u0113}}'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c0\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7}})/''{{lang|grc-Latn|apat\u0113los}}'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2}}) meaning  \" deception \" / \" deceptive \" , and ''{{lang|grc-Latn|sauros}}'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2]]}}) meaning  \" lizard \" ; < ref name= \" liddell \" / >  thus,  \" deceptive lizard \" . Marsh gave it this name based on the [[chevron (anatomy)|chevron]] bones, which are dissimilar to those of other dinosaurs; instead, the chevron bones of ''Apatosaurus'' showed similarities with those of [[mosasaur]]s, < ref name= \" marsh1877 \"  / > < ref name= \" Holtz2008 \"  / >  most likely that of the representative species ''[[Mosasaurus]]''. During excavation and transportation, the bones of the holotype skeleton were mixed with those of another ''Apatosaurus'' individual originally described as ''Atlantosaurus immanis''; as a consequence, some elements cannot be ascribed to either specimen with confidence. < ref name= \" TMB2015 \"  / >  Marsh distinguished the new genus ''Apatosaurus'' from ''[[Atlantosaurus]]'' on the basis of the number of sacral vertebrae, with ''Apatosaurus'' possessing three and ''Atlantosaurus'' four. Two years later, Marsh announced the discovery of a larger and more complete specimen at [[Como Bluff]], [[Wyoming]]. He gave this specimen a new name based on the conventions of his age and the relatively sparse fossil record available at that time. It was later recognised that the features he had used to distinguish genera and species were in fact more widespread among sauropods. < ref name= \" riggs-1903 \"  / > < ref name= \" TMB2015 \"  / >  He named the new species ''Brontosaurus excelsus''. < ref name= \" marsh1879 \" / >  All specimens currently considered ''Apatosaurus'' were from the Morrison Formation, the location of the excavations of Marsh and Cope. < ref name=OM06/ > \n \n [[File:Sharp lull brontosaurus.jpg|thumb|left|Obsolete mount of an apatosaurine (possibly ''Apatosaurus'') specimen AMNH{{nbsp}}460 with sculpted skull, [[American Museum of Natural History]]]] \n Another specimen, in the American Museum of Natural History under specimen number{{nbsp}}460, which is occasionally assigned to ''Apatosaurus'', is considered nearly complete; only the head, feet, and sections of the tail are missing, and it was the first sauropod skeleton mounted. < ref name= \" Bakker \" / >  The specimen was found north of [[Medicine Bow, Wyoming]], in 1898 by [[Walter W.

In addition, a sculpted model of what the museum thought the skull of this massive creature might look like was made. This was not a delicate skull like that of ''Diplodocus''{{snd}}which was later found to be more accurate{{snd}}but was based on  \" the biggest, thickest, strongest skull bones, lower jaws and tooth crowns from three different quarries \" . < ref name= \" gilmore36 \" / > < ref name= \" riggs-1903 \" / > < ref name= \" Bakker \" / > < ref name= \" mcintosh & berman1975 \" / >  These skulls were likely those of ''Camarasaurus'', the only other sauropod for which good skull material was known at the time. The mount construction was overseen by Adam Hermann, who failed to find ''Apatosaurus'' skulls. Hermann was forced to sculpt a stand-in skull by hand. Osborn said in a publication that the skull was  \" largely conjectural and based on that of ''Morosaurus'' \"  (now ''Camarasaurus''). < ref name= \" camarasaurusbully \" / > \n [[File:Field Museum Apatosaurus with original incorrect skull.jpg|thumb|Apatosaurine mount (FMNH P25112) in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in the 1950s, with its original, inaccurately reconstructed skull]] \n In 1903 [[Elmer S. Riggs|Elmer Riggs]] published a study that described a well-preserved skeleton of a diplodocid from the [[Grand Valley (Colorado-Utah)|Grand River Valley]] near [[Fruita, Colorado]], Field Museum of Natural History specimen P25112. Riggs thought that the deposits were similar in age to those of the Como Bluff in Wyoming from which Marsh had described ''Brontosaurus''. Most of the skeleton was found, and after comparison with both ''Brontosaurus'' and ''Apatosaurus ajax'', Riggs realized that the holotype of ''A.{{nbsp}}ajax'' was immature, and thus the features distinguishing the genera were not valid. Since ''Apatosaurus'' was the earlier name, ''Brontosaurus'' should be considered a junior synonym of ''Apatosaurus''. Because of this, Riggs recombined ''Brontosaurus excelsus'' as ''Apatosaurus excelsus''. Based on comparisons with other species proposed to belong to ''Apatosaurus'', Riggs also determined that the Field Columbian Museum specimen was likely most similar to ''A.{{nbsp}}excelsus''. < ref name= \" riggs-1903 \" / > \n \n Despite Riggs' publication, [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], who was a strong opponent of Marsh and his taxa, labeled the ''Apatosaurus'' mount of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] ''Brontosaurus''. < ref name= \" camarasaurusbully \" / > < ref name= \" parsons \" / >  Because of this decision the name ''Brontosaurus'' was commonly used outside of scientific literature for what Riggs considered ''Apatosaurus'', and the museum's popularity meant that ''Brontosaurus'' became one of the best known dinosaurs, even though it was invalid throughout nearly all of the 20th and early 21st centuries. < ref name= \" crafton82 \" > {{cite book|last1=Crafton|first1=D.C.|title=Before Mickey: The Animated Film 1898\u20131928|publisher=MIT Press|year=1982|isbn=978-0-262-03083-0|url=http://www.micheleleigh.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Crafton.pdf|pages=1\u201357}} < /ref > \n [[File:Apatosaurus louisae side (Morrison Formation, Upper Jurassic; Carnegie Quarry, Dinosaur National Monument, northeastern Utah, USA).jpg|thumb|left|Side view of ''A. louisae'' CM{{nbsp}}3018 mounted with a cast of skull CM{{nbsp}}11162]] \n It was not until 1909 that an ''Apatosaurus'' skull was found during the first expedition, led by Earl Douglass, to what would become known as the Carnegie Quarry at [[Dinosaur National Monument]]. The skull was found a short distance from a skeleton (specimen CM{{nbsp}}3018) identified as the new species ''Apatosaurus louisae'', named after [[Louise Whitfield Carnegie|Louise Carnegie]], wife of [[Andrew Carnegie]], who funded field research to find complete dinosaur skeletons in the American West. The skull was designated CM{{nbsp}}11162; it was very similar to the skull of ''Diplodocus''. < ref name= \" parsons \" / >  Another smaller skeleton of ''A.{{nbsp}}louisae'' was found nearby CM{{nbsp}}11162 and CM{{nbsp}}3018. < ref name= \" glut1977 \" / >  The skull was accepted as belonging to the ''Apatosaurus'' specimen by Douglass and Carnegie Museum director William H. Holland, although other scientists{{snd}}most notably Osborn{{snd}}rejected this identification. Holland defended his view in 1914 in an address to the Paleontological Society of America, yet he left the Carnegie Museum mount headless. While some thought Holland was attempting to avoid conflict with Osborn, others suspected Holland was waiting until an articulated skull and neck were found to confirm the association of the skull and skeleton. < ref name= \" camarasaurusbully \" / >  After Holland's death in 1934, museum staff placed a cast of a ''Camarasaurus'' skull on the mount. < ref name= \" parsons \" / > \n \n While most other museums were using cast or sculpted ''Camarasaurus'' skulls on ''Apatosaurus'' mounts, the Yale Peabody Museum decided to sculpt a skull based on the lower jaw of a ''Camarasaurus'', with the cranium based on Marsh's 1891 illustration of the skull. The skull also included forward-pointing nasals{{snd}}something unusual for any dinosaur{{snd}}and fenestrae differing from both the drawing and other skulls. < ref name= \" camarasaurusbully \" / > \n [[File:Apatosaurus Einstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Skull of BYU 17096 ( \" Einstein \" ) in front view]] \n No ''Apatosaurus'' skull was mentioned in literature until the 1970s when John Stanton McIntosh and David Berman redescribed the skulls of ''Diplodocus'' and ''Apatosaurus''. They found that though he never published his opinion, Holland was almost certainly correct, that ''Apatosaurus'' had a ''Diplodocus''-like skull. According to them, many skulls long thought to pertain to ''Diplodocus'' might instead be those of ''Apatosaurus''. They reassigned multiple skulls to ''Apatosaurus'' based on associated and closely associated vertebrae. Even though they supported Holland, it was noted that ''Apatosaurus'' might have possessed a ''Camarasaurus''-like skull, based on a disarticulated ''Camarasaurus''-like tooth found at the precise site where an ''Apatosaurus'' specimen was found years before. < ref name= \" mcintosh & berman1975 \" / >  On October{{nbsp}}20, 1979, after the publications by McIntosh and Berman, the first true skull of ''Apatosaurus'' was mounted on a skeleton in a museum, that of the Carnegie. < ref name= \" parsons \" / >  In 1998 it was suggested that the Felch Quarry skull that Marsh had included in his 1896 skeletal restoration instead belonged to ''[[Brachiosaurus]]''. < ref name= \" carpenter98 \" / >  In 2011 the first specimen of ''Apatosaurus'' where a skull was found articulated with its cervical vertebrae was described. This specimen, [[Cincinnati Museum Center|CMC]]{{nbsp}}VP{{nbsp}}7180, was found to differ in both skull and neck features from ''A.{{nbsp}}louisae'', but shared many features of the cervical vertebrae with ''A.{{nbsp}}ajax''. < ref name= \" barrettetal11 \" / >  Another well-preserved skull is [[Brigham Young University]] specimen 17096, a well-preserved skull and skeleton, with a preserved braincase. The specimen was found in Cactus Park Quarry in western [[Colorado]]. < ref name= \" balanoff2010 \" / > \n [[File:Brontosaurus infographic.svg|thumb|left|400px|Infographic explaining the history of ''Brontosaurus'' and ''Apatosaurus'' according to Tschopp ''et{{nbsp}}al.'' 2015]] \n Almost all modern paleontologists agreed with Riggs that the two dinosaurs should be classified together in a single genus. According to the rules of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name ''Apatosaurus'', having been published first, has priority as the official name; ''Brontosaurus'' was considered a [[synonym (taxonomy)|junior synonym]] and was therefore long discarded from formal use. < ref name= \" taylor10 \" / > < ref name= \" endeavour \" / > < ref name= \" Dinosauria04 \" / > < ref name= \" Macintosh \" / >  Despite this, at least one paleontologist{{snd}}[[Robert T. Bakker]]{{snd}}argued in the 1990s that ''A.{{nbsp}}ajax'' and ''A.{{nbsp}}excelsus'' were in fact sufficiently distinct for the latter to merit a separate genus. < ref name= \" Bakker98 \" / > \n \n In 2015, Emanuel Tschopp, [[Oct\u00e1vio Mateus]], and Roger Benson released a paper on diplodocoid systematics, and proposed that genera could be diagnosed by thirteen differing characters, and species separated based on six. The minimum number for generic separation was chosen based on the fact that ''A.{{nbsp}}ajax'' and ''A.{{nbsp}}louisae'' differ in twelve characters, and ''Diplodocus carnegiei'' and ''D.{{nbsp}}hallorum'' differ in eleven characters. Thus, thirteen characters were chosen to validate the separation of genera. The six differing features for specific separation were chosen by counting the number of differing features in separate specimens generally agreed to represent one species, with only one differing character in ''D.{{nbsp}}carnegiei'' and ''A.{{nbsp}}louisae'', but five differing features in ''B.{{nbsp}}excelsus''. Therefore, Tschopp et{{nbsp}}al. argued that ''Apatosaurus excelsus'', originally classified as ''Brontosaurus excelsus'', had enough morphological differences from other species of ''Apatosaurus'' that it warranted being reclassified as a separate genus again. The conclusion was based on a comparison of 477 morphological characteristics across 81 different dinosaur individuals. Among the many notable differences are the wider{{snd}}and presumably stronger{{snd}}neck of ''Apatosaurus'' species compared to ''B.{{nbsp}}excelsus''. Other species previously assigned to ''Apatosaurus'', such as ''Elosaurus parvus'' and ''Eobrontosaurus yahnahpin'' were also reclassified as ''Brontosaurus''. Some features proposed to separate ''Brontosaurus'' from ''Apatosaurus'' include: posterior dorsal vertebrae with the centrum longer than wide; the scapula rear to the [[acromion|acromial edge]] and the distal blade being excavated; the acromial edge of the distal scapular blade bearing a rounded expansion; and the ratio of the proximodistal length to transverse breadth of the [[Talus bone|astragalus]] 0.55 or greater. < ref name=TMB2015/ >  Sauropod expert [[Michael Daniel D'Emic]] pointed out that the criteria chosen were to an extent arbitrary and that they would require abandoning the name ''Brontosaurus'' again if newer analyses obtained different results. < ref name= \" d'emic 2015 \" > D'Emic, M. 2015.

Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upward, and that sauropods like ''Apatosaurus'' were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding. < ref name= \" StevensParrish99 \" / > < ref name= \" stevens05 \" / > < ref name= \" Upchurch2000 \" / > \n \n Other studies by Taylor find that all [[tetrapod]]s appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture; they argue the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals. ''Apatosaurus'', like ''Diplodocus'', would have held its neck angled upward with the head pointing downward in a resting posture. < ref name= \" taylor14 \" / > < ref name= \" taylor09 \" / >  Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) state ''Apatosaurus'' had a great feeding range; its neck could bend into a U-shape laterally. < ref name= \" StevensParrish99 \" / >  The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to feed at the level of the feet. < ref name= \" stevens05 \" / > \n \n Matthew Cobley ''et al.''

They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like ''Diplodocus'' were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. < ref name=Cobley/ > < ref name= \" ghose \" / >  The conclusions of Cobley ''et{{nbsp}}al.'' are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility of the neck of ''Apatosaurus'' and ''Diplodocus''.

Beginning with the assumption that, like [[crocodilia]]ns, ''Apatosaurus'' did not have a [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], the [[dead space (physiology)|dead-space volume]] (the amount of unused air remaining in the mouth, trachea, and air tubes after each breath) has been estimated at about {{convert|184|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} for a {{convert|30|t|LT ST|abbr=on}} specimen. Paladino calculates its [[lung volumes|tidal volume]] (the amount of air moved in or out during a single breath) at {{convert|904|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} with an avian respiratory system, {{convert|225|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} if mammalian, and {{convert|19|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} if reptilian. < ref name= \" paladinoetal1997 \" / > \n \n On this basis, its respiratory system would likely have been [[parabronchi]], with multiple pulmonary air sacs as in [[avian lungs]], and a flow-through lung. An avian respiratory system would need a lung volume of about {{convert|600|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} compared with a mammalian requirement of {{convert|2,950|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}}, which would exceed the space available. The overall thoracic volume of ''Apatosaurus'' has been estimated at {{convert|1,700|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}}, allowing for a {{convert|500|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}}, four-chambered heart and a {{convert|900|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} lung capacity. That would allow about {{convert|300|l|m3|order=flip|abbr=on}} for the necessary tissue. < ref name= \" paladinoetal1997 \" / >  Evidence for the avian system in ''Apatosaurus'' and other sauropods is also present in the [[Skeletal pneumaticity|pneumaticity]] of the vertebrae. Though this plays a role in reducing the weight of the animal, Wedel (2003) states they are also likely connected to air sacs, as in birds. < ref name= \" Wedel 2003 \" / > \n \n James Spotila ''et al.'' (1991) concludes that the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to maintain high metabolic rates because they would not have been able to release enough heat. < ref name= \" spotila91 \" / >  They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. < ref name= \" Wedel 2003 \" / >  Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. < ref name= \" Pierson \" / >  Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated. < ref name= \" StevensParrish99 \" / > \n \n James Farlow (1987) calculates that an ''Apatosaurus''-sized dinosaur about {{convert|35|t|LT ST|abbr=on}} would have possessed {{convert|5.7|t|LT ST|abbr=on}} of fermentation contents. < ref name= \" farlow87 \" / >  Assuming ''Apatosaurus'' had an avian respiratory system and a reptilian resting-metabolism, Frank Paladino et{{nbsp}}al.

They said that by using growth lines and length-to-mass ratios, ''Apatosaurus'' would have grown to 25{{nbsp}}t (25 long tons; 28 short tons) in 15{{nbsp}}years, with growth peaking at {{convert|5000|kg|abbr=on|-2}} in a single year. An alternative method, using limb length and body mass, found ''Apatosaurus'' grew {{convert|520|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per year, and reached its full mass before it was about 70{{nbsp}}years old. < ref name= \" lehman & woodward \" / >  These estimates have been called unreliable because the calculation methods are not sound; old growth lines would have been obliterated by bone remodelling. < ref name= \" griebeler \" / >  One of the first identified growth factors of ''Apatosaurus'' was the number of sacral vertebrae, which increased to five by the time of the creature's maturity. This was first noted in 1903 and again in 1936. < ref name= \" gilmore36 \" / > \n \n Long-bone histology enables researchers to estimate the age that a specific individual reached.

The same growth model indicated ''Apatosaurus'' sp.{{nbsp}}BYU 601\u201317328 weighed {{convert|18178|kg|ST|1|abbr=on}}, reached sexual maturity at 19{{nbsp}}years, and died aged 31. < ref name= \" griebeler \" / > \n \n ====Juveniles==== \n Compared with most sauropods, a relatively large amount of juvenile material is known from ''Apatosaurus''. Multiple specimens in the OMNH are from juveniles of an undetermined species of ''Apatosaurus''; this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles, some vertebrae, and limb bones. OMNH juvenile material is from at least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals. The specimens exhibit features that distinguish ''Apatosaurus'' from its relatives, and thus likely belong to the genus. < ref name= \" Upchurch05 \" / > < ref name= \" carpenter & mcintosh94 \" / >  Juvenile sauropods tend to have proportionally shorter necks and tails, and a more pronounced forelimb-hindlimb disparity than found in adult sauropods. < ref name= \" svpowbabyapato \" / > \n \n ===Tail=== \n An article published in 1997 reported research of the mechanics of ''Apatosaurus'' tails by [[Nathan Myhrvold]] and paleontologist [[Philip J. Currie]]. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like ''Apatosaurus'' was a very long, tapering structure resembling a [[bullwhip]]. This computer modeling suggested diplodocids were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 [[decibel]]s, comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired. < ref name= \" myhrvold \" / > \n \n A pathology has been identified on the tail of ''Apatosaurus'', caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might have been caused by the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. < ref name= \" lovelace14 \" / >  It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat and defense, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to ''[[Shunosaurus]]'' and [[mamenchisaurid]]s, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself. < ref name= \" myhrvold \" > {{cite journal|last1=Myhrvold|first1=N.P.|last2=Currie|first2=P.J.|title=Supersonic sauropods?

Additional ''Apatosaurus'' remains are known from similarly aged or slightly younger rocks, but they have not been identified as any particular species, < ref name=turner1999/ >  and thus may instead belong to ''Brontosaurus''. < ref name=TMB2015/ > \n \n The Morrison Formation records a time when the local environment was dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs. < ref name= \" foster-2007 \" / >  Dinosaurs known from the Morrison Formation include the theropods ''[[Allosaurus]]'', ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', ''[[Ornitholestes]]'', ''[[Saurophaganax]]'', and ''[[Torvosaurus]]''; the sauropods ''Brontosaurus'', ''Brachiosaurus'', ''Camarasaurus'', and ''Diplodocus''; and the [[ornithischia]]ns ''[[Camptosaurus]]'', ''[[Dryosaurus]]'', and ''[[Stegosaurus]]''. < ref name=DJCetal06/ >  ''Apatosaurus'' is commonly found at the same sites as ''Allosaurus'', ''Camarasaurus'', ''Diplodocus'', and ''Stegosaurus''. < ref name=DBBM80/ >  ''Allosaurus'' accounted for 70\u201375% of theropod specimens and was at the top [[trophic level]] of the Morrison food web. < ref name=JRF03a/ >  Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are of the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks of the [[Lourinh\u00e3 Formation]]{{snd}}mainly ''Allosaurus'', ''Ceratosaurus'', and ''Torvosaurus''{{snd}}or have a close counterpart{{snd}}''Brachiosaurus'' and ''[[Lusotitan]]'', ''Camptosaurus'' and ''[[Draconyx]]'', and ''Apatosaurus'' and ''[[Dinheirosaurus]]''. < ref name=OM06/ >  Other vertebrates that are known to have shared this paleo-environment include [[actinopterygii|ray-finned fishes]], frogs, [[salamander]]s, turtles, [[sphenodontia|sphenodonts]], lizards, terrestrial and aquatic [[crocodylomorpha]]ns, and several species of [[pterosaur]]. Shells of [[bivalve]]s and aquatic snails are also common. The flora of the period has been evidenced in fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, [[equisetum|horsetails]], [[cycad]]s, [[ginkgo]]es, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of [[tree fern]]s with fern [[understory]] ([[gallery forest]]s), to fern [[savanna]]s with occasional trees such as the ''[[Araucaria]]''-like conifer ''[[Brachyphyllum]]''. < ref name=KC06/ > \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist|30em|refs= \n < ref name= \" marsh1877 \" > {{cite journal |url=http://marsh.dinodb.com/marsh/Marsh%201877%20-%20Notice%20of%20new%20dinosaurian%20reptiles%20from%20the%20Jurassic%20formation.pdf |title=Notice of New Dinosaurian Reptiles from the Jurassic formation |date=1877 |last=Marsh |first=O.C. |author-link=Othniel Charles Marsh |journal=American Journal of Science |volume=14 |issue=84 |pages=514\u2013516|bibcode=1877AmJS...14..514M |doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-14.84.514 |s2cid=130488291 }} < /ref > \n \n < ref name= \" marsh1878 \" > {{cite journal |url=http://marsh.dinodb.com/marsh/Marsh%201878%20-%20Principle%20characters%20of%20American%20Jurassic%20dinosaurs,%20Part%20I.pdf |title=Principal Characters of American Jurassic Dinosaurs |last=Marsh |first=O.C. |journal=American Journal of Science |year=1878 |volume=16 |issue=95 |pages=412\u2013414}} < /ref > \n \n < ref name= \" marsh1879 \" > {{cite journal |url=http://marsh.dinodb.com/marsh/Marsh%201879%20-%20Notice%20of%20new%20Jurassic%20reptiles.pdf |title=Notice of new Jurassic dinosaurs |last=Marsh |first=O.C. |journal=American Journal of Science |year=1879 |volume=18 |issue=108 |pages=501\u2013505|bibcode=1879AmJS...18..501M |doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-18.108.501 |s2cid=131001110 }} < /ref > \n \n < ref name= \" riggs-1903 \" > {{cite journal |url=http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/tmp/Riggs-1903_Structure%20and%20relationships%20of%20opisthocoelian%20dinosaurs.%20Part%20I.%20Apatosaurus%20Marsh.pdf |title=Structure and Relationships of Opisthocoelian Dinosaurs.
