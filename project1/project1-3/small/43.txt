The city was burned by [[Edward III of England]] in 1336, but was rebuilt and extended. The city was strongly fortified to prevent attacks by neighbouring lords, but the gates were removed by 1770. \n \n During the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] of 1644 to 1647 the city was plundered by both sides. In 1644, it was taken and ransacked by Royalist troops after the [[Battle of Aberdeen (1644)|Battle of Aberdeen]] < ref > {{Cite book|first=Chris |last=Brown |title=The Battle of Aberdeen 1644|year=2002|publisher=Tempus Publishing |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire}} < /ref >  and two years later [[Battle of Aberdeen (1646)|it was stormed]] by a Royalist force under the command of the [[George Gordon, 2nd Marquis of Huntly|Marquis of Huntly]]. < ref > {{Cite DNB|last=Henderson |first=Thomas Finlayson |wstitle=Gordon, George (d.1649)  |volume=22 |pages=190\u2013194}} < /ref >  In 1647 an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] killed a quarter of the population.

The council began major road improvements at the end of the 18th century with the main thoroughfares of [[George Street, Aberdeen|George Street]], [[King Street, Aberdeen|King Street]] and [[Union Street, Aberdeen|Union Street]] all completed at the beginning of the 19th century. \n \n The expensive infrastructure works led to the city becoming bankrupt in 1817 during the [[Post-Napoleonic depression]], an economic downturn immediately after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; but the city's prosperity later recovered. The increasing economic importance of Aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries led to the construction of the present harbour including Victoria Dock and the South Breakwater, and the extension of the North Pier. Gas street lighting arrived in 1824 and an enhanced water supply appeared in 1830 when water was pumped from the Dee to a reservoir in Union Place. An underground sewer system replaced open sewers in 1865. < ref name= \" fraser \" / >  The city was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1891.

The steam trawling industry expanded and by 1933 Aberdeen was Scotland's top fishing port, employing nearly 3,000 men with 300 vessels sailing from its harbour. By the time oil was coming on stream, much of the trawling fleet had relocated to [[Peterhead]]. Although Aberdeen still brings in substantial catches, the tugs, safety vessels and supply ships which pack the harbour far outnumber the trawlers. \n \n Geologists had speculated about the existence of oil and gas in the North Sea since the middle of the 20th century, but tapping its deep and inhospitable waters was another story. With the Middle Eastern oil sheiks becoming more aware of the political and economic power of their oil reserves and government threats of rationing, the industry began to consider the North Sea as a viable source of oil. Exploration commenced in the 1960s and the first major find in the British sector was in November 1970 in the Forties field, {{convert|110|mi}} east of Aberdeen. < ref name= \" :1 \"  / > \n \n By late 1975, after years of intense construction the necessary infrastructure was in place. In Aberdeen, at BP's (British Petroleum) headquarters, the Queen pressed the button that would set the whole thing moving. Oil flowed from the rig directly to the refinery at far-away Grangemouth. While many ports have suffered decline, Aberdeen remains busy because of the oil trade and the influx of people connected with the industry, a subsequent rise in property prices have brought prosperity to the area. \n \n The industry supports about 47,000 jobs locally, and known reserves ensure that oil will continue to flow well into the 21st century. As a major port in the UK, Aberdeen receives many ships calling at the port. Seafarers' welfare organisation, [[Apostleship of the Sea]] has a port chaplain in Aberdeen to offer practical and pastoral support to them. \n \n ===Business=== \n In 2011, the Centre for Cities named Aberdeen as the best placed city for growth in Britain, as the country looked to emerge from the recent economic downturn. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12261716|title=Aberdeen 'best-placed city for growth' in Britain|work=BBC News|access-date=18 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127074124/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12261716|archive-date=27 January 2011|url-status=live}} < /ref >  With energy still providing the backbone of the local economy, recent years have seen very large new investment in the North Sea owing to rising oil prices and favourable government tax incentives. < ref > {{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/9991640/Record-rise-in-North-Sea-oil-and-gas-investment-expected.html|title=Record rise in North Sea oil and gas investment expected|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=3 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010084615/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/9991640/Record-rise-in-North-Sea-oil-and-gas-investment-expected.html|archive-date=10 October 2013|url-status=live}} < /ref >  This has led to several oil majors and independents building new global offices in the city. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.engie-ep.com/en/news-and-media/news/2013/21-02-2013.aspx?sc_lang=en|title=Construction gets underway for new GDF Suez E & P UK Aberdeen premises|publisher=GDF Suez E & P|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830085637/http://www.engie-ep.com/en/news-and-media/news/2013/21-02-2013.aspx?sc_lang%3Den|archive-date=30 August 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=3 August 2013}} < /ref > \n \n Aberdeen City and Shire's Gross Domestic Product is estimated at over \u00a311.4 billion, accounting for over 17% of the overall Scottish GDP.

The hard grey stone is one of the most durable materials available and helps to explain why the city's buildings look brand-new when they have been newly cleaned and the cement has been pointed. Unlike other Scottish cities where [[sandstone]] has been used, the buildings are not weathering and need very little structural maintenance on their masonry. The buildings can however become noticeably darker as a result of pollution and grime accumulated over the years. There has however been great success in cleaning the buildings which can result in their fa\u00e7ade being restored back to much how they looked originally. \n \n Amongst the notable buildings in the city's main street, [[Union Street, Aberdeen|Union Street]], are the Town and County Bank, [[The Music Hall (Aberdeen)|the Music Hall]], the [[Seven Incorporated Trades of Aberdeen|Trinity Hall of the incorporated trades]] (originating between 1398 and 1527, although completely rebuilt in the 1860s), now a shopping mall; the former office of the Northern Assurance Company, and the [[National Bank of Scotland]].

[[Aberdeen F.C.]] (The Dons) play in the [[Scottish Premiership]] at [[Pittodrie Stadium]]. The club won the [[European Cup Winners Cup]] and the [[European Super Cup]] in 1983, the [[Scottish Premier League]] Championship four times (1955, 1980, 1984 and 1985), and the [[Scottish Cup]] seven times (1947, 1970, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986 and 1990). Under the management of [[Alex Ferguson]], Aberdeen was a major force in British football during the 1980s.  \n \n After 8 seasons in charge, the most recent of Managers Derek McInnes, was relieved of his duties, the club's failure to achieve anything more than 1 trophy in 24 competitions during his tenure and a recent run of games which saw 1 goal in ten matches ultimately proved costly for the Manager and his Assistant Tony Docherty. Under the management of McInnes the team won the [[2014 Scottish League Cup Final|2014]] [[Scottish League Cup]] and followed it up with a second place league finish for the first time for more than 20 years in the following season.  But it was over the last few seasons that results stagnated and Derek was replaced by former Aberdeen and Newcastle player [[Stephen Glass (footballer)]]. \n There are plans to build a [[new Aberdeen Stadium]] in the future.  \n \n The other senior team is [[Cove Rangers F.C.|Cove Rangers]] of [[Scottish League One|League One]], who play at [[Balmoral Stadium]] in the suburb of [[Cove Bay]]. Cove won the [[Highland Football League]] championship in 2001, 2008, 2009, 2013 and 2019, winning the League Two play-offs in 2019 and earning [[2019\u201320 Scottish League Two|promotion]]. At the point at which the 2019/20 League Two season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Cove were sitting top of the [[Scottish League Two|League Two]] table and thus were promoted as Champions. This means that the city of Aberdeen has two clubs in Scottish football's senior leagues for the first time in history. \n \n There was also a historic senior team [[Bon Accord F.C.]] who no longer play. Local junior teams include [[Banks O' Dee F.C.]], [[Culter F.C.]], [[F.C.
