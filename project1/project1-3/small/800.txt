Ataxia is a clinical manifestation indicating dysfunction of the parts of the [[nervous system]] that coordinate movement, such as the [[cerebellum]]. Ataxia can be limited to one side of the body, which is referred to as hemiataxia. Several possible causes exist for these patterns of neurological dysfunction. Dystaxia is a mild degree of ataxia. [[Friedreich's ataxia]] has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom. < ref > dystaxia. (n.d.). The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary.

For example, if a movement required reaching to touch a target in front of the body, [[flexion]] at the [[shoulder]] would create a torque at the [[elbow]], while [[extension (kinesiology)|extension]] of the elbow would create a torque at the [[wrist]]. These torques increase as the speed of movement increases and must be compensated and adjusted for to create coordinated movement. This may, therefore, explain decreased coordination at higher movement velocities and accelerations. \n * [[Vestibulocerebellar syndrome|Dysfunction of the vestibulocerebellum]] ([[flocculonodular lobe]]) impairs balance and the control of eye movements. This presents itself with [[postural instability]], in which the person tends to separate his/her feet upon standing, to gain a wider base and to avoid titubation (bodily oscillations tending to be forward-backward ones). The instability is, therefore, worsened when standing with the feet together, regardless of whether the eyes are open or closed. This is a negative [[Romberg's test]], or more accurately, it denotes the individual's inability to carry out the test, because the individual feels unstable even with open eyes. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} \n * '''Dysfunction of the [[Anatomy of the cerebellum#Phylogenetic and functional divisions|spinocerebellum]]'''  ([[vermis]] and associated areas near the midline) presents itself with a wide-based  \" drunken sailor \"  [[gait]] (called truncal ataxia), < ref name= \" Blumenfeld \" > {{cite book | vauthors = Blumenfeld H | title = Neuroanatomy through clinical cases | url = https://archive.org/details/neuroanatomythro00blum | url-access = limited | publisher = Sinauer | location = Sunderland, Mass | year = 2002 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/neuroanatomythro00blum/page/n342 670]\u2013671 | isbn = 0-87893-060-4 }} < /ref >  characterised by uncertain starts and stops, lateral deviations, and unequal steps.

This is generally caused by dysfunction of the [[dorsal columns]] of the spinal cord, because they carry proprioceptive information up to the brain. In some cases, the cause of sensory ataxia may instead be dysfunction of the various parts of the brain that receive positional information, including the cerebellum, [[thalamus]], and [[parietal lobe]]s. \n \n Sensory ataxia presents itself with an unsteady  \" stomping \"  gait with heavy [[heel]] strikes, as well as a postural instability that is usually worsened when the lack of proprioceptive input cannot be compensated for by [[visual perception|visual input]], such as in poorly lit environments. \n \n Physicians can find evidence of sensory ataxia during [[physical examination]] by having patients stand with their feet together and [[Human eye|eye]]s shut. In affected patients, this will cause the instability to worsen markedly, producing wide oscillations and possibly a fall; this is called a positive [[Romberg's test]]. Worsening of the finger-pointing test with the eyes closed is another feature of sensory ataxia. Also, when patients are standing with arms and hands extended toward the physician, if the eyes are closed, the patients' fingers tend to  \" fall down \"  and then be restored to the horizontal extended position by sudden muscular contractions (the  \" ataxic hand \" ). \n \n === Vestibular === \n The term vestibular ataxia is used to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the [[vestibular system]], which in acute and unilateral cases is associated with prominent [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]]. In slow-onset, chronic bilateral cases of vestibular dysfunction, these characteristic manifestations may be absent, and [[dysequilibrium]] may be the sole presentation. \n \n == Causes == \n The three types of ataxia have overlapping causes, so can either coexist or occur in isolation. Cerebellar ataxia can have many causes despite normal neuroimaging. \n \n === Focal lesions === \n Any type of focal lesion of the [[central nervous system]] (such as [[stroke]], [[brain tumor]], [[multiple sclerosis]], inflammatory [such as [[sarcoidosis]]], and  \" chronic lymphocytyc inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids syndrome \"  [CLIPPERS < ref > {{cite journal | vauthors = Maenhoudt W, Ramboer K, Maqueda V | title = A Rare Cause of Dizziness and Gait Ataxia: CLIPPERS Syndrome | journal = Journal of the Belgian Society of Radiology | volume = 100 | issue = 1 | pages = 20 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 30151443 | pmc = 6102946 | doi = 10.5334/jbr-btr.997 }} < /ref > ]) will cause the type of ataxia corresponding to the site of the lesion: cerebellar if in the cerebellum; sensory if in the dorsal spinal cord...to include cord compression by thickened ligamentum flavum or stenosis of the boney spinal canal...(and rarely in the [[thalamus]] or [[parietal lobe]]); or vestibular if in the vestibular system (including the vestibular areas of the [[cerebral cortex]]). \n \n === Exogenous substances (metabolic ataxia) === \n Exogenous substances that cause ataxia mainly do so because they have a depressant effect on central nervous system function. The most common example is [[ethanol]] (alcohol), which is capable of causing reversible cerebellar and vestibular ataxia. Other examples include various prescription drugs (e.g. most [[antiepileptic drugs]] have cerebellar ataxia as a possible [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effect]]), Lithium level over 1.5mEq/L, [[synthetic cannabinoid]] [[Dexanabinol|HU-211]] ingestion < ref name= \" Inadvertent Ingestion of Marijuana --- Los Angeles, California, 2009 \" > {{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5834a2.htm?s_cid=mm5834a2 |title=Inadvertent Ingestion of Marijuana --- Los Angeles, California, 2009 |access-date=3 September 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511211253/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5834a2.htm?s_cid=mm5834a2 |archive-date=11 May 2011}} < /ref >  and various other medical and recreational drugs (e.g. [[ketamine]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] or [[dextromethorphan]], all of which are [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s that produce a dissociative state at high doses).

Hereditary disorders causing ataxia include [[autosomal dominant]] ones such as [[spinocerebellar ataxia]], [[episodic ataxia]], and [[dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy]], as well as [[autosomal recessive]] disorders such as [[Friedreich's ataxia]] (sensory and cerebellar, with the former predominating) and [[Niemann Pick disease]], [[ataxia-telangiectasia]] (sensory and cerebellar, with the latter predominating), and [[abetalipoproteinaemia]].
