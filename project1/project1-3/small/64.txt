Abu Bakr was persecuted many times by the Quraysh. Though Abu Bakr's beliefs would have been defended by his own clan, it would not be so for the entire Quraysh tribe. \n \n ===Last years in Mecca=== \n In 617, the Quraysh enforced a boycott against the [[Banu Hashim]]. Muhammad along with his supporters from Banu Hashim, were cut off in a pass away from [[Mecca]]. All social relations with the Banu Hashim were cut off and their state was that of imprisonment.{{clarify|date=March 2019}} Before it many Muslims migrated to [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]] (now Ethiopia). Abu Bakr, feeling distressed, set out for Yemen and then to Abyssinia from there. He met a friend of his named Ad-Dughna (chief of the Qarah tribe) outside Mecca, who invited Abu Bakr to seek his protection against the Quraysh. Abu Bakr went back to Mecca, it was a relief for him, but soon due to the pressure of Quraysh, Ad-Dughna was forced to renounce his protection. Once again the Quraysh were free to persecute Abu Bakr. \n \n In 620, Muhammad's uncle and protector, [[Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib]], and Muhammad's wife [[Khadija]] died. Abu Bakr's daughter [[Aisha]] was engaged to Muhammad, however it was decided that the actual marriage ceremony would be held later. In 620 Abu Bakr was the first person to testify to Muhammad's [[Isra and Mi'raj]] (Night Journey). < ref > ''Islam (Exploring Religions)'' by Anne Geldart, published by [[Heinemann (book publisher)|Heinemann Library]], 28 September 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-431-09301-7}} < /ref > \n \n ==Migration to Medina== \n {{Main|Hijra (Islam)}} \n \n In 622, on the invitation of the Muslims of [[Medina]], Muhammad ordered Muslims to migrate to Medina. The migration began in batches. Ali was the last to remain in Mecca, entrusted with responsibility for settling any loans the Muslims had taken out, and famously slept in the bed of Muhammad when the Quraysh, led by Ikrima, attempted to murder Muhammad as he slept. Meanwhile, Abu Bakr accompanied Muhammad to Medina. Due to the danger posed by the Quraysh, they did not take the road, but moved in the opposite direction, taking refuge in a cave in [[Jabal Thawr]], some five miles south of Mecca. [[`Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr]], the son of Abu Bakr, would listen to the plans and discussions of the Quraysh, and at night he would carry the news to the fugitives in the cave. [[Asma bint Abi Bakr]], the daughter of Abu Bakr, brought them meals every day. < ref > ''Islamic Culture'' by the Islamic Cultural Board Published 1927 s.n. Original from the University of Michigan, digitized 27 March 2006. < /ref >  Aamir, a servant of Abu Bakr, would bring a flock of goats to the mouth of the cave every night, where they were milked. The Quraysh sent search parties in all directions. One party came close to the entrance to the cave, but was unable to see them. Due to this, [[Qur'an]] verse {{cite quran|9|40 |s=ns |b=n}} was revealed. [[Aisha]], [[Abu Sa\u2018id al-Khudri]] and [[Abdullah ibn Abbas]] in [[Tafsir|interpreting]] this verse said that Abu Bakr was the companion who stayed with Muhammad in the cave. \n \n After staying at the cave for three days and three nights, Abu Bakr and Muhammad proceed to [[Medina]], staying for some time at Quba, a suburb of Medina. \n \n ===Life in Medina=== \n In Medina, Muhammad decided to construct a mosque. A piece of land was chosen and the price of the land was paid for by Abu Bakr. The Muslims, including Abu Bakr, constructed a mosque named [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] at the site. Abu Bakr was paired with Khaarij ah bin Zaid Ansari (who was from Medina) as a [[Brotherhood among the Sahaba|brother in faith]]. Abu Bakr's relationship with Khaarijah was most cordial, which was further strengthened when Abu Bakr married Habiba, a daughter of Khaarijah.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} Khaarijah bin Zaid Ansari lived at Sunh, a suburb of Medina, and Abu Bakr also settled there. After Abu Bakr's family arrived in Medina, he bought another house near Muhammad's. < ref > [[Hazrat]] ''Abu Bakr, the First Caliph of Islam'' by Muhammad Habibur Rahman Khan Sherwani, published 1963 Sh. Muhammad Ashraf. Original from the University of Michigan. Digitized 14 November 2006. < /ref > \n \n While the climate of Mecca was dry, the climate of Medina was damp and because of this, most of the migrants fell sick on arrival. Abu Bakr contracted a fever for several days, during which time he was attended to by Khaarijah and his family. In Mecca, Abu Bakr was a wholesale trader in cloth and he started the same business in Medina. He opened his new store at Sunh, and from there cloth was supplied to the market at Medina. Soon his business flourished. Early in 623, Abu Bakr's daughter Aisha, who was already engaged to Muhammad, was handed over to Muhammad in a simple marriage ceremony, further strengthening relations between Abu Bakr and Muhammad. < ref name= \" Maghazi \" > Tabqat ibn al-Saad book of Maghazi, page no:62 < /ref > \n \n ==Military campaigns under Muhammad== \n {{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}} \n {{Sunni Islam|Rightly Guided Caliphs}} \n \n ===Battle of Badr=== \n {{Main|Battle of Badr}} \n In 624, Abu Bakr was involved in the first battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh of Mecca, known as the [[Battle of Badr]], but did not fight, instead acting as one of the guards of Muhammad's tent. In relation to this, Ali allegedly later asked his associates as to who they thought was the bravest among men. Everyone stated that Ali was the bravest of all men. Ali then replied: \n \n {{quote|No. Abu Bakr is the bravest of men. In the [[Battle of Badr]] we had prepared a pavillion for the prophet, but when we were asked to offer ourselves for the task of guarding it none came forward except Abu Bakr.

Taken unaware, the advance guard of the Muslim army fled in panic. There was considerable confusion, and the camels, horses and men ran into one another in an attempt to seek cover. Muhammad, however, stood firm. Only nine companions remained around him, including Abu Bakr. Under Muhammad's instruction, [[Abbas ibn Abdul Muttalib|Abbas]] shouted at the top of his voice,  \" O Muslims, come to the Prophet of Allah \" . The call was heard by the Muslim soldiers and they gathered beside Muhammad. When the Muslims had gathered in sufficient number, Muhammad ordered a charge against the enemy. In the hand-to-hand fight that followed the tribes were routed and they fled to [[Autas]]. \n \n Muhammad posted a contingent to guard the Hunayn pass and led the main army to Autas. In the confrontation at Autas the tribes could not withstand the Muslim onslaught. Believing continued resistance useless, the tribes broke camp and retired to Ta'if. \n \n Abu Bakr was commissioned by Muhammad to lead the [[Siege of Ta'if|attack against Ta'if]]. The tribes shut themselves in the fort and refused to come out in the open. The Muslims employed catapults, but without tangible result. The Muslims attempted to use a testudo formation, in which a group of soldiers shielded by a cover of cowhide advanced to set fire to the gate. However, the enemy threw red hot scraps of iron on the testudo, rendering it ineffective. \n \n The siege dragged on for two weeks, and still there was no sign of weakness in the fort. Muhammad held a council of war. Abu Bakr advised that the siege might be raised and that God make arrangements for the fall of the fort. The advice was accepted, and in February 630, the siege of Ta'if was raised and the Muslim army returned to [[Mecca]].

Ali said that he had not come to replace Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj, and that his only mission was to convey a special message to the people on behalf of Muhammad. \n \n At Mecca, Abu Bakr presided at the Hajj ceremony, and Ali read the proclamation on behalf of Muhammad. The main points of the proclamation were: \n \n #Henceforward the non-Muslims were not to be allowed to visit the [[Kaaba]] or perform the pilgrimage. \n #No one should circumambulate the Kaaba naked. \n #[[Polytheism]] was not to be tolerated.

In one such episode, as Muhammad was nearing death, he found himself unable to lead prayers as he usually would. He instructed Abu Bakr to take his place, ignoring concerns from Aisha that her father was too emotionally delicate for the role. Abu Bakr subsequently took up the position, and when Muhammad entered the prayer hall one morning during [[Fajr prayer]]s, Abu Bakr attempted to step back to let him to take up his normal place and lead. Muhammad however, allowed him to continue. In a related incident, around this time, Muhammad ascended the pulpit and addressed the congregation, saying  \" God has given his servant the choice between this world and that which is with God and he has chosen the latter. \"  Abu Bakr, understanding this to mean that Muhammad did not have long to live, responded  \" Nay, we and our children will be your ransom. \"  Muhammad consoled his friend and ordered that all the doors leading to [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi|the mosque]] be closed aside from that which led from Abu Bakr's house,  \" for I know no one who is a better friend to me than he. \" {{sfn|Fitzpatrick|Walker|2014|pp=2\u20133}}{{NoteTag|Such incidents are used by some [[Sunni]]s to justify Abu Bakr's later ascension to the caliphate as they display the regard with which Muhammad held the former.

He then took Umar and another companion, [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]], by the hand and offered them to the Ansar as potential choices. [[Habab ibn Mundhir]], a veteran from the [[Battle of Badr]], countered with his own suggestion that the Quraysh and the Ansar choose a leader each from among themselves, who would then rule jointly.

These insurgencies and the caliphate's responses to them are collectively referred to  as the [[Ridda wars]] ( \" Wars of Apostasy \" ). < ref name=DonnerP85 > {{cite book |last=Donner |first=Fred M. |author-link=Fred Donner |title=The Early Islamic Conquests |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1981 |page=85 |isbn=9781400847877 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5__AwAAQBAJ & pg=PA85 }} < /ref > \n \n The opposition movements came in two forms. One type challenged the political power of the nascent caliphate as well as the religious authority of Islam with the acclamation of rival ideologies, headed by political leaders who claimed the mantle of prophethood in the manner that Muhammad had done. These rebellions include: < ref name=DonnerP85/ > \n *that of the [[Banu Asad ibn Khuzaymah]] headed by [[Tulayha ibn Khuwaylid ibn Nawfal al-Asadi|Tulayha ibn Khuwaylid]] \n *that of the [[Banu Hanifa]] headed by [[Musaylimah]] \n *those from among the [[Banu Taghlib]] and the [[Bani Tamim]] headed by [[Sajah]] \n *that of the [[Al-Ansi]] headed by [[Al-Aswad Al-Ansi]] \n These leaders are all denounced in Islamic histories as  \" false prophets \" . < ref name=DonnerP85/ > \n \n The second form of opposition movement was more strictly political in character. Some of the revolts of this type took the form of tax rebellions in [[Najd]] among tribes such as the [[Banu Fazara]] and [[Banu Tamim]]. Other dissenters, while initially allied to the Muslims, used Muhammad's death as an opportunity to attempt to restrict the growth of the new Islamic state. They include some of the [[Rab\u012b\u02bfa]] in [[Bahrayn]], the [[Azd]] in [[Oman proper|Oman]], as well as among the [[Kindah]] and Khawlan in [[Greater Yemen|Yemen]]. < ref name=DonnerP85/ > \n \n Abu Bakr, likely understanding that maintaining firm control over the disparate tribes of Arabia was crucial to ensuring the survival of the state, suppressed the insurrections with military force. He dispatched [[Khalid ibn Walid]] and a body of troops to subdue the uprisings in Najd as well as that of Musaylimah, who posed the most serious threat. Concurrent to this, [[Shurahbil ibn Hasana]] and [[Al-Ala'a Al-Hadrami]] were sent to Bahrayn, while [[Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl]], [[Hudhayfah al-Bariqi]] and [[Arfaja al-Bariqi]] were instructed to conquer Oman. Finally, [[Al-Muhajir ibn Abi Umayya]] and [[Khalid ibn Asid]] were sent to Yemen to aid the local governor in re-establishing control. Abu Bakr also made use of diplomatic means in addition to military measures. Like Muhammad before him, he utilised marriage alliances and financial incentives to bind former enemies to the caliphate. For instance, a member of the Banu Hanifa who had sided with the Muslims was rewarded with the granting of a land estate. Similarly, a Kindah rebel named [[Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays]], after repenting and re-joining Islam, was later given land in Medina as well as the hand of Abu Bakr's sister Umm Farwa in marriage. < ref > {{harvtxt|Donner|1981|pages=86\u201387}} < /ref > \n \n At their heart, the Ridda movements were challenges to the political and religious supremacy of the Islamic state. Through his success in suppressing the insurrections, Abu Bakr had in effect continued the political consolidation which had begun under Muhammad's leadership with relatively little interruption. By wars' end, he had established an Islamic hegemony over the entirety of the [[Arabian peninsula]]. < ref > {{harvtxt|Donner|1981|page=86}} < /ref > \n \n ===Expeditions into Persia and Syria=== \n With Arabia having united under a single centralised state with a formidable military, the region could now be viewed as a potential threat to the neighbouring [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sasanian empire]]s. It may be that Abu Bakr, reasoning that it was inevitable that one of these powers would launch a pre-emptive strike against the youthful caliphate, decided that it was better to deliver the first blow himself. Regardless of the caliph's motivations, in 633, small forces were dispatched into [[Iraq]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], capturing several towns. Though the Byzantines and Sassanians were certain to retaliate, Abu Bakr had reason to be confident; the two empires were militarily exhausted after centuries of war against each other, making it likely that any forces sent to Arabia would be diminished and weakened. < ref name=NardoP32 > {{cite book |last=Nardo |first=Don |author-link=Don Nardo |title=The Islamic Empire |publisher=Lucent Books |year=2011 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/islamicempire0000nard/page/30 30], 32 |url=https://archive.org/details/islamicempire0000nard |url-access=registration }} < /ref > \n    \n A more pressing advantage though was the effectiveness of the Muslim fighters as well as their zeal, the latter of which was partially based on their certainty of the righteousness of their cause. Additionally, the general belief among the Muslims was that the community must be defended at all costs. Historian [[Theodor N\u00f6ldeke]] gives the somewhat controversial opinion that this religious fervour was intentionally used to maintain the enthusiasm and momentum of the ''[[ummah]]'': < ref name=NardoP32/ > \n \n {{Quote|It was certainly good policy to turn the recently subdued tribes of the wilderness towards an external aim in which they might at once satisfy their lust for booty on a grand scale, maintain their warlike feeling, and strengthen themselves in their attachment to the new faith\u2026 Muhammad himself had already sent expeditions across the [Byzantine] frontier, and thereby had pointed out the way to his successors. To follow in his footsteps was in accordance with the innermost being of the youthful Islam, already grown great amid the tumult of arms. < ref > {{cite book |last=N\u00f6ldeke |first=Theodore |author-link=Theodor N\u00f6ldeke |title=Sketches from Eastern History |url=https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.21089 |year=1892 |page=[https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.21089/page/n85 73] }} < /ref > }} \n \n Though Abu Bakr had started these initial conflicts which eventually resulted in the Islamic [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquests of Persia]] and [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|the Levant]], he did not live to see any real fighting, instead leaving the task to his successors. < ref name=NardoP32/ > \n \n ===Preservation of the Quran=== \n {{Main|History of the Quran}} \n Abu Bakr was instrumental in preserving the [[Quran]] in written form. It is said that after the hard-won victory over Musaylimah in the [[Battle of Yamama]] in 632, [[Umar]] saw that some five hundred of the Muslims who had [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorised the Quran]] had been killed. Fearing that it may become lost or corrupted, Umar requested that Abu Bakr authorise the compilation and preservation of the scriptures in written format. The caliph was initially hesitant, being quoted as saying   \" how can we do that which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless and keep him, did not himself do? \"  He eventually relented however, and appointed [[Zayd ibn Thabit]], who had previously served as Muhammad's secretary, for the task of gathering the scattered verses. The fragments were recovered from every quarter, including from the ribs of palm branches, scraps of leather, stone tablets and  \" from the hearts of men \" . The collected work was transcribed onto sheets and verified through comparison with Quran memorisers. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Fernhout |first1=Rein |last2=Jansen |first2=Henry |last3=Jansen-Hofland |first3=Lucy |title=Canonical Texts.

He developed a high fever and was confined to bed. His illness was prolonged, and when his condition worsened, he felt that his end was near. Realising this, he sent for [[Ali]] and requested him to perform his [[ghusl]] since Ali had also done it for Muhammad. \n \n Abu Bakr felt that he should nominate his successor so that the issue should not be a cause of dissension among the Muslims after his death, though there was already controversy over Ali not having been appointed. < ref > ''Sidiq-i-Akbar Hazrat Abu Bakr'' by Masudul Hasan. Lahore: Ferozsons, 1976. {{OCLC|3478821}} < /ref >  He appointed Umar for this role after discussing the matter with some companions. Some of them favoured the nomination and others disliked it, due to the tough nature of Umar. \n \n Abu Bakr thus dictated his last testament to [[Uthman ibn Affan]] as follows: \n \n {{Quote|In the name of Most Merciful God. This is the last will and testament of Abu Bakr bin Abu Quhafa, when he is in the last hour of the world, and the first of the next; an hour in which the infidel must believe, the wicked be convinced of their evil ways, I nominate Umar bin al Khattab as my successor. Therefore, hear to him and obey him. If he acts right, confirm his actions. My intentions are good, but I cannot see the future results.

They also consider Abu Bakr as one of [[Hadith of the ten promised paradise|The Ten Promised Paradise]] (''al-\u2018Ashara al-Mubashshara'') whom Muhammad had testified were destined for Paradise. He is regarded as the  \" Successor of Allah's Messenger \"  (''Khalifa Rasulullah''), and first of the Rightly Guided Caliphs \u2013 i.e. [[Rashidun]]\u2014and as the rightful successor to Muhammad. Abu Bakr had always been the closest friend and confidant of Muhammad throughout his life, being beside Muhammad at every major event. It was Abu Bakr's wisdom that Muhammad always honored. Abu Bakr is regarded among the best of Muhammad's followers; as Umar ibn Khattab stated,  \" If the faith of Abu Bakr was weighed against the faith of the people of the earth, the faith of Abu Bakr would outweigh the others. \" < ref > Narrated by al-Bayhaqi in \u2018al-Jamia\u2019 lashu\u2019ab al-Eemaan\u2019 (1:18) and its narrators are trustworthy. < /ref > \n \n ===Shia view=== \n {{See also|Umar at Fatimah's house|Succession to Muhammad}} \n \n The [[Twelver]] [[Shia]] (as the main branch of Shia Islam, with 85% of all Shias) < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/shia-islam-s-holiest-sites.html|title=Shia Islam's Holiest Sites|website=WorldAtlas}} < /ref >  believe that Ali ibn Abi Talib was supposed to assume the [[Caliphate]], and that he had been publicly and unambiguously appointed by Muhammad as his successor at [[Hadith of the pond of Khumm|Ghadir Khumm]].

He refused to accept the testimony of her witnesses, so she claimed the land would still belong to her as inheritance from her deceased father. However, Abu Bakr replied by saying that Muhammad had told him that the prophets of God do not leave as inheritance any worldly possessions and on this basis he refused to give her the lands of Fadak. < ref > [http://www.al-islam.org/fatima-the-gracious-abu-muhammad-ordoni/abu-bakr-versus-fatima-az-zahra-sa al-islam.org], ''Fatima the Gracious'', by Abu \u2013 Muhammad Ordoni, 1987.  Section entitled ''Abu Bakr Versus Fatima az-Zahra (sa)''. < br > See also ''Sahih Al Bukhari'' Volume 5, Book 57, Number 60, which says:  \" Fatima sent somebody to Abu Bakr asking him to give her her inheritance from the Prophet from what Allah had given to His Apostle through Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting). She asked for the Sadaqa (i.e. wealth assigned for charitable purposes) of the Prophet at Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus (i.e., one-fifth) of the Khaibar booty. \"  Abu Bakr said,  \" Allah's Apostle said, 'We (Prophets), our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave is Sadaqa, but Muhammad's Family can eat from this property, i.e. Allah's property, but they have no right to take more than the food they need.' By Allah! I will not bring any change in dealing with the Sadaqa of the Prophet (and will keep them) as they used to be observed in his (i.e. the Prophet's) life-time, and I will dispose with it as Allah's Apostle used to do, \"  Then 'Ali said,  \" I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle, \"  and added,  \" O Abu Bakr! We acknowledge your superiority. \"  Then he (i.e. 'Ali) mentioned their own relationship to Allah's Apostle and their right. Abu Bakr then spoke saying,  \" By Allah in Whose Hands my life is. I love to do good to the relatives of Allah's Apostle rather than to my own relatives \"  Abu Bakr added: Look at Muhammad through his family. \" \n < br > See also ''Sahih Al Bukhari'' Volume 8, Book 80, Number 722, which says:   \" Aisha said, 'When Allah's Apostle died, his wives intended to send 'Uthman to Abu Bakr asking him for their share of the inheritance.' Then  \" Aisha said to them, 'Didn't Allah's Apostle say, Our (Apostles') property is not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be spent in charity?' \" < /ref >  However, as Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy notes in his book ''A Restatement of the History of Islam  &  Muslims'', Muhammad inherited a maid servant, five camels, and ten sheep. This proves that prophets can receive inheritance, and can pass on inheritance to others as well. < ref > {{cite book |last1=Razwy |first1=Ali Asgher |title=A Restatement of the History of Islam  &  Muslims |pages=34\u201335}} < /ref >  In addition, Shias claim that Muhammad had given Fadak to Fatimah during his lifetime, < ref > {{cite book |last1=Jal\u0101l\u012b |first1=\u1e24usayn\u012b |title=Fadak wa l-\u02bfaw\u0101l\u012b |page=141}} < /ref >  and Fadak was therefore a gift to Fatimah, not inheritance.
