Tar is the thick liquid product of the dry distillation and [[pyrolysis]] of organic hydrocarbons primarily sourced from vegetation masses, whether fossilized as with coal, or freshly harvested. The majority of bitumen, on the other hand, was formed naturally when vast quantities of organic animal materials were deposited by water and buried hundreds of metres deep at the [[diagenesis|diagenetic]] point, where the disorganized fatty hydrocarbon molecules joined together in long chains in the absence of oxygen. Bitumen occurs as a solid or highly viscous liquid. It may even be mixed in with coal deposits.

However, since the 1970s, when natural gas succeeded town gas, asphalt has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications.

In 1719, a [[Cree]] named Wa-Pa-Su brought a sample for trade to [[Henry Kelsey]] of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], who was the first recorded European to see it. However, it wasn't until 1787 that fur trader and explorer [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander MacKenzie]] saw the Athabasca oil sands and said,  \" At about 24 miles from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance. \" < ref name=oilsandfacts/ > \n \n The value of the deposit was obvious from the start, but the means of extracting the bitumen was not. The nearest town, [[Fort McMurray, Alberta]], was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the product to pave 600 feet of road in [[Edmonton]], Alberta. Other roads in Alberta were paved with material extracted from oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Dr. Karl A. Clark]] of the [[Alberta Research Council]] patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.canadianpetroleumhalloffame.ca/robert-fitzsimmons.html | title = Robert C.

In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist [[Joseph Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce]] to make the [[View from the Window at Le Gras|oldest surviving photograph from nature]]. The bitumen was thinly coated onto a [[pewter]] plate which was then exposed in a camera. Exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a [[photoresist]] in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes. < ref > [http://www.niepce.org/pagus/pagus-inv.html Ni\u00e9pce Museum history pages.] Retrieved 27 October 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803222723/http://www.niepce.org/pagus/pagus-inv.html |date=3 August 2007 }} < /ref > < ref > [http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/wfp/ The First Photograph (Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin).] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227215421/http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/wfp/ |date=27 December 2009 }} Retrieved 27 October 2012. < /ref > \n \n Bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century. Although widely used for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common diluents, such as linseed oil, varnish and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]]. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s [[Raft of the Medusa]] (1818\u20131819), where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle. < ref name= \" WSJ 2009-08-21 \" > {{cite news |last=Spiegelman |first=Willard |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204119704574236393080650258 |title=Revolutionary Romanticism: 'The Raft of the Medusa' brought energy to French art |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |location=New York City |date=21 August 2009 }} < /ref > \n \n ==Modern use== \n \n ===Global use=== \n The vast majority of refined asphalt is used in construction: primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications. According to the requirements of the end use, asphalt is produced to specification. This is achieved either by refining or blending. It is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year. Approximately 85% of all the asphalt produced is used as the [[Binder (material)|binder]] in asphalt concrete for roads. It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways, car parks and footways. Typically, the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] such as [[sand]], [[gravel]] and crushed rock with asphalt, which acts as the binding agent. Other materials, such as recycled polymers (e.g., [[Natural rubber|rubber]] [[tire|tyres]]), may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended. \n \n A further 10% of global asphalt production is used in roofing applications, where its waterproofing qualities are invaluable. \n The remaining 5% of asphalt is used mainly for sealing and insulating purposes in a variety of building materials, such as pipe coatings, carpet tile backing and paint. Asphalt is applied in the construction and maintenance of many structures, systems, and components, such as the following: \n \n {{div col|colwidth=22em}} \n * Highways \n * Airport runways \n * Footways and pedestrian ways \n * Car parks \n * Racetracks \n * Tennis courts \n * Roofing \n * Damp proofing \n * Dams \n * Reservoir and pool linings \n * Soundproofing \n * Pipe coatings \n * Cable coatings \n * Paints \n * Building water proofing \n * Tile underlying waterproofing \n * Newspaper ink production \n * and many other applications \n {{div col end}} \n \n ===Rolled asphalt concrete=== \n {{Main|Asphalt concrete}}The largest use of asphalt is for making [[asphalt concrete]] for road surfaces; this accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt consumed in the United States.

Slurry seal is a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road.

Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100-ton capacity) [[power shovel]]s and loaded into even larger (400-ton capacity) [[dump trucks]] for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Dr. Karl Clark]] of the [[University of Alberta]] during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a [[Upgrader|bitumen upgrader]] which converts it into a [[light crude oil]] equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional [[oil pipeline]]s and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over {{convert|1|Moilbbl}} per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States. < ref name=NEBstats > {{cite web | url = https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/nrg/sttstc/crdlndptrlmprdct/index-eng.html | title = Crude Oil and Petroleum Products | publisher  = [[National Energy Board]] of Canada | access-date = 21 January 2016}} < /ref > \n \n In Alberta, five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety of other products: The [[Suncor Energy]] upgrader near [[Fort McMurray, Alberta]] produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel fuel; the [[Syncrude Canada]], [[Canadian Natural Resources]], and [[Nexen]] upgraders near Fort McMurray produce synthetic crude oil; and the Shell [[Scotford Upgrader]] near Edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby Shell Oil Refinery. < ref name=CAPP2015 > {{cite web|url=http://www.capp.ca/publications-and-statistics/publications/264673 |title=2015 CAPP Crude Oil Forecast, Markets  &  Transportation |publisher=[[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] |access-date=21 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120081514/http://www.capp.ca/publications-and-statistics/publications/264673 |archive-date=20 January 2016 }} < /ref >  A sixth upgrader, under construction in 2015 near [[Redwater, Alberta]], will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel, with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants. < ref > {{cite web | url = http://www.nwrpartnership.com/ | title = The Project | publisher = North West Redwater Partnership | access-date = 21 January 2016}} < /ref > \n \n ===Non-upgraded crude bitumen=== \n {{See also|Western Canadian Select}} \n Canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as Venezuelan extra-heavy and Mexican [[heavy crude oil|heavy oil]] in chemical composition, and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through [[oil pipeline]]s to the refinery. Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and refined asphalt without any preprocessing. This is particularly common in areas such as the US [[Gulf coast]], where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US [[Midwest]] where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline. < ref name=CAPP2015/ >  By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over {{convert|1.3|Moilbbl}} per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States. < ref name=NEBstats/ > \n \n Because of the difficulty of moving crude bitumen through pipelines, non-upgraded bitumen is usually diluted with [[natural-gas condensate]] in a form called [[dilbit]] or with synthetic crude oil, called [[synbit]]. However, to meet international competition, much non-upgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen, conventional crude oil, synthetic crude oil, and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as [[Western Canadian Select]]. This sour, heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as [[Petroleum industry in Mexico|Mexican Mayan]] or Arabian [[Dubai Crude]]. < ref name=CAPP2015/ > \n \n ===Radioactive waste encapsulation matrix=== \n \n Asphalt was used starting in the 1960s as a [[hydrophobic]] matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble [[sodium nitrate]] and [[sodium sulfate]]) produced by the reprocessing of [[spent nuclear fuel]]s or radioactive [[sludge]]s from sedimentation ponds. < ref > Rodier, J., Scheidhauer, J.,  &  Malabre, M.

One of the main problems is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation because of the presence of [[hydrogen]] gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma [[radiolysis]]. < ref > Johnson, D.I., Hitchon, J.W.,  &  Phillips, D.C.

Journal of nuclear materials, 125(2), 202\u2013218. < /ref >  A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated [[hygroscopic]] salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for [[osmosis|osmotic]] effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a [[Semipermeable membrane|semi-permeable membrane]]. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high [[ionic strength]] of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the [[redox]] conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as [[selenium]], [[technetium]], [[uranium]], [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] have a higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded [[anion]]s. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging. \n \n Different types of asphalt have been used: blown bitumen (partly oxidized with air oxygen at high temperature after distillation, and harder) and direct distillation bitumen (softer). Blown bitumens like Mexphalte, with a high content of saturated hydrocarbons, are more easily biodegraded by microorganisms than direct distillation bitumen, with a low content of saturated hydrocarbons and a high content of aromatic hydrocarbons. < ref > Ait-Langomazino, N., Sellier, R., Jouquet, G.,  &  Trescinski, M.

Other uses include cattle sprays, fence-post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics. Asphalt is used to make [[Japan black]], a [[lacquer]] known especially for its use on iron and steel, and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some exterior paint supply companies to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint or ink, and to make the color darker.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Asphalt is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process. \n \n ==Production== \n [[File:Asphalt plant pic.jpg|thumbnail|right|Typical asphalt plant for making asphalt]] \n About 40,000,000 tons were produced in 1984.{{update inline|date=June 2014}} It is obtained as the  \" heavy \"  (i.e., difficult to distill) fraction. Material with a [[boiling point]] greater than around 500 & nbsp;\u00b0C is considered asphalt. Vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil (such as [[naphtha]], gasoline and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]). The resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications. In a [[de-asphalting unit]], the crude asphalt is treated with either [[propane]] or [[butane]] in a [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] phase to extract the lighter molecules, which are then separated. Further processing is possible by  \" blowing \"  the product: namely reacting it with [[oxygen]]. This step makes the product harder and more viscous. < ref name=UllmannAsph/ > \n \n Asphalt is typically stored and transported at temperatures around {{convert|150|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. Sometimes [[diesel oil]] or [[kerosene]] are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called  \" bitumen feedstock \" , or BFS. Some [[dump truck]]s route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm. The backs of tippers carrying asphalt, as well as some handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is no longer used as a [[release agent]] due to environmental concerns. \n \n ===Oil sands=== \n {{Main|Oil sands}} \n Naturally occurring crude bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from  \" [[oil sands]] \" , currently under development in Alberta, Canada. Canada has most of the world's supply of natural bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres < ref name=oilsands/ >  (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven [[oil reserves]] in the world. The [[Athabasca oil sands]] are the largest bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to [[surface mining]], although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by ''[[in-situ#Petroleum|in situ]]'' methods. Because of [[world oil market chronology from 2003|oil price increases after 2003]], producing bitumen became highly profitable, but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again. By 2014, Canadian crude bitumen production averaged about {{convert|2.3|Moilbbl|m3}} per day and was projected to rise to {{convert|4.4|Moilbbl|m3}} per day by 2020. < ref name= \" CAPP \" / >  The total amount of crude bitumen in Alberta that could be extracted is estimated to be about {{convert|310|Goilbbl|e9m3|sigfig=1}}, < ref name=ST98/ >  which at a rate of {{convert|4400000|oilbbl/d}} would last about 200 years. \n \n ===Alternatives and bioasphalt=== \n {{Main|Peak oil|Global warming|Bioasphalt}} \n Although uncompetitive economically, asphalt can be made from nonpetroleum-based renewable resources such as sugar, [[molasses]] and rice, corn and potato [[starch]]es. Asphalt can also be made from waste material by [[fractional distillation]] of used [[motor oil]], which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills. Use of motor oil may cause premature cracking in colder climates, resulting in roads that need to be repaved more frequently. < ref > {{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/10298436.2010.488729| issn = 1029-8436| volume = 11| issue = 6| pages = 541\u2013553| last = Hesp| first = Simon A.M.|author2=Herbert F.

The bitumen is found in the form of veins, filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction. The bitumen content varies from 83% to 92% (soluble in carbon disulphide), with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point (ring and ball) around 120 & nbsp;\u00b0C. The insoluble matter, consisting mainly of silica ore, ranges from 8% to 17%. \n \n Albanian bitumen extraction has a long history and was practiced in an organized way by the Romans. After centuries of silence, the first mentions of Albanian bitumen appeared only in 1868, when the Frenchman [[Henri Coquand|Coquand]] published the first geological description of the deposits of Albanian bitumen. In 1875, the exploitation rights were granted to the Ottoman government and in 1912, they were transferred to the Italian company Simsa. Since 1945, the mine was exploited by the Albanian government and from 2001 to date, the management passed to a French company, which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the natural bitumen on an industrial scale. < ref > {{cite book|last1=Giavarini|first1=Carlo|title=Six Thousand Years of Asphalt|year=2013|publisher=SITEB|isbn=978-88-908408-3-8|pages=71\u201378}} < /ref > \n \n Today the mine is predominantly exploited in an open pit quarry but several of the many underground mines (deep and extending over several km) still remain viable. Selenizza is produced primarily in granular form, after melting the bitumen pieces selected in the mine. \n \n Selenizza < ref name= \" Selenice Bitumi \" > [http://www.selenicebitumi.com/engindex.php], Selenice Bitumi for more information about Selenizza < /ref >  is mainly used as an additive in the road construction sector. It is mixed with traditional asphalt to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing. It may be blended with the hot asphalt in tanks, but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants. Other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks, bridges, car-parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for the oil and gas industry. Selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in sacks or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags. \n \n A [[life-cycle assessment]] study of the natural selenizza compared with petroleum asphalt has shown that the environmental impact of the selenizza is about half the impact of the road asphalt produced in oil refineries in terms of [[Greenhouse gas emissions|carbon dioxide emission]]. < ref > {{cite journal|last1=Giavarini|first1=C.|last2=Pellegrini|first2=A.|title=Life cycle assessment of Selenice asphalt compared with petroleum bitumen|journal=The 1st Albanian Congress on Roads|pages=234\u2013237}} < /ref > \n \n == Recycling == \n Asphalt is a commonly recycled material in the construction industry.

However, asphalt is, today, a highly traded commodity. Its prices increased substantially in the early 21st Century. A U.S. government report states: \n : \" In 2002, asphalt sold for approximately $160 per ton. By the end of 2006, the cost had doubled to approximately $320 per ton, and then it almost doubled again in 2012 to approximately $610 per ton. \" < ref name= \" whats_in_your_asphalt_2017_09_fhwa \"  / > \n \n The report indicates that an  \" average \"  1-mile (1.6-kilometer)-long, four-lane highway would include  \" 300 tons of asphalt, \"  which,  \" in 2002 would have cost around $48,000.
