The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter. As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta, the temperature can change rapidly. Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from {{convert|-54|C|sigfig=2}} in northern Alberta to {{convert|-46|C|sigfig=2}} in southern Alberta, although temperatures at these extremes are rare. \n \n In the summer, continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from {{convert|32|C}} in the mountains to over {{convert|40|C}} in southeastern Alberta. < ref name= \" climatlas \" > {{cite web|title=Climate of Alberta|work=Agroclimatic Atlas of Alberta|publisher=Government of Alberta|year=2003|url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sag6299|access-date=October 1, 2008}} < /ref >  Alberta is a sunny province. Annual bright sunshine totals range between 1,900 up to just under 2,600 hours per year. Northern Alberta gets about 18 hours of daylight in the summer. < ref name= \" climatlas \" / > \n \n Alberta extends for over {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} from north to south; its climate, therefore, varies considerably. Average high temperatures in January range from {{convert|0|C|sigfig=2}} in the southwest to {{convert|-24|C|sigfig=2}} in the far north. The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest, which disrupt the flow of the [[Westerlies|prevailing westerly winds]] and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province, casting a [[rain shadow]] over much of Alberta. The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Pacific Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean.

The south and central prairie was the land of the [[American bison|bison]], commonly known as buffalo, its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a comeback, living on farms and in parks all over Alberta. \n \n [[Herbivore|Herbivorous]] animals are found throughout the province. [[Moose]], [[mule deer]], [[elk]], and [[white-tailed deer]] are found in the wooded regions, and [[pronghorn]] can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. [[Bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain goat]]s live in the Rocky Mountains. Rabbits, [[porcupine]]s, [[skunk]]s, squirrels and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is home to only one variety of venomous snake, the [[Crotalus viridis|prairie rattlesnake]]. \n \n Alberta is home to many large [[carnivore]]s such as [[grizzly bears]] and [[American black bear|black bears]], which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the [[canidae|canine]] and [[Felidae|feline]] families include [[coyote]]s, [[Gray wolf|wolves]], fox, [[lynx]], [[bobcat]] and [[Cougar|mountain lion]] (cougar). \n \n Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of ducks, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s and [[pelican]]s arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. [[Eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s, owls and [[crow]]s are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other [[Temperate climate|temperate]] regions, is home to [[mosquito]]es, [[fly|flies]], [[wasp]]s, and bees. Rivers and lakes are populated with [[Esox|pike]], [[walleye]], [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]], [[rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Brook trout|speckled]], [[brown trout]], and [[sturgeon]]. [[Bull trout]], native to the province, is Alberta's provincial fish. Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. Frogs and [[salamander]]s are a few of the [[amphibian]]s that make their homes in Alberta. \n \n Alberta is the only province in Canada\u2014as well as one of the few places in the world\u2014that is free of [[brown rat|Norwegian rat]]s. < ref > {{cite web| url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3441?opendocument | title=The History of Rat Control in Alberta| publisher=Alberta Department of Agriculture| access-date=January 11, 2007}} < /ref >  Since the early 1950s, the [[Executive Council of Alberta|Government of Alberta]] has operated a rat-control program, which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail.

Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites. Additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the [[Belly River Group]] and [[St. Mary River Formation]]s of the southwest and the northwestern [[Wapiti Formation]]. The Wapiti Formation contains two ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]'' bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity, however.

The first European explorer of the Athabasca region was [[Peter Pond]], who learned of the [[Methye Portage]], which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of Rupert's Land. Fur traders formed the [[North West Company]] (NWC) of [[Montreal]] to compete with the HBC in 1779. The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory. Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on [[Lac la Biche (Alberta)|Lac la Biche]] in 1778. Roderick Mackenzie built [[Fort Chipewyan]] on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], followed the [[North Saskatchewan River]] to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca.

Since 1905 the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905, as well as to create and regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling). \n \n === Elementary and secondary === \n There are forty-two public school jurisdictions in Alberta, and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions. Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a Catholic electorate, and one ([[St. Albert, Alberta|St. & nbsp;Albert]]) has a [[Protestant]] electorate. In addition, one Protestant separate school district, Glen Avon, survives as a ward of the St. Paul Education Region. The City of Lloydminster straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law. \n \n For many years the provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K\u201312 education. Prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property as a supplementary support for local education. In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards, but not for separate school boards. Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K\u201312 education; the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government. The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K\u201312 education provided by school boards. The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities. \n \n [[State school|Public]] and separate school boards, charter schools, and private schools all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education (Alberta Education). [[Homeschooling|Homeschool]] tutors may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies. Public and separate schools, charter schools, and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education, they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education, and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education. \n \n === Post-secondary === \n {{Main|Higher education in Alberta}} \n [[File:U of A.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Alberta]] in 2005. The institution is the oldest, and largest university in Alberta.]] \n The [[University of Alberta]], located in Edmonton and established in 1908, is Alberta's oldest and largest university. The [[University of Calgary]], once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second-largest university in Alberta. [[Athabasca University]], which focuses on distance learning, and the [[University of Lethbridge]] are located in Athabasca and Lethbridge respectively. \n \n In early September 2009, [[Mount Royal University]] became Calgary's second public university, and in late September 2009, a similar move made [[MacEwan University]] Edmonton's second public university.
