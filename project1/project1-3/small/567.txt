While the term  \" android \"  is used in reference to human-looking robots in general, a robot with a female appearance can also be referred to as a ''[[gynoid]]''. \n \n The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' traces the earliest use (as  \" Androides \" ) to [[Ephraim Chambers]]' 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]],'' in reference to an [[automaton]] that St. [[Albertus Magnus]] allegedly created. < ref name= \" Stableford2006 \" / > < ref > ''OED'' at  \" android \"  citing Ephraim Chambers, ''Cyclop\u00e6dia; or, a universal dictionary of arts and sciences.'' 1728. < /ref >  By the late 1700s  \" androides \" , elaborate mechanical devices resembling humans performing human activities, were displayed in exhibit halls. < ref > {{cite news |title=At the Mechanical Theater |work=[[London Times]] |date=22 December 1795}} < /ref >   \n The term  \" android \"  appears in US patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature human-like toy automatons. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=QhIAAAAAEBAJ & dq=patent:40891%7C|title=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Patent# 40891, ''Toy Automation''|publisher=[[Google Patents]]| access-date = 7 January 2007}} < /ref >  The term ''android'' was used in a more modern sense by the French author [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]] in his work ''[[The Future Eve|Tomorrow's Eve]]'' (1886). < ref name= \" Stableford2006 \" / >  This story features an artificial humanlike robot named Hadaly. As said by the officer in the story,  \" In this age of Realien advancement, who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls. \"  The term made an impact into English [[pulp science fiction]] starting from [[Jack Williamson]]'s ''[[The Cometeers]]'' (1936) and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by [[Edmond Hamilton]]'s [[Captain Future]] (1940\u20131944). < ref name= \" Stableford2006 \" / > \n \n Although [[Karel \u010capek]]'s robots in ''[[R.U.R.|R.U.R.

In some fictional works, the difference between a robot and android is only superficial, with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot-like internal mechanics. < ref name= \" Stableford2006 \" / >  In other stories, authors have used the word  \" android \"  to mean a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation. < ref name= \" Stableford2006 \" / >  Other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between. < ref name= \" Stableford2006 \" / > \n \n Eric G. Wilson, who defines an android as a  \" synthetic human being \" , distinguishes between three types of android, based on their body's composition: \n * the mummy type \u2013  made of  \" dead things \"  or  \" stiff, inanimate, natural material \" , such as mummies, puppets, dolls and statues \n * the golem type \u2013 made from flexible, possibly organic material, including golems and homunculi \n * the automaton type \u2013 made from a mix of dead and living parts, including automatons and robots < ref name= \" Wilson2006 \" / > \n \n Although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: ''[[Simulacrum|simulacra]]'' (devices that exhibit likeness) and ''[[Automata theory|automata]]'' (devices that have independence). \n \n ==Projects== \n Several projects aiming to create androids that look, and, to a certain degree, speak or act like a human being have been launched or are underway. \n \n ===Japan=== \n [[File:Actroid-DER 01.jpg|thumb|DER 01, a Japanese [[actroid]]]]{{Expand section|1=more recent examples and additional citations|section=1|date=October 2018}} \n [[Japanese robotics]] have been leading the field since the 1970s. < ref > {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQqVCgAAQBAJ & pg=PA66|title=Robotics and Mechatronics: Proceedings of the 4th IFToMM International Symposium on Robotics and Mechatronics|first1=Sa\u00efd|last1=Zeghloul|first2=Med Amine|last2=Laribi|first3=Jean-Pierre|last3=Gazeau|author-link3=Jean-Pierre Gazeau|date=21 September 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319223681}} < /ref >  [[Waseda University]] initiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the first android, a full-scale humanoid intelligent robot. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.humanoid.waseda.ac.jp/booklet/kato_2-j.html|title=Humanoid History -WABOT-|website=www.humanoid.waseda.ac.jp}} < /ref > < ref name= \" androidworld.com \" > {{cite web|url=http://www.androidworld.com/prod06.htm|title=Historical Android Projects|work=androidworld.com}} < /ref >  Its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using [[tactile sensor]]s.

In 2006, Kokoro developed a new ''DER 2'' android. The height of the human body part of DER2 is 165 & nbsp;cm. There are 47 mobile points. DER2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body. The  \" air servosystem \"  which Kokoro developed originally is used for the actuator. As a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem, the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise. DER2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder. Outwardly DER2 has a more beautiful proportion. Compared to the previous model, DER2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions. Once programmed, it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice. \n \n The Intelligent Mechatronics Lab, directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi at the [[Tokyo University of Science]], has developed an android head called ''Saya'', which was exhibited at Robodex 2002 in [[Yokohama]], Japan. There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time, which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future. Now Saya is ''working'' at the Science University of Tokyo as a guide. \n \n The [[Waseda University]] (Japan) and [[NTT docomo|NTT Docomo's]] manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape-shifting robot ''WD-2''. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To  \" copy \"  a face, they need only a [[3D scanner]] to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask. \n \n ===Singapore=== \n Prof Nadia Thalmann, a Nanyang Technological University scientist, directed efforts of the Institute for Media Innovation along with the School of Computer Engineering in the development of a social robot, Nadine. Nadine is powered by software similar to Apple's [[Siri]] or Microsoft's [[Cortana (software)|Cortana]]. Nadine may become a personal assistant in offices and homes in future, or she may become a companion for the young and the elderly. \n \n Assoc Prof Gerald Seet from the School of Mechanical  &  Aerospace Engineering and the BeingThere Centre led a three-year R & D development in [[tele-presence robotics]], creating EDGAR. A remote user can control EDGAR with the user's face and expressions displayed on the robot's face in real time. The robot also mimics their upper body movements. \n < ref name= \" singapore_NTU \" > {{cite web|url=http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=fde9bfb6-ee3f-45f0-8c7b-f08bc1a9a179|title=NTU scientists unveil social and telepresence robots|access-date=31 December 2015}} < /ref > \n \n ===South Korea=== \n [[File:Ever-2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[EveR-2]], the first android that has the ability to [[singing|sing]]]] \n \n [[KITECH]] researched and developed [[EveR-1]], an android interpersonal communications model capable of emulating human emotional expression via facial  \" musculature \"  and capable of rudimentary conversation, having a vocabulary of around 400 words.

EveR-1's name derives from the [[Eve|Biblical Eve]], plus the letter ''r'' for ''robot''. EveR-1's advanced computing processing power enables [[speech recognition]] and vocal synthesis, at the same time processing [[lip synchronization]] and visual recognition by 90-degree micro-[[charge-coupled device|CCD]] cameras with [[facial recognition system|face recognition technology]].
