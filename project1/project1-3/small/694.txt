The younger Nazel got his first experience with making music at the radio station his father hosted his talk show on; Nazel used the radio station's equipment to put together [[mixtape]]s that he would sell at school. < ref name=ArabianPrinceSixSeven/ >   Nazel went on to graduate from [[Jun\u00edpero Serra High School (Gardena, California)|Jun\u00edpero Serra High School]] in nearby Gardena. < ref name=justfine > {{cite web|url=https://melmagazine.com/arabian-prince-left-n-w-a-and-he-s-doing-just-fine-b776410bec32|title=Arabian Prince Left N.W.A and He's Doing Just Fine|author=Mike Sager|date=16 January 2016|work=MEL Magazine|access-date=1 November 2017}} < /ref > \n \n ==Music career== \n Nazel took the stage name of DJ Prince and started selling mixtapes at school. While working at a luggage store at the Del Amo Mall, its owner Sam Nassif asked him to DJ a party at a community center. He kept performing there for several weekends and the success persuaded Nassif to invest even more in the place, renaming it  \" The Cave \" , where Nazel would continue to host for over three years and even after his N.W.A. days. Nassif also funded DJ Prince's first record,  \" Strange Life \" .{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} \n \n He changed his stage name when he was 15 years old at the Skateland USA, the same skating venue credited for launching the NWA a few years later, due to a fan's suggestion. He said about his name: < ref > {{cite web|url=https://www.thekindland.com/culture/how-arabian-prince-was-written-straight-outta-compton-1368|title=How Arabian Prince was written  \" Straight Outta Compton \" |author=Jasmin St.Claire|date=3 May 2016|work=Kindland}} < /ref > {{Quote \n |text=''I called myself DJ Prince at first; back in the day, I always used to dress like Prince. That was the thing in the early \u201980s\u200a\u2014\u200aeither you dressed like Prince or you dressed like Michael Jackson. I used to wear the tight parachute pants, and I had the trim moustache, the whole thing. One day I was DJing at a skating rink. I was with [[Egyptian Lover]], that was my boy, still is. This girl comes up to us and asks us our names. And he\u2019s like,  \" I\u2019m Egyptian Lover. \"  And I\u2019m like,  \" I\u2019m DJ Prince. \"  She looks at me and goes,  \" I always see you two together.

He also produced the hit single and album for [[J.J. Fad]],  \" [[Supersonic (J.J. Fad song)|Supersonic]] \" . \n \n In 1986, he was a founding member of [[N.W.A]], but soon after fellow member [[Ice Cube]] came back from the Phoenix Institute of Technology in 1988, Arabian Prince left over royalty and contract disagreements.  \" I started off as a solo artist \" , he said,  \" so I was aware of what a royalty statement was. I knew that when these many records were sold, there is a quarterly statement. When you look at it, you can see how much money was paid and then share it. This was not the case. We were also never paid for touring. \"  [[Eazy-E]], Ice Cube and [[MC Ren]] remained as the main performers, [[DJ Yella]] was the [[turntablist]] and [[Dr. Dre]] was the main producer. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/whatever-happened-to-nwas-posse-2164896|title=Whatever Happened to N.W.A's Posse?|author=Martin Cizmar|work=L.A.

His first album, ''[[Brother Arab]]'', was released in 1989 with the single  \" She's Got A Big Posse \" ; ''[[Where's My Bytches]]'' followed in 1993. \n \n In the mid-2000s, he started releasing music again, with his Professor X project on the Dutch label Clone Records.  \" I could not release the record under Arabian Prince \" , he said,  \" because I already had a single out, so I called myself Professor X on that record. \" < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/music/allshookdown/hey-dj/hey-dj-og-arabian-prince/|title=Hey, DJ: OG Arabian Prince|author=Christina Li}} < /ref >   In 2007 he performed as a DJ on the 2K Sports Holiday Bounce Tour with artists from the [[Stones Throw]] label.
