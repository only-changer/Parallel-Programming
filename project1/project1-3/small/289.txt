He belonged to the [[Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty]].{{sfn|Kane|2014|p=12}} \n \n In 1889, King Milan unexpectedly abdicated and withdrew to private life, proclaiming Alexander king of Serbia under a regency until he should attain his majority at eighteen years of age. His mother became his regent. His parents were second cousins. In 1893, King Alexander, aged sixteen, arbitrarily proclaimed himself of full age, dismissed the [[regent]]s and their government, and took the royal authority into his own hands. His action won popular support, as did his appointment of a radical ministry. In May 1894 King Alexander arbitrarily abolished King Milan's liberal constitution of 1888 and restored the conservative one of 1869. His attitude during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)]] was one of strict [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].{{sfn|Mijatovich|1911}} \n \n In 1894 the young King brought his father, Milan, back to Serbia and, in 1898, appointed him commander-in-chief of the Serbian army. During that time, Milan was regarded as the ''de facto'' ruler of the country.{{sfn|Mijatovich|1911}} \n \n ==Marriage== \n [[File:Aleksandar ob heinrich wassmuth 1894.jpg|thumb|Portrait of King Alexander by {{Interlanguage link|Heinrich Wa\u00dfmuth|de}}, 1894]] \n [[File:AleksandarObrenovic.jpg|thumb|Portrait of King Alexander by [[Vlaho Bukovac]], 1900]] \n In the summer of 1900, King Alexander suddenly announced his engagement to [[Draga Ma\u0161in]], a disreputable widow of an obscure engineer. < ref name= \" auto \" > {{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Christopher |title=The sleepwalkers : how Europe went to war in 1914 |date=2012 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |location=New York, NY |isbn=9780061146664 |page=8}} < /ref >  Alexander had met Draga in 1897 when she was serving as a maid of honor to his mother. Draga was twelve years older than the king, unpopular with Belgrade society, well known for her allegedly numerous sexual liaisons, and widely believed to be infertile. < ref name= \" auto \" / >  Since Alexander was an only child, it was imperative to secure the succession by producing an heir. So intense was the opposition to Ma\u0161in among the political classes that the king found it impossible for a time to recruit suitable candidates into senior posts < ref name= \" auto \" / > \n \n Before making the announcement, Alexander did not consult with his father, who had been on vacation in [[Karlovy Vary]] and making arrangements to secure the hand of [[Germany|German]] Princess [[Prince William of Schaumburg-Lippe#Marriage|Alexandra Karoline zu Schaumburg-Lippe]], sister of [[Charlotte of Schaumburg-Lippe|Queen Charlotte of W\u00fcrttemberg]], for his son, or his [[Prime Minister of Serbia|Prime Minister]] Dr. [[Vladan \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107]], who was visiting the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Universal Exhibition]] in [[Paris]] at the time of the announcement. Both immediately resigned from their respective offices and Alexander had difficulty in forming a new cabinet. Alexander's mother also opposed the marriage and was subsequently banished from the kingdom. \n \n Opposition to the union seemed to subside somewhat for a time upon the publication of congratulations of [[Nicholas II of Russia]] to the king on his engagement, and of his acceptance to act as the principal witness at the wedding. The marriage duly took place in August 1900. Even so, the unpopularity of the union weakened the King's position in the eyes of the army and of the country at large.{{sfn|Mijatovich|1911}} \n \n ==Politics and the constitution== \n [[File:King Alexander I Obrenovi\u0107 of Serbia and Queen Draga, ca. 1900.jpg|thumb|King Alexander and Queen Draga]] \n [[File:Obrenoviceva vila u Smederevu.jpg|thumb|The [[Obrenovi\u0107 Villa]], summer residence of King Alexander in [[Smederevo]]]] \n King Alexander tried to reconcile political parties by unveiling a [[classical liberalism|liberal]] [[constitution]] of his own initiative in 1901, introducing for the first time in the constitutional history of Serbia the system of two chambers (''[[National Assembly of Serbia|skup\u0161tina]]'' and ''[[senate]]''). This reconciled the political parties but did not reconcile the army which, already dissatisfied with the king's marriage, became still more so at the rumors that one of the two unpopular brothers of [[Draga Ma\u0161in|Queen Draga]], Lieutenant Nikodije, was to be proclaimed [[heir presumptive]] to the throne.{{sfn|Mijatovich|1911}} \n \n Alexander's good relations and the country's growing dependence to Austria-Hungary were detested by the Serbian public. < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Batakovi\u0107|first=Du\u0161an|date=2017|title=On Parliamentary Democracy in Serbia 1903\u20131914 Political Parties, Elections, Political Freedoms|journal=Balcanica|volume=XLVIII}} < /ref >  Two million [[Serbs]] lived in Austria-Hungary and one more million lived in Ottoman Empire and there was a lot of migration to Serbia. \n \n Meanwhile, the independence of the senate and of the council of state caused increasing irritation to King Alexander. In March 1903 the King suspended the constitution for half an hour, time enough to publish the decrees dismissing and replacing the old senators and councillors of state. This arbitrary act increased dissatisfaction in the country. \n \n ==Assassination== \n {{main|May Coup (Serbia)}} \n The general impression was that, as much as the senate was packed with men devoted to the royal couple and the government obtained a large majority at the general elections, King Alexander would not hesitate any longer to proclaim Queen Draga's brother as the heir presumptive to the throne.{{sfn|Mijatovich|1911}} In spite of this, it had been agreed with the Serbian Government that [[Prince Mirko of Montenegro]], who was married to [[Natalija Konstantinovi\u0107]], the granddaughter of [[Princess Anka Obrenovi\u0107]], an aunt of King Milan, would be proclaimed heir presumptive in the event that the marriage of King Alexander and Queen Draga was childless. < ref name= \" njeg \" > {{Cite web|last=Leroy |first=Pierre Olivier |url=http://www.njegoskij.org/menu_history/subArts_2006/subArtHI_05006.php#footnotes |title=Biography of Prince Mihajlo Petrovic Njegos |access-date=September 28, 2007 |publisher=The Njegoskij Fund Public Project |year=2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034426/http://www.njegoskij.org/menu_history/subArts_2006/subArtHI_05006.php |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead }} < /ref > \n \n Apparently to prevent Queen Draga's brother being named heir presumptive, but in reality, to replace Alexander Obrenovi\u0107 with [[Peter I of Serbia|Peter Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]], a conspiracy was organized by a group of Army officers headed by Captain [[Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107]] also known as  \" Apis \" , and Novak Peri\u0161i\u0107, a young Serbian Orthodox militant who was in the pay of the [[Russian Empire]], < ref > C. L. Sulzberger, ''The Fall of Eagles'', p.202, Crown Publishers, New York, 1977 < /ref >  as well as the leader of the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]] [[secret society]] which would assassinate [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in 1914. Several politicians were also part of the conspiracy, and allegedly included former Prime Minister, [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]]. < ref name= \" Sulzberger, p.202 \" > Sulzberger, p.202 < /ref >  The royal couple's [[Stari dvor|palace]] was invaded and they hid in a cupboard in the Queen's bedroom. (There is another possibility, used in a Serbian TV history series ''The End of the Obrenovi\u0107 Dynasty'' in which the royal couple was hidden in a secret [[safe room]] hidden behind the mirror in a common bedroom. The room contained an entrance to a secret passage leading out of the palace, but the entrance was inaccessible due to the placement of the queen's wardrobe over it after the wedding.) \n \n The conspirators searched the palace and eventually discovered the royal couple and murdered them in the early morning of June 11, 1903. King Alexander and Queen Draga were shot and their bodies mutilated and disembowelled and, according to eyewitness accounts, thrown from a second-floor window of the palace onto piles of garden manure. < ref name= \" Sulzberger, p.202 \" / >  The King was only 26 years old at the time of his death. King Alexander and Queen Draga were buried in the crypt of [[St. Mark's Church, Belgrade]]. \n \n ==Honours== \n * {{flag|Kingdom of Serbia}}: < ref > {{cite
