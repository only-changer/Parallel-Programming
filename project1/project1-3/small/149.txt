With the fleet reduced to two ships and left without supplies, he was unable to maintain his position for long.

Afonso avoided confrontation, which could have led to civil war, and moved to [[Kochi, India]], to await further instruction from the King, maintaining his own entourage. Increasingly isolated, he wrote to [[Diogo Lopes de Sequeira]], who arrived in India with a new fleet, but was ignored as Sequeira joined Almeida. At the same time, Afonso refused approaches from opponents of Almeida who encouraged him to seize power. < ref > {{cite book|first1=Fern\u00e3o Lopes|last1=de Castanheda|title=Historia do Descobrimento e Conquista da India pelos Portugueses|url=https://archive.org/details/historiadodesco08castgoog|year=1833|publisher=Typographia Rollandiana}} < /ref > \n \n On 3 February 1509, Almeida fought the naval [[Battle of Diu]] against a joint fleet of [[Burji dynasty|Mamluks]], [[Ottomans]], the [[Zamorin]] of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], and the [[Mahmud Begada|Sultan of Gujarat]], regarding it as personal revenge for the death of his son. His victory was decisive: the Ottomans and Mamluks abandoned the Indian Ocean, easing the way for Portuguese rule there for the next century. In August, after a petition from Afonso's former officers with the support of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira claiming him unfit for governance, Afonso was sent in custody to [[St. Angelo Fort]] in [[Kannur|Cannanore]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Stephens|1897|pp=61\u201362}} < /ref > < ref > {{harvnb|Whitewayy|1995|p=126}} < /ref >  There he remained under what he considered to be imprisonment. \n \n ==Governor of Portuguese India, 1509\u20131515== \n Afonso was released after three months' confinement, on the arrival at Cannanore of [[Marshal of Portugal]] [[Fernando Coutinho]] with a large fleet. < ref name=Chisholm / >  Coutinho was the most important Portuguese noble ever to visit India up to that point, and he brought an armada of fifteen ships and 3,000 men sent by the King to defend Afonso's rights, and to take [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]. < ref > Neto, Ricardo Bonalume.

He was succeeded by Duarte de Lemos, but left for Cochin and then for Portugal, leaving his fleet to Afonso. \n \n ===Conquest of Goa, 1510=== \n {{Main|Portuguese Conquest of Goa (1510)}} \n [[File: \" Plan de Goa \" , in Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages,1750.jpg|thumb|Illustration depicts the aftermath of the [[Portuguese conquest of Goa]], from the forces of [[Yusuf Adil Shah]].]] \n \n In January 1510, obeying the orders from the King and aware of the absence of the [[Zamorin]], Afonso advanced on Calicut. The attack was initially successful, but unravelled when Marshal Coutinho, infuriated by Albuquerque's success against Calicut and desiring glory for himself, attacked the Zamorin's palace against Albuquerque's advice, and was ambushed. During the retreat, Afonso was badly wounded and was forced to flee to the ships, barely escaping with his life, while Coutinho was killed. < ref name= \" Foundations \"  / > < ref > {{harvnb|Crowley|2015|pp=248\u2013254}} < /ref > \n \n Soon after the failed attack, Afonso assembled a fleet of 23 ships and 1200 men. Contemporary reports state that he wanted to fight the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate]] fleet in the Red Sea or return to Hormuz. However, he had been informed by [[Timoji]] (a privateer in the service of the Hindu [[Vijayanagara Empire]]) that it would be easier to fight them in [[Goa]], where they had sheltered after the Battle of Diu, < ref name=Shastry > {{harvnb|Shastry|Borges|2000|pp=34\u201336}} < /ref >  and also of the illness of the Sultan [[Yusuf Adil Shah]], and war between the [[Deccan sultanates]]. < ref name=Shastry / >  So he relied on surprise in the capture of Goa from the [[Sultanate of Bijapur]]. \n \n A first assault took place in Goa from 4 March to 20 May 1510. After initial occupation, feeling unable to hold the city given the poor condition of its fortifications, the cooling of Hindu residents' support and insubordination among his ranks following an attack by [[Ismail Adil Shah]], Afonso refused a truce offered by the Sultan and abandoned the city in August. His fleet was scattered, and a palace revolt in Kochi hindered his recovery, so he headed to [[Fort Anjediva]]. New ships arrived from Portugal, which were intended for the nobleman Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos at Malacca, who had been given a rival command of the region. \n \n Three months later, on 25 November Afonso reappeared at Goa with a renovated fleet. Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos was compelled to accompany him with the reinforcements for Malacca < ref name= \" Foundations \"  / >  and about 300 Malabari reinforcements from Cannanore. In less than a day, they took Goa from Ismail Adil Shah and his Ottoman allies, who surrendered on 10 December. It is estimated that 6000 of the 9000 Muslim defenders of the city died, either in the fierce battle in the streets or by drowning while trying to escape. < ref > {{harvnb|Kerr|1824}}{{page needed|date=December 2020}} < /ref >  Afonso regained the support of the Hindu population, although he frustrated the initial expectations of Timoji, who aspired to become governor. Afonso rewarded him by appointing him chief  \" [[Aguazil]] \"  of the city, an administrator and representative of the Hindu and Muslim people, as a knowledgeable interpreter of the local customs. < ref name=Shastry / >  He then made an agreement to lower the yearly tribute. \n [[File:Coining of money for D'Albuquerque at Goa, 1510.jpg|thumb|Coining of money for d'Albuquerque at Goa (1510)]] \n In Goa, Afonso established the first Portuguese [[Mint (coin)|mint]] in the East, after Timoja's merchants had complained of the scarcity of currency, taking it as an opportunity to solidify the territorial conquest. < ref > {{harvnb|De Souza|1990|pp=220\u2013221}} < /ref >  The new [[Portuguese Indian rupia|coin]], based on the existing local coins, showed a cross on the obverse and an [[armillary sphere]] (or  \" esfera \" ), King Manuel's badge, on the reverse.

It urged moving forward with the largest possible fleet to demand their release, and gave details of the fortifications. Afonso showed it to Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos, as an argument to advance in a joint fleet. In April 1511, after fortifying Goa, he gathered a force of about 900 Portuguese, 200 Hindu mercenaries and about eighteen ships. < ref name= \" RICKLEFSp23 \" > {{harvnb|Ricklefs|1991|p=23}} < /ref >  He then sailed to [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] against orders and despite the protest of Diogo Mendes, who claimed command of the expedition. Afonso eventually centralized the Portuguese government in the Indian Ocean. After the Malaccan conquest he wrote a letter to the King to explain his disagreement with Diogo Mendes, suggesting that further divisions could be harmful to the Portuguese in India. < ref name= \" Foundations \"  / >  Under his command was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who had participated in the failed embassy of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1509. \n \n After a false start towards the Red Sea, they sailed to the Strait of Malacca. It was the richest city that the Portuguese tried to take, and a focal point in the trade network where Malay traders met Gujarati, Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Bengali, Persian and Arabic, among others, described by [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] as of invaluable richness. Despite its wealth, it was mostly a wooden-built city, with few masonry buildings but was defended by a mercenary force estimated at 20,000 men and more than 2000 pieces of artillery. Its greatest weakness was the unpopularity of the government of [[Sultan Mahmud Shah]], who favoured Muslims, arousing dissatisfaction amongst other merchants. \n \n Afonso made a bold approach to the city, his ships decorated with banners, firing cannon volleys. He declared himself lord of all the navigation, demanded the Sultan release the prisoners and pay for damages, and demanded consent to build a fortified trading post. The Sultan eventually freed the prisoners, but was unimpressed by the small Portuguese contingent. Afonso then burned some ships at the port and four coastal buildings as a demonstration. The city being divided by the Malacca River, the connecting bridge was a strategic point, so at dawn on 25 July the Portuguese landed and fought a tough battle, facing poisoned arrows, taking the bridge in the evening. After fruitlessly waiting for the Sultan's reaction, they returned to the ships and prepared a [[Junk (ship)|junk]] (offered by Chinese merchants), filling it with men, artillery and sandbags. Commanded by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu]], it sailed upriver at high tide to the bridge. The day after, all had landed. After a fierce fight during which the Sultan appeared with an army of [[war elephant]]s, the defenders were dispersed and the Sultan fled. < ref name= \" Foundations \"  / >  Afonso waited for the reaction of the Sultan. Merchants approached, asking for Portuguese protection. They were given banners to mark their premises, a sign that they would not be looted. On 15 August, the Portuguese attacked again, but the Sultan had fled the city. Under strict orders, they looted the city, but respected the banners. < ref name= \" Bosworth2007 \" > {{harvnb|Bosworth|2007|page=317}} < /ref > \n \n Afonso prepared Malacca's defenses against a Malay counterattack, < ref name= \" RICKLEFSp23 \"  / >  building a fortress, assigning his men to shifts and using stones from the mosque and the cemetery. Despite the delays caused by heat and malaria, it was completed in November 1511, its surviving door now known as  \" [[A Famosa]] \"  ('the famous'). It was possibly then that Afonso had a large stone engraved with the names of the participants in the conquest. To quell disagreements over the order of the names, he had it set facing the wall, with the single inscription ''Lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes'' (Latin for  \" The stone the builders rejected \" , from [[David]]'s prophecy, Psalm 118:22\u201323) on the front. < ref > {{cite book|first1=Afonso|last1=de Albuquerque|title=Commentarios do grande Afonso Dalboquerque: capit\u00e3o geral que foi das Indias Orientaes em tempo do muito poderoso rey D.

Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu then sailed to Amboina whilst Serr\u00e3o sailed towards the Moluccas, but he was shipwrecked near Seram. [[Sultanate of Ternate|Sultan Abu Lais of Ternate]] heard of their stranding, and, seeing a chance to ally himself with a powerful foreign nation, brought them to Ternate in 1512 where they were permitted to build a fort on the island, the ''{{Interlanguage link|Forte de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ternate|pt|vertical-align=sup}}'', built in 1522. \n \n ===Return to Cochin and Goa=== \n [[File:Alfonso de Albuquerque II, governor of India.jpg|thumb|Afonso de Albuquerque as governor of India]] \n Afonso returned from Malacca to Cochin, but could not sail to Goa as it faced a serious revolt headed by the forces of [[Ismael Adil Shah]], the Sultan of [[Adil Shahi dynasty|Bijapur]], commanded by [[Rasul Khan]] and his countrymen. During Afonso's absence from Malacca, Portuguese who opposed the taking of Goa had waived its possession, even writing to the King that it would be best to let it go. Held up by the monsoon and with few forces available, Afonso had to wait for the arrival of reinforcement fleets headed by his nephew D. Garcia de Noronha, and Jorge de Mello Pereira. \n \n While at Cochin, Albuquerque started a school. In a private letter to King Manuel I, he stated that he had found a chest full of books with which to teach the children of married Portuguese settlers (''casados'') and Christian converts, of which there were about a hundred, to read and write. < ref > Afonso de Albuquerque ''Cartas para El-Rei D. Manuel I'' edited by Ant\u00f3nio Bai\u00e3o (1942). Letter of 1 April 1512 < /ref > \n \n On 10 September 1512, Afonso sailed from Cochin to Goa with fourteen ships carrying 1,700 soldiers. Determined to recapture the fortress, he ordered trenches dug and a wall breached. But on the day of the planned final assault, Rasul Khan surrendered. Afonso demanded the fort be handed over with its artillery, ammunition and horses, and the deserters to be given up. Some had joined Rasul Khan when the Portuguese were forced to flee Goa in May 1510, others during the recent siege. Rasul Khan consented, on condition that their lives be spared. Afonso agreed and he left Goa. He did spare the lives of the deserters, but had them horribly mutilated. One such renegade was [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes (soldier)|Fern\u00e3o Lopes]], bound for Portugal in custody, who escaped at the island of Saint Helena and led a 'Robinson Crusoe' life for many years. After such measures the town became the most prosperous Portuguese settlement in India. \n \n ===Campaign in the Red Sea, 1513=== \n In December 1512 an envoy from [[Ethiopia]] arrived at Goa. [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Mateus]] was sent by the regent queen [[Eleni of Ethiopia|Eleni]], following the arrival of the Portuguese from Socotra in 1507, as an ambassador for the king of Portugal in search of a coalition to help face growing Muslim influence. He was received in Goa with great honour by Afonso, as a long-sought  \" [[Prester John]] \"  envoy. His arrival was announced by King Manuel to [[Pope Leo X]] in 1513. Although Mateus faced the distrust of Afonso's rivals, who tried to prove he was some impostor or Muslim spy, Afonso sent him to Portugal. < ref > {{harvnb|Rogers|1962|p=[https://archive.org/details/questforeasternc0000roge/page/n102 1]}} < /ref >  The King is described as having wept with joy at their report. \n \n In February 1513, while Mateus was in Portugal, Afonso sailed to the Red Sea with a force of about 1000 Portuguese and 400 Malabaris. He was under orders to secure that channel for Portugal. Socotra had proved ineffective to control the Red Sea entrance and was abandoned, and Afonso's hint that [[Massawa]] could be a good Portuguese base might have been influenced by Mateus' reports. < ref name= \" Foundations \"  / > \n \n Knowing that the Mamluks were preparing a second fleet at [[Suez]], he wanted to advance before reinforcements arrived in [[Aden]], and accordingly [[Siege of Aden|laid siege to the city]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Newitt|2005|p=87}} < /ref >  Aden was a fortified city, but although he had scaling ladders they broke during the chaotic attack. After half a day of fierce battle Afonso was forced to retreat. He cruised the Red Sea inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], with the first European fleet to have sailed this route. He attempted to reach [[Jeddah]], but the winds were unfavourable and so he sheltered at [[Kamaran]] island in May, until sickness among the men and lack of fresh water forced him to retreat. In August 1513, after a second attempt to reach Aden, he returned to India with no substantial results. In order to destroy the power of [[Egypt]], he wrote to King Manuel of the idea of diverting the course of the [[Nile]] river to render the whole country barren. < ref name=Chisholm / >  He also intended to steal the body of the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]], and hold it for ransom until all Muslims had left the [[Holy Land]]. < ref > {{harvnb|McGregor|2006|page=[https://archive.org/details/militaryhistoryo00andr/page/20 20]}} < /ref > \n \n Although Albuquerque's expedition failed to reach Suez, such an incursion into the Red Sea by a Christian fleet for the first time in history stunned the Muslim world, and panic spread in Cairo. < ref > {{harvnb|Crowley|2015|page=335}} < /ref > \n \n ===Submission of Calicut=== \n [[File:Portuguese fort at Calicut (cropped).jpg|thumb|The Portuguese fort at Calicut]] \n Albuquerque achieved during his term a favourable end to hostilities between the Portuguese and the Zamorin of Calicut, which had lasted since the massacre of the Portuguese in Calicut in 1502. As naval trade faltered and vassals defected, with no foreseeable solutions to the conflict with the Portuguese, the court of the Zamorin fell to in-fighting. The ruling Zamorin was assassinated and replaced by a rival, under the instigation of Albuquerque, permitting peace talks to commence. The Portuguese were allowed to build a fortress in Calicut itself, and acquired rights to obtain as much [[spice trade|pepper and ginger]] as they wished, at stipulated prices, and half the [[customs duties]] of Calicut as yearly tribute. < ref > {{cite book|first1=Elaine|last1=Sanceau|year=1936|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VyYbAAAAIAAJ & q=inauthor%3A%22Elaine%20Sanceau%22|title=Indies Adventure: The Amazing Career of Afonso de Albuquerque, Captain-general and Governor of India (1509\u20131515)|page=227}} < /ref >  Construction of the fortress began immediately, under the supervision of chief architect Tom\u00e1s Fernandes. \n \n ===Administration and diplomacy in Goa, 1514=== \n [[File:D\u00fcrer's Rhinoceros, 1515.jpg|thumb|left|[[D\u00fcrer's Rhinoceros]], [[woodcut]] (1515)]] \n [[File:Codice Casanatense Portuguese Nobleman and Christian Indian.jpg|thumb|Christian maidens of Goa, meeting with a Portuguese nobleman seeking a wife (depicted in the [[C\u00f3dice Casanatense]], circa 1540)]] \n With peace concluded, in 1514 Afonso devoted himself to governing Goa and receiving embassies from Indian governors, strengthening the city and encouraging marriages of Portuguese men and local women. At that time, Portuguese women were barred from traveling overseas in order to maintain discipline among the men on board the ships. In 1511 under a policy which Afonso promulgated, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local women. To promote settlement, the King of Portugal granted freeman status and exemption from Crown taxes to Portuguese men (known as ''casados'', or  \" married men \" ) who ventured overseas and married local women. With Afonso's encouragement, mixed marriages flourished. He appointed local people for positions in the Portuguese administration and did not interfere with local traditions (except  \" [[Sati (practice)|sati]] \" , the practice of immolating widows, which he banned). \n \n In March 1514 King Manuel sent to [[Pope Leo X]] a huge and exotic embassy led by [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]], who toured the streets of Rome in an extravagant procession of animals from the colonies and wealth from the Indies. His reputation reached its peak, laying foundations of the Portuguese Empire in the East. \n \n In early 1514, Afonso sent ambassadors to [[Gujarat Sultanate|Gujarat's Sultan]] [[Muzaffar Shah II]], ruler of [[Cambay]], to seek permission to build a fort on [[Diu, India]]. The mission returned without an agreement, but [[diplomatic gift]]s were exchanged, including an [[D\u00fcrer's Rhinoceros|Indian rhinoceros]], < ref > {{harvnb|Bedini|1997|p=112}} < /ref >  Afonso sent the rhino to King Manuel, making it the first living example of a rhinoceros seen in Europe since the [[Roman Empire]]. < ref > {{harvnb|Crowley|2015|pp=319\u2013320}} < /ref > \n \n ===Conquest of Ormuz and Illness=== \n [[File:Afonso de Albuquerque (with Santiago cloak).jpg|thumb|upright|Afonso de Albuquerque as Governor of India]] \n In 1513, at Cannanore, Afonso was visited by a [[Persia]]n ambassador from Shah [[Ismail I]], who had sent ambassadors to Gujarat, [[Ormuz]] and Bijapur. The [[shah]]'s ambassador to Bijapur invited Afonso to send back an envoy to Persia. Miguel Ferreira was sent via Ormuz to [[Tabriz]], where he had several interviews with the shah about common goals on defeating the Mamluk sultan. \n \n At the same time, Albuquerque decided to conclude the effective conquest of Hormuz. He had learned that after the Portuguese retreat in 1507, a young king was reigning under the influence of a powerful Persian [[vizier]], Reis Hamed, whom the king greatly feared. At Ormuz in March 1515, Afonso met the king and asked the vizier to be present. He then had him immediately stabbed and killed by his entourage, thus  \" freeing \"  the terrified king, so the island in the Persian Gulf yielded to him without resistance and remained a vassal state of the [[Portuguese Empire]].

He organized a new Portuguese navy in Asia, with orders that Afonso (if he was still in India), be made commander-in-chief against the Sultan of Cairo's armies.
