Reported total manpower in 2013 was about 107,000. < ref > International Institute for Strategic Studies, The Military Balance 2013, 493. < /ref > \n \n The FAA is headed by Chief of the General Staff [[Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda]] since 2010, who reports to the Minister of National Defense, currently Salviano de Jesus Sequeira. \n \n ==History== \n The FAA succeeded to the previous [[People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola]] (FAPLA) following the abortive [[Bicesse Accord]] with the [[Armed Forces of the Liberation of Angola]] (FALA), armed wing of the [[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA). As part of the peace agreement, troops from both armies were to be [[demilitarized]] and then integrated. Integration was never completed as UNITA and FALA went back to war in 1992. Later, consequences for FALA personnel in Luanda were harsh with FAPLA veterans persecuting their erstwhile opponents in certain areas and reports of [[vigilantism]]. \n \n == Army == \n [[File:Angolan soldiers training in Russia.png|300px|right|thumb|Angolan Second Lieutenant, First Lieutenant, and Captain training in Russia in August 2015]] \n \n ===General description=== \n The Army (''Ex\u00e9rcito'') is the land component of the FAA. It is organized in six military regions (Cabinda, Luanda, North, Center, East and South), with an infantry division being based in each one. Distributed by the six military regions / infantry divisions, there are 25 motorized infantry brigades, one tank brigade and one engineering brigade. The Army also includes an artillery regiment, the Military Artillery School, the Army Military Academy, an anti-aircraft defense group, a composite land artillery group, a military police regiment, a logistical transportation regiment and a field artillery brigade. The Army further includes the Special Forces Brigade (including Commandos and Special Operations units), but this unit is under the direct command of the General Staff of the FAA. \n \n ===History=== \n On August 1, 1974, a few months after a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] had overthrown the [[Lisbon]] regime and proclaimed its intention of granting independence to Angola, the MPLA announced the formation of FAPLA, which replaced the EPLA. By 1976 FAPLA had been transformed from lightly armed guerrilla units into a national [[army]] capable of sustained field operations. < ref name= \" ReferenceA \" > [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] < /ref > \n \n In 1990\u201391, the Army had ten military regions and an estimated 73+ 'brigades', each with a mean strength of 1,000 and comprising inf, tank, APC, artillery, and AA units as required. < ref > IISS Military Balance 1990 or 1991 < /ref >  The [[Library of Congress]] said in 1990 that '[t]he regular army's 91,500 troops were organized into more than seventy brigades ranging from 750 to 1,200 men each and deployed throughout the ten military regions. Most regions were commanded by lieutenant colonels, with majors as deputy commanders, but some regions were commanded by majors. Each region consisted of one to four provinces, with one or more infantry brigades assigned to it. The brigades were generally dispersed in battalion or smaller unit formations to protect strategic terrain, urban centers, settlements, and critical infrastructure such as bridges and factories. Counterintelligence agents were assigned to all field units to thwart UNITA infiltration. The army's diverse combat capabilities were indicated by its many regular and motorised infantry brigades with organic or attached armor, artillery, and air defense units; two militia infantry brigades; four antiaircraft artillery brigades; ten tank battalions; and six artillery battalions. These forces were concentrated most heavily in places of strategic importance and recurring conflict: the oil-producing [[Cabinda Province]], the area around the capital, and the southern provinces where UNITA and South African forces operated.' \n \n It was reported on May 3, 2007, that the Special Forces Brigade of the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) located at Cabo Ledo region, northern [[Bengo Province]], would host a 29th anniversary celebration for the entire armed forces. The brigade was reportedly formed on May 5, 1978, and under the command at the time of Colonel Paulo Falcao. < ref > [http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/politica/2007/4/18/Army-Special-Forces-Brigade-Celebrate-Years,38c72dcf-fced-44c2-a0c8-cdc9689f0ecd.html Army Special Forces Celebrate Years] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216000916/http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/politica/2007/4/18/Army-Special-Forces-Brigade-Celebrate-Years,38c72dcf-fced-44c2-a0c8-cdc9689f0ecd.html |date=December 16, 2013 }}, May 3, 2007. < /ref > \n \n It was reported in 2011 that the army was by far the largest of the services with about 120,000 men and women. < ref > [http://www.globaldefence.net/streitkraefte-der-welt/afrika/346-angola.html Global Defence.net: Angolan Armed Forces] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909095916/http://www.globaldefence.net/streitkraefte-der-welt/afrika/346-angola.html |date=September 9, 2011 }} retrieved August 21, 2011 (de) < /ref >  The Angolan Army has around 29,000  \" ghost workers \"  who remain enrolled in the ranks of the FAA and therefore receive a salary. < ref > [http://www.radioecclesia.org/index.php?option=com_content & view=article & id=1686:18-anos-das-for-armadas-angolanas & catid=130:sociedade & Itemid=483, R\u00e1dio Ecclesia: 18 anos das For\u00e7as Armadas Angolanas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317104806/http://www.radioecclesia.org/index.php?option=com_content & view=article & id=1686:18-anos-das-for-armadas-angolanas & catid=130:sociedade & Itemid=483, |date=March 17, 2012 }} retrieved August 22, 2011 (pt) < /ref > \n \n As of 2011, the IISS reported the ground forces had 42 armoured/infantry regiments ('detachments/groups - strength varies') and 16 infantry '[[brigade]]s'. < ref > IISS Military Balance 2011, 410. < /ref >  These probably comprised [[infantry]], [[tank]]s, [[Armoured personnel carriers|APC]], [[artillery]], and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AA units]] as required.

The Navy numbers about 1,000 personnel and operates only a handful of small patrol craft and barges. \n \n The Navy has been neglected and ignored as a military arm mainly due to the guerrilla struggle against the Portuguese and the nature of the civil war. From the early 1990s to the present the Angolan Navy has shrunk from around 4,200 personnel to around 1,000, resulting in the loss of skills and expertise needed to maintain equipment. In order to protect Angola's 1 600 & nbsp;km long coastline, the Angolan Navy is undergoing modernisation but is still lacking in many ways.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Portugal has been providing training through its Technical Military Cooperation (CTM) programme. The Navy is requesting procurement of a frigate, three corvettes, three offshore patrol vessel and additional fast patrol boats. \n \n Most of the vessels in the navy's inventory dates back from the 1980s or earlier, and many of its ships are inoperable due to age and lack of maintenance. However the navy acquired new boats from Spain and France in the 1990s. Germany has delivered several [[Fast Attack Craft]] for border protection in 2011. \n \n In September 2014 it was reported that the Angolan Navy would acquire seven [[Maca\u00e9-class patrol vessel]]s from Brazil as part of a Technical Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) covering the production of the vessels as part of Angola's Naval Power Development Programme (Pronaval). < ref name=DWMacae > {{cite news|title=Angolan Navy acquiring seven patrol vessels|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content & view=article & id=36188:angolan-navy-acquiring-seven-patrol-vessels-from-brazil & catid=51:Sea & Itemid=106|access-date=November 14, 2014|agency=defenceWeb|publisher=defenceWeb|date=September 9, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127194227/http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content & view=article & id=36188:angolan-navy-acquiring-seven-patrol-vessels-from-brazil & catid=51:Sea & Itemid=106|archive-date=November 27, 2014|url-status=live}} < /ref >  The military of Angola aims to modernize its naval capability, presumably due to a rise in maritime piracy within the Gulf of Guinea which may have an adverse effect on the country's economy. \n \n The navy's current known inventory includes the following: \n \n * [[Fast attack craft]] \n ** 4 Mandume class craft (Bazan Cormoran type, refurbished in 2009) \n * [[Patrol boat|Patrol Boats]] \n ** 3 18.3m long Patrulheiro patrol boats (refurbished in 2002) < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/print-version/sa-boat-builder-refurbishes-vessels-for-angola-2002-11-22|title=Engineering News - SA boat builder refurbishes vessels for Angola|access-date=December 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129031520/http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/print-version/sa-boat-builder-refurbishes-vessels-for-angola-2002-11-22|archive-date=November 29, 2014|url-status=live}} < /ref > \n ** 5 ARESA PVC-170 \n ** 2 [[Namacurra-class harbour patrol boat]]s \n * Fisheries Patrol Boats \n ** Ngola Kiluange and Nzinga Mbandi (delivered in September and October 2012 from [[Damen Group|Damen Shipyards]])(Operated by Navy personnel under the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries) \n ** 28 metre FRV 2810 (Pensador) (Operated by Navy personnel under the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries) < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content & view=article & id=29331:angola & catid=119:african-militaries & Itemid=255|title=Angola|author=Guy Martin|access-date=December 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026005313/http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content & view=article & id=29331:angola & catid=119:african-militaries & Itemid=255|archive-date=October 26, 2014|url-status=live|date=February 5, 2013}} < /ref > \n * Landing craft \n ** [[LDM-400]] - 1 or 3 (reportedly has serviceability issues) \n * Coastal defense equipment (CRTOC) \n ** [[SS-C1]] Sepal radar system \n \n The navy also has several aircraft for maritime patrol: \n \n {| class= \" wikitable \" \n !

The Angolan special forces follow the general model of the analogous Portuguese special forces, receiving a similar training. \n \n The Commandos and the Special forces are part of the Special Forces Brigade (BRIFE, ''Brigada de For\u00e7as Especiais''), based at Cabo Ledo, in the [[Bengo Province]]. The BRIFE includes two battalions of commandos, a battalion of special operations and sub-units of combat support and service support. The BRIFE also included the Special Actions Group (GAE, ''Grupo de A\u00e7\u00f5es Especiais''), which is presently inactive and that was dedicated to long range reconnaissance, covert and sabotage operations. In the Cabo Ledo base is also installed the Special Forces Training School (EFFE, ''Escola de Forma\u00e7\u00e3o de For\u00e7as Especiais''). Both the BRIFE and the EFFE are directly under the Directorate of Special Forces of the General Staff of the Armed Forces. \n \n The marines (''fuzileiros navais'') constitute the Marines Brigade of the Angolan Navy. The Marines Brigade is not permanently dependent of the Directorate of Special Forces, but can detach their units and elements to be put under the command of that body for the conduction of exercises or real operations. \n \n Since the disbandment of the Angolan Parachute Battalion in 2004, the FAA do not have a specialized paratrooper unit. However, elements of the commandos, special operations and marines are parachute qualified. \n \n == Foreign deployments == \n The FAPLA's main counterinsurgency effort was directed against UNITA in the southeast, and its conventional capabilities were demonstrated principally in the undeclared [[South African Border War]]. < ref name= \" ReferenceA \" / >  The FAPLA first performed its external assistance mission with the dispatch of 1,000 to 1,500 troops to [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]] in 1977 to bolster the socialist regime of President Manuel Pinto da Costa. During the next several years, Angolan forces conducted joint exercises with their counterparts and exchanged technical operational visits. The Angolan expeditionary force was reduced to about 500 in early 1985. \n \n The Angolan Armed Forces were controversially involved in training the armed forces of fellow [[Lusophone]] states [[Cape Verde]] and Guinea-Bissau. In the case of the latter, the [[2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'\u00e9tat]] was cited by the coup leaders as due to Angola's involvement in trying to  \" reform \"  the military in connivance with the civilian leadership. \n \n A small number of FAA personnel are stationed in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Kinshasa) and the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville). A presence during the unrest in [[Ivory Coast]], 2010\u20132011, were not officially confirmed. However, the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', citing ''[[Jeune Afrique]]'', said that among President [[Gbagbo]]'s guards were 92 personnel of President Dos Santos's [[Presidential Guard Unit]]. < ref > [https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/elfenbeinkueste-gbagbos-letzte-trumpfkarte-als-maertyrer-sterben-1628414.html Gbagbos letzte Trumpfkarte: als M\u00e4rtyrer sterben] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222102021/https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/elfenbeinkueste-gbagbos-letzte-trumpfkarte-als-maertyrer-sterben-1628414.html |date=December 22, 2013 }}, April 7, 2011 < /ref >  Angola is basically interested in the participation of the FAA operations of the [[African Union]] and has formed special units for this purpose. \n \n ==References== \n {{Reflist}} \n \n ==Further reading== \n *{{cite journal |year=2008 |title=World Defence Almanac |journal=Military Technology |volume= XXXII |issue= 1 |pages=301\u2013302 |publisher=Monch Publishing Group |location=Bonn, Germany |issn=0722-3226 }} \n *[[Human Rights Watch]], [https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/angola/ Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process], October 1999 \n *Utz Ebertz and Marie M\u00fcller, Legacy of a resource-fueled war: The role of generals in Angola's mining sector, BICC Focus, June 2013 \n *Area Handbook for Angola, August 1967, Angola, A Country Study (1979 and 1991) \n *Rocky Williams,  \" National defence reform and the African Union. \"  [[SIPRI]] Yearbook 2004: 231\u2013249. \n *Weigert, Stephen L.
