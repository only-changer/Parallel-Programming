An important class of alcohols, of which [[methanol]] and [[ethanol]] are the simplest members, includes all compounds for which the general formula is C{{sub|n}}H{{sub|2n+1}}OH. Simple monoalcohols that are the subject of this article include primary (RCH{{sub|2}}OH), secondary (R{{sub|2}}CHOH) and tertiary (R{{sub|3}}COH) alcohols. \n \n The suffix ''-ol'' appears in the [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC chemical name]] of all substances where the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority. When a higher priority group is present in the compound, the prefix ''hydroxy-'' is used in its [[IUPAC]] name. The suffix ''-ol'' in non-IUPAC names (such as [[paracetamol]] or [[cholesterol]]) also typically indicates that the substance is an alcohol. However, many substances that contain hydroxyl functional groups (particularly sugars, such as [[glucose]] and [[sucrose]]) have names which include neither the suffix ''-ol'', nor the prefix ''hydroxy-''.  \n {{TOC limit|3}} \n \n ==History== \n The inflammable nature of the exhalations of wine was already known to ancient natural philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] (384\u2013322 BCE), [[Theophrastus]] (c. 371\u2013287 BCE), and [[Pliny the Elder]] (23/24\u201379 CE). < ref > {{cite book|last1=Berthelot|first1=Marcellin|author1-link=Marcellin Berthelot|last2=Houdas|first2=Octave V.|year=1893|title=La Chimie au Moyen \u00c2ge|volume=Vol. I\u2013III|location=Paris|publisher=Imprimerie nationale}} vol.

Those groups can form [[hydrogen bond]]s to one another and to most other compounds. Owing to the presence of the polar OH alcohols are more water-soluble than simple hydrocarbons. Methanol, ethanol, and propanol are [[miscible]] in water. [[n-Butanol|Butanol]], with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble. \n \n Because of [[hydrogen bonding]], alcohols tend to have higher boiling points than comparable [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[ether]]s. The boiling point of the alcohol ethanol is 78.29 & nbsp;\u00b0C, compared to 69 & nbsp;\u00b0C for the hydrocarbon [[hexane]], and 34.6 & nbsp;\u00b0C for [[diethyl ether]]. \n \n ==Occurrence in nature== \n Simple alcohols are found widely in nature. Ethanol is the most prominent because it is the product of fermentation, a major energy-producing pathway. The other simple alcohols are formed in only trace amounts. More complex alcohols however are pervasive, as manifested in sugars, some amino acids, and fatty acids. \n \n ==Production== \n \n ===Ziegler and oxo processes=== \n In the [[Ziegler process]], linear alcohols are produced from ethylene and [[triethylaluminium]] followed by oxidation and hydrolysis. < ref name= \" Ullmann1 \" / >  An idealized synthesis of [[1-octanol]] is shown: \n \n :Al(C{{sub|2}}H{{sub|5}}){{sub|3}}  +  9 C{{sub|2}}H{{sub|4}}   \u2192  Al(C{{sub|8}}H{{sub|17}}){{sub|3}} \n :Al(C{{sub|8}}H{{sub|17}}){{sub|3}} +  3 O  +  3 H{{sub|2}}O  \u2192  3 HOC{{sub|8}}H{{sub|17}}  +  Al(OH){{sub|3}} \n \n The process generates a range of alcohols that are separated by [[distillation]]. \n \n Many higher alcohols are produced by [[hydroformylation]] of alkenes followed by hydrogenation.

Ethanol, isopropanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butanol are produced by this general method. Two implementations are employed, the direct and indirect methods. The direct method avoids the formation of stable intermediates, typically using acid catalysts. In the indirect method, the alkene is converted to the [[sulfate ester]], which is subsequently hydrolyzed.

This [[metabolism|metabolic]] reaction produces ethanol as a waste product. Thus, human bodies contain some quantity of alcohol endogenously produced by these bacteria.

(Secondary and especially tertiary alkyl halides will give the elimination (alkene) product instead). [[Grignard reagent]]s react with [[carbonyl]] groups to secondary and tertiary alcohols. Related reactions are the [[Barbier reaction]] and the [[Nozaki-Hiyama reaction]]. \n \n ====Reduction==== \n [[Aldehydes]] or [[ketone]]s are [[redox|reduced]] with [[sodium borohydride]] or [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (after an acidic workup). Another reduction by aluminiumisopropylates is the [[Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction]]. [[Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation]] is the asymmetric reduction of \u03b2-keto-esters. \n \n ====Hydrolysis==== \n [[Alkenes]] engage in an acid catalysed [[hydration reaction]] using concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst that gives usually secondary or tertiary alcohols. The [[hydroboration-oxidation]] and [[oxymercuration-reduction]] of alkenes are more reliable in organic synthesis. Alkenes react with NBS and water in [[halohydrin formation reaction]]. [[Amine]]s can be converted to [[diazonium salt]]s, which are then hydrolyzed. \n \n The formation of a secondary alcohol via reduction and hydration is shown: \n \n :[[File:Secondary alcohol formation-diagram.svg|frameless|upright=1.6|Preparation of a secondary alcohol]] \n \n ==Reactions== < !-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] -- > \n \n ===Deprotonation=== \n With a [[pKa|pK{{sub|a}}]] of around 16\u201319, they are, in general, slightly weaker [[acid]]s than [[water (molecule)|water]]. With strong bases such as [[sodium hydride]] or [[sodium]] they form [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s called '''[[alkoxide]]s''', with the general formula [[Alkyl|R]]O < sup > \u2212 < /sup >  [[Metal|M]] < sup > + < /sup > . \n : 2 R-OH + 2 NaH  \u2192 2 R-O < sup > \u2212 < /sup > Na < sup > + < /sup >  + 2 H{{sub|2}} \n : 2 R-OH + 2 Na   \u2192   2 R-O < sup > \u2212 < /sup > Na < sup > + < /sup >  + H{{sub|2}} \n \n The acidity of alcohols is strongly affected by [[solvation]]. In the gas phase, alcohols are more acidic than in water. < ref > {{March6th}} < /ref > \n \n ===Nucleophilic substitution=== \n The OH group is not a good [[leaving group]] in [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions, so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions. However, if the oxygen is first protonated to give R\u2212OH{{sub|2}} < sup > + < /sup > , the leaving group ([[water (molecule)|water]]) is much more stable, and the nucleophilic substitution can take place. For instance, tertiary alcohols react with [[hydrochloric acid]] to produce tertiary [[alkyl halide]]s, where the [[hydroxyl group]] is replaced by a [[chlorine]] atom by [[unimolecular nucleophilic substitution]]. If primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with [[hydrochloric acid]], an activator such as [[zinc chloride]] is needed. In alternative fashion, the conversion may be performed directly using [[thionyl chloride]]. < sup > [1] < /sup > \n \n [[File:Alcohol reaction examples.svg|frameless|upright=3.2|Some simple conversions of alcohols to alkyl chlorides]] \n \n Alcohols may, likewise, be converted to alkyl bromides using [[hydrobromic acid]] or [[phosphorus tribromide]], for example: \n \n : 3 R-OH + PBr{{sub|3}} \u2192 3 RBr + H{{sub|3}}PO{{sub|3}} \n \n In the [[Barton-McCombie deoxygenation]] an alcohol is deoxygenated to an [[alkane]] with [[organotin|tributyltin hydride]] or a [[organoborane|trimethylborane]]-water complex in a [[radical substitution]] reaction. \n \n ===Dehydration=== \n Meanwhile, the oxygen atom has [[lone pair]]s of nonbonded electrons that render it weakly [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] in the presence of strong acids such as [[sulfuric acid]]. For example, with methanol: \n \n [[File:Methanol acid base.svg|frameless|upright=2.25|Acidity  &  basicity of methanol]] \n \n Upon treatment with strong acids, alcohols undergo the E1 [[elimination reaction]] to produce [[alkene]]s. The reaction, in general, obeys [[Zaitsev's Rule]], which states that the most stable (usually the most substituted) alkene is formed. Tertiary alcohols eliminate easily at just above room temperature, but primary alcohols require a higher temperature. \n \n This is a diagram of acid catalysed dehydration of ethanol to produce [[ethylene]]: \n \n [[File:DehydrationOfAlcoholWithH-.png|frameless|upright=2.5]] \n \n A more controlled elimination reaction requires the formation of the [[xanthate ester]]. \n \n ===Protonolysis=== \n Tertiary alcohols react with strong acids to generate carbocations. The reaction is related to their dehydration, e.g. isobutylene from tert-butyl alcohol. A special kind of dehydration reaction involves [[triphenylmethanol]] and especially its amine-substituted derivatives. When treated with acid, these alcohols lose water to give stable carbocations, which are commercial dyes. < ref name=Ull > {{Ullmann's | last1 = Gessner | first1 = Thomas | last2 = Mayer | first2 = Udo | title = Triarylmethane and Diarylmethane Dyes | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a27_179}} < /ref > \n [[image:Kristallviolett Darstellung.svg|thumb|right|322px|Preparation of [[crystal violet]] by protonolysis of the tertiary alcohol.]] \n \n ===Esterification=== \n Alcohol and [[carboxylic acid]]s react in the so-called [[Fischer esterification]]. The reaction usually requires a [[catalyst]], such as concentrated sulfuric acid: \n : R-OH + R'-CO{{sub|2}}H \u2192 R'-CO{{sub|2}}R + H{{sub|2}}O \n Other types of ester are prepared in a similar manner{{snd}} for example, [[tosyl]] (tosylate) esters are made by reaction of the alcohol with p-[[toluenesulfonyl]] chloride in pyridine. \n \n ===Oxidation=== \n {{Main|Alcohol oxidation}} \n Primary alcohols (R-CH{{sub|2}}OH) can be oxidized either to [[aldehyde]]s (R-CHO) or to [[carboxylic acid]]s (R-CO{{sub|2}}H). The oxidation of secondary alcohols (R < sup > 1 < /sup > R < sup > 2 < /sup > CH-OH) normally terminates at the [[ketone]] (R < sup > 1 < /sup > R < sup > 2 < /sup > C=O) stage. Tertiary alcohols (R < sup > 1 < /sup > R < sup > 2 < /sup > R < sup > 3 < /sup > C-OH) are resistant to oxidation. \n \n The direct [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] normally proceeds via the corresponding aldehyde, which is transformed via an ''aldehyde hydrate'' (R-CH(OH){{sub|2}}) by reaction with water before it can be further oxidized to the carboxylic acid. \n \n [[File:Alcohol to aldehyde to acid.png|upright=2.25|thumb|center|Mechanism of [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] via aldehydes and aldehyde hydrates]] \n \n Reagents useful for the transformation of primary alcohols to aldehydes are normally also suitable for the [[oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones]]. These include [[Collins reagent]] and [[Dess-Martin periodinane]]. The direct oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids can be carried out using [[potassium permanganate]] or the [[Jones reagent]]. \n \n ==See also== \n {{div col|colwidth=20em}} \n * [[Enol]] \n * [[Ethanol fuel]] \n * [[Fatty alcohol]] \n * [[Index of alcohol-related articles]] \n * [[List of alcohols]] \n * [[Lucas' reagent|Lucas test]] \n * [[Polyol]] \n * [[Rubbing alcohol]] \n * [[Sugar alcohol]] \n * [[Transesterification]] \n {{div col end}} \n \n ==Notes== \n {{Reflist|30em}} \n \n ==References== \n * {{cite book |title=The World in So Many Words |first=Allan A. |last=Metcalf |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1999 |isbn=0-395-95920-9  < !--|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4O0W5XyQVCYC & pg=PA123 & dq=sash+etymology+arabic & lr= & as_brr=3 & sig=iuzjUzyPphZKCIJLAwJZE7beIEI#PPA123,M1-- > }} \n \n ==External links== \n {{sisterlinks|d=Q156|wikt=alcohol|m=no|mw=no|species=no|voy=alcohol|v=Category:Alcohol|s=Category:Alcohol}} \n \n {{Alcohols|state=collapsed}} \n {{Functional group}} \n {{Poisoning and toxicity}} \n {{Orgchemsuffixes}} \n {{Portal bar|Chemistry|Beer|Wine}} \n {{Authority control}} \n \n [[Category:Alcohol| ]] \n [[Category:Alcohols| ]] \n [[Category:Antiseptics]] \n [[Category:Functional groups]]"
