Webmd.com < /ref > \n \n ==Signs and symptoms== \n People with arachnophobia tend to feel [[anxiety|uneasy]] in any area they believe could harbour spiders or that has visible signs of their presence, such as [[spider web|webs]]. If arachnophobes see a spider, they may not enter the general vicinity until they have overcome the [[panic attack]] that is often associated with their phobia. Some people [[screaming|scream]], [[cry]], have emotional outbursts, experience trouble breathing, [[Perspiration|sweat]] and feel increased heart rates when they come in contact with an area near spiders or their webs. In some extreme cases, even a [[picture]] or a realistic drawing of a spider can [[Trauma trigger|trigger]] intense [[fear]]. \n \n ==Reasons== \n Arachnophobia may be an exaggerated form of an [[instinct]]ive response that helped early humans to survive < ref > {{cite book|author1=Friedenberg, J. |author2=Silverman, G. |title=Cognitive Science: An Introduction to the Study of Mind|publisher=SAGE |year=2005 |isbn=1-4129-2568-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cognitivescience0000frie/page/244 244]\u2013245|url=https://archive.org/details/cognitivescience0000frie|url-access=registration |access-date=2008-10-11}} < /ref >  or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly European societies. < ref > {{cite journal|author=Davey, G.C.L.|title=The  \" Disgusting \"  Spider: The Role of Disease and Illness in the Perpetuation of Fear of Spiders|journal=Society and Animals |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=1994 |pages=17\u201325 |doi=10.1163/156853094X00045}} < /ref > \n \n ===Evolutionary=== \n An evolutionary reason for the phobia remains unresolved. One view, especially held in [[evolutionary psychology]], is that the presence of [[Spider bite|venomous spiders]] led to the evolution of a fear of spiders, or made acquisition of a fear of spiders especially easy. Like all traits, there is variability in the intensity of fear of spiders, and those with more intense fears are classified as phobic. Being relatively small, spiders do not fit the usual criterion for a threat in the [[animal|animal kingdom]] where size is a factor, but they can have medically significant [[Venom (poison)|venom]] and/or cause skin irritation with their [[setae]].  < ref > {{cite journal |last1=Isbister |first1=Geoffrey |last2=White |first2=Julian |title=Clinical consequences of spider bites: recent advances in our understanding |journal=Toxicon |date=April 2004 |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=477-92 |doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2004.02.002 |pmid=15066408 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041010104000546?via%3Dihub#BIB56 |access-date=7 December 2020}} < /ref >  However, a phobia is an irrational fear as opposed to a rational fear. < ref > https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/features/fear-factor-phobias#1 < /ref > \n \n By ensuring that their surroundings were free from spiders, arachnophobes would have had a reduced risk of being bitten in ancestral environments, giving them a slight advantage over non-arachnophobes in terms of survival.

For some communities such as in [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Cambodia]] spiders are included in traditional foods. This suggests arachnophobia may be a cultural, rather than genetic trait. < ref > {{cite journal|url=http://webs.wichita.edu/depttools/depttoolsmemberfiles/psychology/publications/Wagener%20 & %20Zettle%20Paper.pdf |title=Targeting Fear of Spiders With Control-, Acceptance-, and Information-Based Approaches |author1=Wagener, Alexandra L. |author2=Zettle, Robert D. |year=2011 |journal=The Psychological Record |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=77\u201391 |doi=10.1007/BF03395747 |s2cid=44385538 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614031029/http://webs.wichita.edu/depttools/depttoolsmemberfiles/psychology/publications/Wagener%20%26%20Zettle%20Paper.pdf |archive-date=2011-06-14 }} < /ref > < ref > {{cite journal|title=Fears, Phobias, and Preparedness: Toward an Evolved Module of Fear and Fear Learning|url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Ohman2001.pdf|pmid=11488376|year=2001|last1=Ohman|first1=A|last2=Mineka|first2=S|volume=108|issue=3|pages=483\u2013522|journal=Psychological Review|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.483}} < /ref > \n \n ==Treatments== \n The [[fear processing in the brain|fear]] of spiders can be treated by any of the general techniques suggested for [[specific phobia]]s.
