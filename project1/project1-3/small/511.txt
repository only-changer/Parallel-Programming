Any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram. Someone who creates anagrams may be called an  \" anagrammatist \" , < ref > [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anagrammatist Anagrammatist], ''[[Dictionary.com]]''. Retrieved on 12 August 2008. < /ref >  and the goal of a serious or skilled anagrammatist is to produce anagrams that reflect or comment on their subject. \n \n ==Examples== \n Anagrams may be created as a commentary on the subject. They may be a parody, a criticism or satire. For example: \n *  \" [[The New York Times|New York Times]] \"  =  \" [[Infinite monkey theorem|monkeys write]] \" \n *  \" [[Church of Scientology]] \"  =  \" rich-chosen goofy cult \" \n *  \" [[McDonald's]] restaurants \"  =  \" [[Uncle Sam|Uncle Sam's]] standard rot \" \n \n An anagram may also be a synonym of the original word. For example: \n *  \" evil \"  =  \" vile \" \n *  \" a [[gentleman]] \"  =  \" elegant man \" \n *  \" eleven plus two \"  =  \" twelve plus one \" \n \n An anagram that has a meaning opposed to that of the original word or phrase is called an  \" antigram \" . < ref > {{cite dictionary | title=antigram |  dictionary=Definitions.net | url=https://www.definitions.net/definition/antigram | access-date=31 July 2019}} < /ref >  For example: \n *  \" restful \"  =  \" fluster \" \n *  \" [[funeral]] \"  =  \" real fun \" \n *  \" [[adultery]] \"  =  \" true lady \" \n *  \" forty five \"  =  \" over fifty \" \n *  \" [[Santa]] \"  =  \" [[Satan]] \" \n \n They can sometimes change from a proper noun or personal name into an appropriate sentence: \n *  \" [[William Shakespeare]] \"  =  \" I am a weakish speller \" \n *  \" [[Madam Curie]] \"  =  \" Radium came \" \n *  \" [[George W.

Wheatley pg. 72, printed 1862 T.  &  W. Boone, New Bond Street, London < /ref > \n They were popular throughout Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], for example with the poet and composer [[Guillaume de Machaut]]. < ref > [http://www.hoasm.org/IID/Machaut.html Guillaume de Machaut],  \" Here of a Sunday Morning \" , [[WBAI]] < /ref >  They are said to date back at least to the Greek poet [[Lycophron]], in the third century BCE; but this relies on an account of Lycophron given by [[John Tzetzes]] in the 12th century. < ref > {{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lycophron |volume=17 |page=153 }} < /ref > \n \n In the [[Talmud]]ic and [[Midrash]]ic literature, anagrams were used to [[Talmudical hermeneutics|interpret]] the [[Hebrew Bible]], notably by [[Eleazar of Modi'im]]. Later, [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]] took this up with enthusiasm, calling anagrams [[temurah (Kabbalah)|''temurah'']]. < ref > Isaac Broyd\u00e9,  \" Anagram  \"  in ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', 1906 [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1450-anagram full text] < /ref > \n \n Anagrams in [[Latin language|Latin]] were considered witty over many centuries. ''Est vir qui adest'', explained below, was cited as the example in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]''. They became hugely popular in the [[early modern period]], especially in Germany. < ref > {{Cite web | url=https://medium.com/in-medias-res/secrets-of-a-lost-art-part-1-latin-anagrams-aa05739e5400 |title = Secrets of a Lost Art, part 1: Latin Anagrams - in Medias Res|date = 6 May 2018}} < /ref > \n \n Any historical material on anagrams must always be interpreted in terms of the assumptions and spellings that were current for the language in question. In particular, spelling in English only slowly became fixed. There were attempts to regulate anagram formation, an important one in English being that of [[George Puttenham]]'s ''Of the Anagram or Posy Transposed'' in ''The Art of English Poesie'' (1589). \n \n ===Influence of Latin=== \n As a literary game when Latin was the common property of the literate, Latin anagrams were prominent. < ref > {{Cite web | url=https://medium.com/in-medias-res/secrets-of-a-lost-art-part-1-latin-anagrams-aa05739e5400 |title = Secrets of a Lost Art, part 1: Latin Anagrams - in Medias Res|date = 6 May 2018}} < /ref >  Two examples are the change of ''[[Ave Maria]], gratia plena, Dominus tecum'' (Latin: Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord [is] with you) into ''Virgo serena, pia, munda et immaculata'' (Latin: Serene [[virginity of Mary|virgin]], pious, clean and [[immaculate conception|spotless]]), and the anagrammatic answer to [[Pilate]]'s question, ''Quid est veritas?'' (Latin: What is truth?), namely, ''Est vir qui adest'' (Latin: It is the man who is here). The origins of these are not documented. \n \n Latin continued to influence letter values (such as I = J, U = V and W = VV). There was an ongoing tradition of allowing anagrams to be  \" perfect \"  if the letters were all used once, but allowing for these interchanges. This can be seen in a popular Latin anagram against the [[Jesuits]]: ''Societas Jesu'' turned into ''Vitiosa seces'' (Latin: Cut off the wicked things). Puttenham, in the time of [[Elizabeth I]], wished to start from ''Elissabet Anglorum Regina'' (Latin: Elizabeth Queen of the English), to obtain ''Multa regnabis ense gloria'' (Latin: By thy sword shalt thou reign in great renown); he explains carefully that H is  \" a note of [[Aspirated consonant|aspiration]] only and no letter \" , and that Z in [[Zeta|Greek]] or Hebrew is a mere SS. The rules were not completely fixed in the 17th century. [[William Camden]] in his ''Remains'' commented, singling out some letters\u2014[[\u00c6]], K, W, and Z\u2014not found in the classical [[Roman alphabet]]: < ref > Cited in Henry Benjamin Wheatley, ''Of anagrams: a monograph treating of their history'' (1862); [https://archive.org/details/ofanagramsmonogr00wheauoft online text.] < /ref > \n \n {{quote|The precise in this practice strictly observing all the parts of the definition, are only bold with H either in omitting or retaining it, for that it cannot challenge the right of a letter.

The German poet [[Unica Z\u00fcrn]], who made extensive use of anagram techniques, came to regard obsession with anagrams as a  \" dangerous fever \" , because it created isolation of the author. < ref > Friederike Ursula Eigler, Susanne Kord, The Feminist Encyclopedia of German Literature (1997), pp. 14\u20135. < /ref >  The surrealist leader [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] coined the anagram ''Avida Dollars'' for [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], to tarnish his reputation by the implication of commercialism. \n \n ==Applications== \n While anagramming is certainly a recreation first, there are ways in which anagrams are put to use, and these can be more serious, or at least not quite frivolous and formless. For example, psychologists use anagram-oriented tests, often called  \" anagram solution tasks \" , to assess the [[implicit memory]] of young adults and adults alike. < ref name = Java > Java, Rosalind I.  \" Priming and Aging: Evidence of Preserved Memory Function in an Anagram Solution Task. \"  ''The American Journal of Psychology'', Vol. 105, No. 4.

The name  \" [[Voltaire]] \"  of Fran\u00e7ois Marie Arouet fits this pattern, and is allowed to be an anagram of  \" Arouet, l[e] j[eune] \"  (U = V, J = I) that is,  \" Arouet the younger \" .

The [[Jumble]] is a puzzle found in many newspapers in the United States requiring the unscrambling of letters to find the solution. [[Cryptic crossword]] puzzles frequently use anagrammatic clues, usually indicating that they are anagrams by the inclusion of a descriptive term like  \" confused \"  or  \" in disarray \" . An example would be ''Businessman burst into tears (9 letters)''. The solution, ''stationer'', is an anagram of ''into tears'', the letters of which have ''burst'' out of their original arrangement to form the name of a type of ''businessman''. \n \n Numerous other games and contests involve some element of anagram formation as a basic skill. Some examples: \n * In [[Anagrams (game)|Anagrams]], players flip tiles over one at a time and race to take words. They can  \" steal \"  each other's words by rearranging the letters and extending the words. \n * In a version of [[Scrabble]] called [[Clabbers]], the name itself is an anagram of Scrabble. Tiles may be placed in any order on the board as long as they anagram to a valid word. \n * On the British game show ''[[countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'', contestants are given 30 seconds to make the longest word from nine random letters. \n * In [[Boggle]], players make constrained words from a grid of sixteen random letters, by joining adjacent cubes. \n * On the British game show ''[[BrainTeaser]]'', contestants are shown a word broken into randomly arranged segments and must announce the whole word. At the end of the game there is a  \" Pyramid \"  which starts with a three-letter word. A letter appears in the line below to which the player must add the existing letters to find a solution. The pattern continues until the player reaches the final eight-letter anagram. The player wins the game by solving all the anagrams within the allotted time. \n * In [[Bananagrams]], players place tiles from a pool into [[Crossword|crossword-style]] word arrangements in a race to see who can finish the pool of tiles first. \n * Other anagram games include [[Bonza (Word Game)]], [[Bookworm (video game)]], [[Dabble]], [[Letterpress (video game)]], [[Perquackey]], [[Puzzlage]], [[Word Force]], [[WordSpot]], and [[Words with Friends]]. \n \n ===Ciphers=== < !-- This section  heading is linked to in [[Rasterschl\u00fcssel 44]] if you change it, please change it their as well. -- > \n Multiple anagramming is a technique used to solve some kinds of cryptograms, such as a [[permutation cipher]], a [[transposition cipher]], and the [[Jefferson disk]]. < ref > [http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/cryptdict/page55.htm Bletchley Park Cryptographic Dictionary]. Codesandciphers.org.uk. Retrieved on 2014-05-12. < /ref >  Solutions may be computationally found using a [[Jumble algorithm]]. \n \n ==Methods of construction== \n Sometimes, it is possible to  \" see \"  anagrams in words, unaided by tools, though the more letters involved the more difficult this becomes. The difficulty is that for a word of {{mvar|n}} different letters, there are {{math|''n''!}} ([[factorial]] of {{mvar|n}}) different [[permutation]]s and so {{math|''n''!-1}} different anagrams of the word. [[Anagram dictionary|Anagram dictionaries]] can also be used. Computer programs, known as  \" anagram search \" ,  \" anagram servers \" ,  \" anagram solvers \" , offer a much faster route to creating anagrams, and a large number of these programs are available on the Internet such as the [[Anatree]] algorithm. \n \n The [[Computer program|program]] or [[Server (computing)|server]] carries out an exhaustive search of a database of words, to produce a list containing every possible combination of words or phrases from the input word or phrase using a [[jumble algorithm]]. Some programs (such as ''Lexpert'') restrict to one-word answers. Many anagram servers (for example, [http://findwords.online4me.com The Words Oracle]) can control the search results, by excluding or including certain words, limiting the number or length of words in each anagram, or limiting the number of results. Anagram solvers are often banned from online anagram games. The disadvantage of computer anagram solvers, especially when applied to multi-word anagrams, is their poor understanding of the meaning of the words they are manipulating. They usually cannot filter out meaningful or appropriate anagrams from large numbers of nonsensical word combinations. Some servers attempt to improve on this using statistical techniques that try to combine only words that appear together often. This approach provides only limited success since it fails to recognize ironic and humorous combinations. \n \n Some anagrammatists indicate the method they used. Anagrams constructed without the aid of a computer are noted as having been done  \" manually \"  or  \" by hand \" ; those made by utilizing a computer may be noted  \" by machine \"  or  \" by computer \" , or may indicate the name of the computer program (using ''Anagram Genius''). \n \n There are also a few  \" natural \"  instances: English words unconsciously created by switching letters around. The French ''chaise longue'' ( \" long chair \" ) became the American  \" [[chaise longue|chaise lounge]] \"  by [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] (transposition of letters and/or sounds). It has also been speculated that the English  \" curd \"  comes from the Latin ''crudus'' ( \" raw \" ). Similarly, the ancient English word for bird was  \" brid \" . \n \n ==Prominent anagrammatists== \n The French king [[Louis XIII]] had a man named Thomas Billen appointed as his Royal Anagrammatist with an annual salary of 1200 pounds. < ref > {{Cite book|last=Southey|first=Robert|chapter=CLXXIX|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIxUAAAAcAAJ & pg=PA467|title=The Doctor, Etc|publisher=Longman, Greens, and Co.|year=1865|pages=467}} < /ref >  Among contemporary anagrammers, [[Anu Garg]], created an Internet Anagram Server in 1994 together with the satirical anagram-based newspaper ''The Anagram Times''.
