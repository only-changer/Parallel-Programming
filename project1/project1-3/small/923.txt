Small amounts of coal, gas and petroleum have not yet been developed. \n \n Armenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid, [[remittance]]s from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct investment. Economic ties with Russia remain close, especially in the energy sector. \n \n The former government has made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent years, but anti-corruption measures have been more difficult to implement in the period when [[Republican Party of Armenia]] was in power. This is expected to change after the [[2018 Armenian Velvet Revolution|2018 Armenian revolution]]. \n \n ==Overview== \n Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy. Since the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated technology. Armenia is a food importer, and its [[mineral]] deposits ([[gold]] and [[bauxite]]) are small. The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh (which was part of Soviet Azerbaijan) and the breakup of the centrally directed [[economic system]] of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s. Because of political instability and war threat, the Armenian Economy did not have a chance to develop. The problem reached its peak during the second war in Nagorno-Karabakh. The war lasted 44 days, starting from September 27 until November 10, and the result was the worst condition for Armenian Economy. After the war the public debt of Armenia reached to 70% of GDP, making the economy more fragile. \n \n ==Global competitiveness== \n {{See also|Armenia#International_Economy-related_Rankings}} \n \n In the 2020 report of [[Index of Economic Freedom]] by [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]], Armenia is classified as  \" mostly free \"  and ranks 34th, improving by 13 positions and ahead of all other [[Eurasian Economic Union]] countries and many [[EU]] countries including Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Belgium, Spain, France, Portugal and Italy. < ref name= \" economic-index \" > {{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Index/ranking|title=Heritage Index of Economic Freedom|publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720010300/http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking.aspx|archive-date=20 July 2009|access-date=22 July 2009}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.heritage.org/index/country/armenia|title=Armenia Economy: Population, GDP, Inflation, Business, Trade, FDI, Corruption|website=www.heritage.org|language=en|access-date=2019-10-24}} < /ref > \n \n In the 2019 report (data for 2017) of [[Economic Freedom of the World]] published by [[Fraser Institute]] Armenia ranks 27th (classified most free) out of 162 economies. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/economic-freedom-of-the-world-2018-annual-report|title=Economic Freedom of the World: 2018 Annual Report|date=2018-09-25|work=Fraser Institute|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/economic-freedom|title=You are being redirected...|website=www.fraserinstitute.org|access-date=2019-10-24}} < /ref > \n \n In the 2019 report of [[Global Competitiveness Index]] Armenia ranks 69th out of 141 economies. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/how-to-end-a-decade-of-lost-productivity-growth/|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2019|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2019-10-24}} < /ref > \n \n In the 2020 report (data for 2019) of [[Ease of doing business index|Doing Business]] Index Armenia ranks 47th with 10th rank on  \" starting business \"  sub-index. \n \n In the 2019 report (data for 2018) of [[Human Development Index]] by [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] Armenia ranked 81st and is classified into  \" high human development \"  group. \n \n In the 2018 report (data for 2017) of [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] by [[Transparency International]] Armenia ranked 105 of 180 countries. \n \n ==History of the modern Armenian economy== \n At the beginning of the 20th century, the territory of present-day Armenia was an agricultural region with some [[copper]] mining and [[cognac]] production. From 1914 through 1921, Caucasian Armenia suffered from genocide of about 1.5 million Armenian inhabitants  \n on their own homeland which obviously caused total property and financial collapse when all their assets and belongings were forcibly taken away by the Turks the consequences of which after 105 years to this day remain incalculable, revolution, the influx of refugees from Turkish Armenia, disease, hunger and economic misery. About 200,000 people died in 1919 alone. At that point, only American relief efforts saved Armenia from total collapse.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}} Thus, Armenians went from being one of the wealthiest ethnic groups in the region to suffer from poverty and famine. Armenians were the second richest ethnic group in Anatolia after the Greeks, and they were heavily involved in very high productive sectors such as banking, architecture, and trade. < ref > {{Cite journal|url=http://journals.openedition.org/ejts/4411|title=The Taboo within the Taboo: The Fate of \u2018Armenian Capital\u2019 at the End of the Ottoman Empire|first=Bedross Der|last=Matossian|date=October 6, 2011|journal=European Journal of Turkish Studies.

The genocide and then communism were responsible for the loss of many high-quality skills that the Armenians possessed.  \n \n [[File:Trans-100millones-rev.jpg|thumbnail|100 million rubles banknote]] \n \n The first Soviet Armenian government regulated economic activity stringently, nationalizing all economic enterprises, requisitioning [[grain]] from peasants, and suppressing most private market activity. This first experiment of state control ended with the advent of Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) of 1921 & ndash;27. This policy continued state control of the large enterprises and banks, but peasants could market much of their grain, and small businesses could function. In Armenia, the NEP years brought partial recovery from the economic disaster of the post-World War I period. By 1926 agricultural production in Armenia had reached nearly three-quarters of its prewar level.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}} \n \n By the end of the 1920s, Stalin's regime had revoked the NEP and reestablished the state monopoly on all economic activity. Once this occurred, the main goal of the Soviet economic policy in Armenia was to turn a predominantly agrarian and rural republic into an industrial and urban one. Among other restrictions, peasants now were forced to sell nearly all of their output to state procurement agencies rather than at the market. From the 1930s through the 1960s, an industrial infrastructure has been constructed. Besides hydroelectric plants and canals, roads were built and gas pipelines were laid to bring fuel and food from Azerbaijan and Russia.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}} \n \n The Stalinist command economy, in which market forces were suppressed and all orders for production and distribution came from the state authorities, survived in all its essential features until the fall of the Soviet regime in 1991. In the early stages of the communist economic revolution, Armenia underwent a fundamental transformation into a  \" proletarian \"  society. Between 1929 and 1939, the percentage of Armenia's work force categorised as industrial workers grew from 13% to 31%. By 1935 industry supplied 62% of Armenia's economic production. Highly integrated and sheltered within artificial barter economy of the Soviet system from the 1930s until the end of the communist era, the Armenian economy showed few signs of self-sufficiency at any time during that period. In 1988 Armenia produced only 0.9% of the [[net material product]] of the Soviet Union (1.2% of industry, 0.7% of agriculture). The republic retained 1.4% of total state budget revenue, delivered 63.7% of its NMP to other republics, and exported only 1.4% of what it produced to markets outside the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42 & ndash;43}} \n \n [[Agriculture]] accounted for only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. \n \n Armenia's industry was especially dependent on the Soviet military-industrial complex. About 40% of all enterprises in the republic were devoted to defense, and some factories lost 60% to 80% of their business in the last years of the Soviet Union, when massive cuts were made in the national defense expenditures. As the republic's economy faced the prospects of competing in world markets in the mid 1990s, the great liabilities of Armenia's industry were its outdated equipment and infrastructure and the pollution emitted by many of the country's heavy industrial plants.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=43}} \n \n In 1991, Armenia's last year as a Soviet republic, national income fell 12% from the previous year, while per capita gross national product was 4,920 rubles, only 68% of the Soviet average. In large part due to the earthquake of 1988, the Azerbaijani blockade that began in 1989 and the collapse of the international trading system of the Soviet Union, the Armenian economy of the early 1990s remained far below its 1980 production levels. In the first years of independence (1992 & ndash;93), inflation was extremely high, productivity and national income dropped dramatically, and the national budget ran large deficits.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=41}} \n \n ===Post-communist economic reforms=== \n Armenia introduced elements of the free market and privatisation into their economic system in the late 1980s, when [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] began advocating economic reform. Cooperatives were set up in the service sector, particularly in restaurants, although substantial resistance came from the [[Communist Party of Armenia (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Armenia]] (CPA) and other groups that had enjoyed privileged position in the old economy. In the late 1980s, much of Armenia's economy already was opening either semi-officially or illegally, with widespread [[corruption]] and [[bribery]]. The so-called mafia, made up of interconnected groups of powerful officials and their relatives and friends, sabotaged the efforts of reformers to create a lawful market system. When the December 1988 earthquake brought millions of dollars of foreign aid to the devastated regions of Armenia, much of the money went to corrupt and criminal elements.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=48 & ndash;50}} \n \n Beginning in 1991, the democratically elected government pushed vigorously for privatisation and market relations, although its efforts were frustrated by the old ways of doing business in Armenia, the Azerbaijani blockade, and the costs of the [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. In 1992, the Law on the Programme of Privatisation and Decentralisation of Incompletely Constructed Facilities established a state privatisation committee, with members from all political parties. In middle 1993, the committee announced a two-year privatisation programme, whose first stage would be privatisation of 30% of state enterprises, mostly services and light industries. The remaining 70%, including many bankrupt, nonfunctional enterprises, were to be privatised in a later stage with a minimum of government restriction, to encourage private initiative. For all enterprises, the workers would receive 20% of their firm's property free of charge; 30% would be distributed to all citizens by means of vouchers; and the remaining 50% was to be distributed by the government, with preference given to members of the labour organisations. A major problem of this system, however, was the lack of supporting legislation covering foreign investment protection, bankruptcy, monopoly policy, and consumer protection.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}} \n \n In the first post-communist years, efforts to interest foreign investors in joint enterprises were only moderately successful because of the blockade and the energy shortage. Only in late 1993 was a department of foreign investment established in the [[Ministry of Economy (Armenia)|Ministry of Economy]], to spread information about Armenia's investment opportunities and improve the legal infrastructure for investment activity. A specific goal of this agency was creating a market for scientific and technical intellectual property.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}} \n \n A few Armenians living abroad made large-scale investments. Besides a toy factory and construction projects, diaspora Armenians built a cold storage plant (which in its first years had little produce to store) and established the [[American University of Armenia]] in Yerevan to teach the techniques necessary to run a market economy.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}} \n \n Armenia was admitted to the [[International Monetary Fund]] in May 1992 and to the [[World Bank]] in September. A year later, the government complained that those organisations were holding back financial assistance and announced its intention to move toward fuller price liberalisation, and the removal of all [[tariff]]s, quotas, and restrictions of foreign trade. Although privatisation had slowed because of catastrophic collapse of the economy, Prime Minister [[Hrant Bagratyan]] informed the United States officials in the fall of 1993 that plans had been made to embark on a renewed privatisation programme by the end of the year.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50 & ndash;51}} \n \n Like other former states, Armenia's economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally [[planned economy]] and the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns. Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function. In addition, the effects of the [[1988 Spitak earthquake|1988 earthquake]], which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt. Although a cease-fire has held since 1994, the conflict with [[Azerbaijan]] over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] has not been resolved. The consequent blockade along both the Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because of Armenia's dependence on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Azerbaijan and Turkey are closed; routes through Georgia and Iran are adequate and reliable. In 1992\u201393, the GDP had fallen nearly 60% from its 1989 level. The national currency, the [[Armenian dram|dram]], suffered [[hyperinflation]] for the first few years after its introduction in 1993. \n \n Armenia has registered strong economic growth since 1995 and inflation has been negligible for the past several years. New sectors, such as precious stone processing and jewelry making and communication technology (primarily [[Armenia Telephone Company|Armentel]], which is left from the USSR era and is owned by external investors). This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], EBRD, as well as other international financial institutions (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans. Total loans extended to Armenia since 1993 exceed [[USD|$]]800 million. These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the local currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation work in the [[earthquake zone]]. \n \n By 1994, however, the Armenian government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in positive growth rates in 1995\u20132005. Armenia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in January 2003. Armenia also has managed to slash inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. Armenia's unemployment rate, however, remains high, despite strong economic growth. \n \n The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in the early and mid-1990s have been offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at [[Metsamor]]. Armenia is now a net energy exporter, although it does not have sufficient generating capacity to replace [[Armenian Nuclear Power Plant|Metsamor]], which is under international pressure to close. The electricity distribution system was [[privatized]] in 2002. \n \n ==Outperforming GDP growth== \n [[File:GDP growth rates in Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan in 2010 - 2017.png|alt=|thumb|upright 1.2|GDP growth rates in Armenia and some neighboring countries and some regions in years 2010 - 2017]] \n \n According to official preliminary data GDP grew by 7.6 per cent in 2019,  largest recording growth since 2008. < ref name= \" :9 \"  / > < ref name= \" :16 \" > {{Cite web|title=7.6% GDP growth recorded in Armenia in 2019 - Pashinyan|url=http://arka.am/en/news/interview/7_6_gdp_growth_recorded_in_armenia_in_2019_pashinyan_/|website=arka.am|access-date=2020-02-24}} < /ref > \n \n GDP per capita was approximately $4,280 in 2018 and is expected to reach $4604 in 2019. < ref name= \" news.am.2019.11.09 \" > {{Cite web|url=https://news.am/eng/news/480753.html|title=Armenia Finance Ministry: GDP per capita will be $4,600 in 2019|website=news.am|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}} < /ref >  In terms of GDP per capita [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] expects Armenia to surpass neighboring Georgia in 2019 and neighboring Azerbaijan in 2020. < ref name= \" :10 \" > {{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2017 & ey=2024 & scsm=1 & ssd=1 & sort=subject & ds=. & br=1 & pr1.x=45 & pr1.y=8 & c=911,912,915 & s=NGDP_D,NGDPDPC,PPPPC,NGSD_NGDP,PCPI,PCPIPCH,TM_RPCH,TX_RPCH,LP,GGXWDG_NGDP,BCA,BCA_NGDPD & grp=0 & a=|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|website=www.imf.org|access-date=2019-10-21}} < /ref > \n \n With 8.3% Armenia recorded highest degree of GDP growth among [[Eurasian Economic Union]] countries in 2018 January\u2013June against the same period of 2017. < ref > {{Cite news|url=https://armenpress.am/eng/news/956452.html|title=Armenia leads EEU countries on level of economic growth \u2013 official EEC data|work=armenpress.am|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en}} < /ref > \n \n Earlier, the economy of Armenia grew by 7.5% in 2017 and reached a nominal GDP of $11.5 billion per annum, while per capita figure grew by 10.1% and reached $3880. < ref name= \" arka2017gdp \" > {{cite web|title=ARKA 2017 GDP|url=http://arka.am/en/news/economy/armenia_ends_2017_with_7_5_economic_growth_/|access-date=18 January 2017}} < /ref >  With 7.29% Armenia was second best in GDP per capita growth terms in Europe and Central Asia in 2017. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_ & met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd & idim=country:ARM:AZE:GEO & hl=en & dl=en#!ctype=c & strail=false & bcs=d & nselm=s & met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_kd_zg & scale_y=lin & ind_y=false & idim=country:ARM:AZE:GEO:ALB:AND:AUT:BLR:BEL:BIH:BGR:CHI:HRV:CYP:DNK:CZE:EST:FIN:FRO:FRA:DEU:GRC:GRL:HUN:ISL:IRL:IMN:ITA:KAZ:XKX:KGZ:LVA:LIE:LTU:LUX:MKD:MDA:MCO:MNE:NLD:NOR:POL:PRT:ROU:RUS:SMR:SRB:SVK:SVN:ESP:SWE:CHE:TJK:TUR:TKM:UKR:GBR:UZB & ifdim=country:region:ECS & hl=en_US & dl=en & ind=false|title=World Development Indicators - Google Public Data Explorer|website=www.google.com|access-date=2019-04-30}} < /ref > \n \n Armenian GDP PPP (measured in current international dollar) grew total of 316% per capita in the years 2000-2017 becoming 6th best worldwide in these terms. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?end=2017 & locations=AM-RO-GE-CN-EU & start=2000|title=GDP per capita, PPP (current international $) - Armenia, Romania, Georgia, China, European Union  & #124; Data|website=data.worldbank.org}} < /ref > < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://i.redd.it/022odntsae621.png|title=map of GDP PPP 2000-2017 growth rates worldwide (Data by the World Bank)}} < /ref > \n \n GDP grew 40.7% between 2012 and 2018, and key banking indicators like assets and credit exposures almost doubled. < ref name= \" arka2019growth \"  / > \n [[File:GDP Armenia Georgia Azerbaijan 1990 2016.jpg|thumb|upright 1.2|GDP per capita of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia in years 1990\u20132016, World Bank data.]] \n {| class= \" wikitable sortable \" \n |- \n !

This downturn was due to a combination of different causes. The two biggest contributing factors were the Coronavirus pandemic and the [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war|Second Nagorno-Karabakh War.]] In the first half of 2020, the Armenian economy was negatively impacted by the economic restrictions that were implemented in order to combat the Coronavirus pandemic. These restrictions included a stay at home order, an indoor social distancing requirement, and a mask mandate. These restrictions impacted businesses negatively. According to the World Bank, individual consumption dropped by 9% in the first six months of 2020. < ref name= \" Overview \" / >  This drop in consumer consumption was due to the stay at home order that was intended to combat the spread of COVID-19. However, without significant government support to offset lost wages, inflation climbed to over 4% during the 2020 calendar year. < ref name= \" Overview \" / > \n \n Armenia's war of defense against Azerbaijan was ended by the [[2020 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement|November 10th Document]], signed by embattled Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. The document allowed for the subsequent Azeri occupation of much of the Karabakh region. This occupation has led to over one hundred thousand Armenians being forced to leave their homes and businesses behind. Early in the war, the central government mobilized the country. Private businesses were converted into public ones, producing masks and military equipment. Many factories were converted from private-use to public, and this negatively impacted the economic output from the nation. \n \n GDP growth is projected to recoup halfway in 2021 up to 3.4 percent and will increase up to 4.3 percent in 2022. The recovery will be moderate, as the economy is probably not going to get back to pre-COVID yield levels until 2023. Specialists won't authorize extra lockdowns and limitations in 2021. Albeit the speed of vaccinations progressively increases, specialists don't anticipate immunizing the majority of the population until 2022. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Overview|url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/armenia/overview|access-date=2021-05-13|website=World Bank|language=en}} < /ref > \n \n ==Main sectors of economy== \n ===Agricultural sector=== \n {{main|Agriculture in Armenia}} \n \n Armenia produced in 2018: \n \n * 415 thousand tons of [[potato]]; \n * 199 thousand tons of [[vegetable]]; \n * 187 thousand tons of [[wheat]]; \n * 179 thousand tons of [[grape]]; \n * 138 thousand tons of [[tomato]]; \n * 126 thousand tons of [[watermelon]]; \n * 124 thousand tons of [[barley]]; \n * 109 thousand tons of [[apple]]; \n * 104 thousand tons of [[apricot]] (12th largest world producer);; \n * 89 thousand tons of [[cabbage]]; \n * 54 thousand tons of [[sugar beet]]; \n * 52 thousand tons of [[peach]]; \n * 50 thousand tons of [[cucumber]]; \n * 39 thousand tons of [[onion]]; \n \n In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products. < ref > {{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC/|title=FAOSTAT|website=www.fao.org}} < /ref > \n \n [[Image:Armenia - Terrestrial Paradise?.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cornelian cherry|Cornelian cherries]], [[common fig|figs]], [[pear]]s, [[peach]]es and [[apple]]s sold at a market in [[Yerevan]] are among a few of Armenian agricultural products]] \n As of 2010, the [[agricultural sector|agricultural production]] comprises on average 25 percent of Armenia's GDP. < ref name= \" Armenia_in_2010 \" / >  In 2006, the agricultural sector accounted for about 20 percent of Armenia's GDP. < ref name= \" ArmeniaLib-Aug-8-2006 \" > [http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2006/08/218f6eeb-de6f-47e4-970e-dba7583d7d39.asp  \" Kocharian Orders Tax Exemption For Armenian Farmers \" ], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), August 8, 2006. < /ref > \n \n Armenia's agricultural output dropped by 17.9 percent in the period of January\u2013September 2010.

According to economist Eduard Aghajanov, Armenia could have repaid them with low-interest loans from other, presumably Western sources, or with some of its hard currency reserves which then totaled about $450 million. Furthermore, Aghajanov points to the Armenian government's failure to eliminate widespread corruption and mismanagement in the energy sector \u2013 abuses that cost Armenia at least $50 million in losses each year, according to one estimate. < ref name= \" Eurasianet-May-7-03 \" / > \n \n Political observers say that Armenia's economic cooperation with Russia has been one of the least transparent areas of the Armenian government's work. The debt arrangements have been personally negotiated by (then) Defense Minister (and later President) [[Serge Sarkisian]], initially Kocharyan's closest political associate. Other top government officials, including former Prime Minister [[Andranik Markarian]], had little say on the issue. Furthermore, all of the controversial agreements have been announced after Sarkisian's frequent trips to Moscow, without prior public discussion. < ref name= \" Eurasianet-May-7-03 \" / > \n \n Finally, while Armenia is not the only ex-Soviet state that has incurred multi-million-dollar debts to Russia over the past decades, it is the only state to have so far given up such a large share of its economic infrastructure to Russia. For example, pro-Western [[Ukraine]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (both of which owe Russia more than Armenia) have managed to reschedule repayment of their debts. < ref name= \" Eurasianet-May-7-03 \" / > \n \n ==Transportation routes and energy lines== \n {{see also|Transport in Armenia}} \n [[File:Yerevan Zvartnots International.jpg|thumb|Zvartnots International Airport main concourse]] \n \n ===Internal=== \n Since early 2008, Armenia's entire rail network is managed by the Russian state railway under brand [[South Caucasus Railway]]s. < ref name= \" ArmLib-Oct14-2008 \" > [http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/10/6B68C3F8-5DCC-4B9B-81E5-C638FEDE172D.ASP  \" Armenia \u2018Pressing Ahead\u2019 With Iran Rail Link \" ], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), October 14, 2008. < /ref > < ref name= \" ArmLib-Aug13-2008 \" > [http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/08/F3509195-D04E-4187-AA45-23B61ACF430F.asp  \" Armenia Scrambles To Restore Vital Supplies Via Georgia \" ], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), August 18, 2008. < /ref > \n \n ===Through Georgia=== \n Russian natural gas reaches Armenia via a pipeline through Georgia. \n \n The only operational rail link into Armenia is from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. During Soviet times, Armenia's rail network connected to Russia's via Georgia through [[Abkhazia]] along the [[Black Sea]]. However, the rail link between Abkhazia and other Georgian regions has been closed for a number of years, forcing Armenia to receive rail cars laden with cargo only through the relatively expensive rail-ferry services operating between Georgian and other Black Sea ports. < ref name= \" ArmLib-Oct14-2008 \" / > \n \n The Georgian Black Sea ports of [[Batumi]] and [[Poti]] process more than 90 percent of freight shipped to and from landlocked Armenia.

According to International Labor Organization, Armenia has the highest women's unemployment rate in post-Soviet countries, equaling 17.3% for women above 25. If we compare this rate to those of the neighboring countries (Latvia- 8.6%, Georgia- 7.7%, Azerbaijan- 4.8%), we can see that it is very high. In 2017, the National Statistical Service of Armenia stated that more than 60% of officially registered unemployed people in Armenia are women. One of the lecturers of Yerevan State University, Ani Kojoyan, mentioned that even though there is no issue in the legislation that becomes a reason for women's unemployment; however, there are some issues that are not mentioned in the legislation. Some of those issues are the fact that potential employers consider women's marital status, how many children they have, or if they are planning to get pregnant any time soon. Moreover, some women are not allowed to work by their husbands after graduating from higher educational institutions. She mentions that the most crucial problem affecting this phenomenon is the fact women do not stand up for their rights. It is also mentioned that according to various sources, there is an inequality in men's and women's monthly wages. In all the sectors, the average monthly salary of men is much higher than women even with the same years of education. It is stated that eliminating the discrimination between two genders would positively impact the country's economy. Ani Kojoyan mentions that this is a crucial problem for the economy except for being a women's rights violation. Thus, the Armenian government should take care that unemployed women can find jobs and become taxpayers. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Armenia Has Highest Female Unemployment Rate Among Post-Soviet Countries|url=https://www.azatutyun.am/a/29089151.html|access-date=2021-05-13|website=\u00ab\u0531\u0566\u0561\u057f \u0535\u057e\u0580\u0578\u057a\u0561/\u0531\u0566\u0561\u057f\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576\u00bb \u057c\u0561\u0564\u056b\u0578\u056f\u0561\u0575\u0561\u0576|language=hy}} < /ref > \n \n ===Migrant workers=== \n Since gaining independence in 1991, hundreds of thousands of Armenia's residents have gone abroad, mainly to Russia, in search of work. Unemployment has been the major cause of this massive labor emigration. OSCE experts estimate that between 116,000 and 147,000 people left Armenia for economic reasons between 2002 and 2004, with two-thirds of them returning home by February 2005.

The journey itself was extremely dangerous. To pay their way , may departing migrants took out loans failed, the whole family's future was put at a risk. As a consequence, the practice of delaying or refusing to pay part or all of a migrant workers wages has become common. The risks were also heightened by many emigrants failure.
