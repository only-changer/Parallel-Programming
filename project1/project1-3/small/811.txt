  "{{short description|smallest unit of a chemical element}} \n {{Other uses}} \n {{pp-semi-indef|small=yes}} \n {{Use dmy dates|date=September 2020}} \n {{Infobox atom}} \n \n An '''atom''' is the smallest unit of ordinary [[matter]] that forms a [[chemical element]]. Every [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is composed of neutral or [[ionized]] atoms. Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 & nbsp;[[picometer]]s across. They are so small that accurately predicting their behavior using [[classical physics]]\u2014as if they were tennis balls, for example\u2014is not possible due to [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]]. \n \n Every atom is composed of a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and one or more [[electron]]s bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more [[proton]]s and a number of [[neutron]]s. Only the most common variety of [[hydrogen]] has no neutrons. More than 99.94% of an atom's [[mass]] is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive [[electric charge]], the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, then the atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively \u2013 such atoms are called [[ion]]s. \n \n The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the [[electromagnetic force]]. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the [[nuclear force]]. This force is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force that repels the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force. In this case, the nucleus [[Nuclear fission|splits]] and [[nuclear transmutation|leaves behind different elements]]. This is a form of [[nuclear decay]]. \n \n The number of protons in the nucleus is the ''[[atomic number]]'' and it defines to which chemical element the atom belongs. For example, any atom that contains 29 protons is [[copper]]. The number of neutrons defines the [[isotope]] of the element. Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by [[chemical bond]]s to form [[chemical compound]]s such as [[molecule]]s or [[crystal]]s. The ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature. [[Chemistry]] is the discipline that studies these changes. \n \n ==History of atomic theory== \n {{Main|Atomic theory}} \n \n ===In philosophy=== \n {{Main|Atomism}} \n The basic idea that matter is made up of tiny indivisible particles is very old, appearing in many ancient cultures such as [[Greece]] and [[India]]. The word ''atom'' is derived from the ancient Greek word ''atomos'', which means  \" uncuttable \" . This ancient idea was based in philosophical reasoning rather than scientific reasoning, and modern atomic theory is not based on these old concepts. That said, the word  \" atom \"  itself was used throughout the ages by thinkers who suspected that matter was ultimately granular in nature. < ref > {{cite book|last1=Pullman|first1=Bernard|title=The Atom in the History of Human Thought|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-515040-7|pages=31\u201333|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQs5hur-BpgC & q=Leucippus+Democritus+atom & pg=PA56}} < /ref > < ref > [[#refMelsen1952|Melsen (1952).

He noticed that in chemical compounds which contain a particular chemical element, the content of that element in these compounds will differ by ratios of small whole numbers. This pattern suggested to Dalton that each chemical element combines with others by some basic and consistent unit of mass. \n \n For example, there are two types of [[tin oxide (disambiguation)|tin oxide]]: one is a black powder that is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen, and the other is a white powder that is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen. Adjusting these figures, in the black oxide there is about 13.5 & nbsp;g of oxygen for every 100 & nbsp;g of tin, and in the white oxide there is about 27 & nbsp;g of oxygen for every 100 & nbsp;g of tin. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2. In these oxides, for every tin atom there are one or two oxygen atoms respectively ([[tin(II) oxide|SnO]] and [[tin dioxide|SnO < sub > 2 < /sub > ]]). < ref > [[#refDalton1817|Dalton (1817).

''From Atomos to Atom'', p. 137]] < /ref > \n \n As a second example, Dalton considered two [[iron oxide]]s: a black powder which is 78.1% iron and 21.9% oxygen, and a red powder which is 70.4% iron and 29.6% oxygen. Adjusting these figures, in the black oxide there is about 28 & nbsp;g of oxygen for every 100 & nbsp;g of iron, and in the red oxide there is about 42 & nbsp;g of oxygen for every 100 & nbsp;g of iron. 28 and 42 form a ratio of 2:3. In these respective oxides, for every two atoms of iron, there are two or three atoms of oxygen ([[iron(II) oxide|Fe < sub > 2 < /sub > O < sub > 2 < /sub > ]] and [[iron(III) oxide|Fe < sub > 2 < /sub > O < sub > 3 < /sub > ]]).{{efn|Iron(II) oxide's formula is written here as Fe < sub > 2 < /sub > O < sub > 2 < /sub >  rather than the more conventional FeO because this better illustrates the explanation.}} < ref > [[#refDalton1817|Dalton (1817).

Adjusting these figures, in nitrous oxide there is 80 & nbsp;g of oxygen for every 140 & nbsp;g of nitrogen, in nitric oxide there is about 160 & nbsp;g of oxygen for every 140 & nbsp;g of nitrogen, and in nitrogen dioxide there is 320 & nbsp;g of oxygen for every 140 & nbsp;g of nitrogen. 80, 160, and 320 form a ratio of 1:2:4.

''Modern Introductory Physics'', pp. 65-66]] < /ref > \n \n ===Kinetic theory of gases=== \n {{Main|Kinetic theory of gases}} \n In the late 18th century, a number of scientists found that they could better explain the behavior of gases by describing them as collections of sub-microscopic particles and modelling their behavior using [[statistics]] and [[probability]]. Unlike Dalton's atomic theory, the kinetic theory of gases describes not how gases react chemically with each other to form compounds, but how they behave physically: diffusion, viscosity, conductivity, pressure, etc. \n \n ===Brownian motion=== \n In 1827, [[Botany|botanist]] [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] used a microscope to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically, a phenomenon that became known as  \" [[Brownian motion]] \" . This was thought to be caused by water molecules knocking the grains about. In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] proved the reality of these molecules and their motions by producing the first [[statistical physics]] analysis of [[Brownian motion]]. < ref name=adp322_8_549/ > < ref > {{cite book \n |last=Mazo|first=Robert M.|year=2002 \n |title=Brownian Motion: Fluctuations, Dynamics, and Applications \n |url=https://archive.org/details/brownianmotion00mazo|url-access=limited|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-851567-8 \n |oclc=48753074|pages=[https://archive.org/details/brownianmotion00mazo/page/n11 1]\u20137}} \n < /ref > < ref name=lee_hoon1995/ >  French physicist [[Jean Perrin]] used Einstein's work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of molecules, thereby providing physical evidence for the particle nature of matter. < ref name=e31_2_50/ > \n \n ===Discovery of the electron=== \n [[File:Geiger-Marsden experiment expectation and result.svg|thumb|right|The [[Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment]]: < br / >  ''Left:'' Expected results: alpha particles passing through the plum pudding model of the atom with negligible deflection. < br / >  ''Right:'' Observed results: a small portion of the particles were deflected by the concentrated positive charge of the nucleus.]] \n In 1897, [[J. J. Thomson]] discovered that [[cathode ray]]s are not electromagnetic waves but made of particles that are 1,800 times lighter than [[hydrogen]] (the lightest atom). Thomson concluded that these particles came from the atoms within the cathode \u2014 they were ''subatomic'' particles. He called these new particles ''corpuscles'' but they were later renamed ''[[electron]]s''. Thomson also showed that electrons were identical to particles given off by [[Photoelectric effect|photoelectric]] and radioactive materials. < ref name= \" Thomson \" > {{cite journal|last=Thomson|first=J.J.|title=On bodies smaller than atoms|journal=The Popular Science Monthly|pages=323\u2013335|date=August 1901|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3CMDAAAAMBAJ & pg=PA323|access-date=2009-06-21}} < /ref >  It was quickly recognized that electrons are the particles that carry [[electric current]]s in metal wires. Thomson concluded that these electrons emerged from the very atoms of the cathode in his instruments, which meant that atoms are not indivisible as the name ''atomos'' suggests. \n \n ===Discovery of the nucleus=== \n {{main|Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment}} \n [[J. J. Thomson]] thought that the negatively-charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom in a sea of positive charge that was distributed across the whole volume of the atom. < ref > [[#refNavarro2012|Navarro (2012). ''A History of the Electron'', p. 94]] < /ref >  This model is sometimes known as the [[plum pudding model]]. \n \n [[Ernest Rutherford]] and his colleagues [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]] came to have doubts about the Thomson model after they encountered difficulties when they tried to build an instrument to measure the charge-to-mass ratio of [[alpha particles]] (these are positively-charged particles emitted by certain radioactive substances such as [[radium]]). The alpha particles were being scattered by the air in the detection chamber, which made the measurements unreliable.  Thomson had encountered a similar problem in his work on cathode rays, which he solved by creating a near-perfect vacuum in his instruments. Rutherford didn't think he'd run into this same problem because alpha particles are much heavier than electrons. According to Thomson's model of the atom, the positive charge in the atom is not concentrated enough to produce an electric field strong enough to deflect an alpha particle, and the electrons are so lightweight they should be pushed aside effortlessly by the much heavier alpha particles. Yet there was scattering, so Rutherford and his colleagues decided to investigate this scattering carefully. < ref name=Heilbron2003p64-68 > [[#refHeilbron2003|Heilbron (2003). ''Ernest Rutheford and the Explosion of Atoms'', pp. 64-68]] < /ref > \n \n Between 1908 and 1913, Rutheford and his colleagues performed a series of experiments in which they bombarded thin foils of metal with alpha particles. They spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90\u00b0. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is not distributed throughout the atom's volume as Thomson believed, but is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center. Only such an intense concentration of charge could produce an electric field strong enough to deflect the alpha particles as observed. < ref name=Heilbron2003p64-68/ > \n \n ===Discovery of isotopes=== \n While experimenting with the products of [[radioactive decay]], in 1913 [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] [[Frederick Soddy]] discovered that there appeared to be more than one type of atom at each position on the [[periodic table]]. < ref name=npc1921/ >  The term [[isotope]] was coined by [[Margaret Todd (doctor)|Margaret Todd]] as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element. J. J. Thomson created a technique for [[isotope separation]] through his work on [[ionized gas]]es, which subsequently led to the discovery of [[stable isotope]]s. < ref name=prsA_89_1_1913/ > \n \n ===Bohr model=== \n [[File:Bohr atom animation 2.gif|right|thumb|The Bohr model of the atom, with an electron making instantaneous  \" quantum leaps \"  from one orbit to another with gain or loss of energy. This model of electrons in orbits is obsolete.]] \n {{main|Bohr model}} \n In 1913 the physicist [[Niels Bohr]] proposed a model in which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do so in a finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. < ref name=stern20050516/ >  This quantization was used to explain why the electrons' orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see ''[[synchrotron radiation]]'') and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra. < ref name=bohr19221211/ > \n \n Later in the same year [[Henry Moseley]] provided additional experimental evidence in favor of [[Bohr model|Niels Bohr's theory]]. These results refined [[Ernest Rutherford]]'s and [[Antonius van den Broek]]'s model, which proposed that the atom contains in its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] a number of positive [[nuclear charge]]s that is equal to its (atomic) number in the periodic table. Until these experiments, [[atomic number]] was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity. That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today. < ref name= \" Pais \" > {{Cite book|last=Pais|first=Abraham|year=1986|location=New York|title=Inward Bound: Of Matter and Forces in the Physical World|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-851971-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/inwardboundofmat00pais_0/page/228 228\u2013230]|url=https://archive.org/details/inwardboundofmat00pais_0/page/228}} < /ref > \n \n [[Chemical bond]]s between atoms were explained by [[Gilbert Newton Lewis]] in 1916, as the interactions between their constituent electrons. < ref name=jacs38_4_762/ >  As the [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the [[periodic law]], < ref > {{cite book|last=Scerri|first=Eric R.|title=The periodic table: its story and its significance|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-530573-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/periodictableits0000scer/page/205 205\u2013226]|url=https://archive.org/details/periodictableits0000scer/page/205}} < /ref >  in 1919 the American chemist [[Irving Langmuir]] suggested that this could be explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of [[electron shell]]s about the nucleus. < ref name=jacs41_6_868/ > \n \n The Bohr model of the atom was the first complete physical model of the atom. It described the overall structure of the atom, how atoms bond to each other, and predicted the spectral lines of hydrogen. Bohr's model was not perfect and was soon superseded by the more accurate Schr\u00f6dinger model, but it was sufficient to evaporate any remaining doubts that matter is composed of atoms. For chemists, the idea of the atom had been a useful heuristic tool, but physicists had doubts as to whether matter really is made up of atoms as nobody had yet developed a complete physical model of the atom. \n \n ===The Schr\u00f6dinger model=== \n The [[Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment]] of 1922 provided further evidence of the quantum nature of atomic properties. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split in a way correlated with the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or [[spin (physics)|spin]]. As this spin direction is initially random, the beam would be expected to deflect in a random direction. Instead, the beam was split into two directional components, corresponding to the atomic [[spin (physics)|spin]] being oriented up or down with respect to the magnetic field. < ref name=fop17_6_575/ > \n \n In 1925 [[Werner Heisenberg]] published the first consistent mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics ([[matrix mechanics]]). < ref name= \" Pais \" / >  One year earlier, [[Louis de Broglie]] had proposed the [[de Broglie hypothesis]]: that all particles behave like waves to some extent, < ref > {{cite book |title=Introducing Quantum Theory |author1=McEvoy, J.

Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described [[atomic orbital]] zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed. < ref name=brown2007/ > < ref name=harrison2000/ > \n \n ===Discovery of the neutron=== \n The development of the [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy. The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist [[Francis William Aston]] used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The [[atomic mass]] of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the [[whole number rule]]. < ref name=pm39_6_449/ >  The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the [[neutron]], an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the [[proton]], by the physicist [[James Chadwick]] in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus. < ref name=chadwick1935/ > \n \n ===Fission, high-energy physics and condensed matter=== \n In 1938, the German chemist [[Otto Hahn]], a student of Rutherford, directed neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get [[transuranium element]]s. Instead, his chemical experiments showed [[barium]] as a product. < ref name=Bowden/ > < ref name=CHF/ >  A year later, [[Lise Meitner]] and her nephew [[Otto Frisch]] verified that Hahn's result were the first experimental ''nuclear fission''. < ref name=nature143_3615_239/ > < ref name=schroeder/ >  In 1944, Hahn received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. Despite Hahn's efforts, the contributions of Meitner and Frisch were not recognized. < ref name=pt50_9_26/ > \n \n In the 1950s, the development of improved [[particle accelerator]]s and [[particle detector]]s allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies. < ref name=kullander2001/ >  Neutrons and protons were found to be [[hadron]]s, or composites of smaller particles called [[quark]]s. The [[standard model of particle physics]] was developed that so far has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions. < ref name=npp1990/ > \n \n ==Structure== \n ===Subatomic particles=== \n {{Main|Subatomic particle}} \n Though the word ''atom'' originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various [[subatomic particle]]s. The constituent particles of an atom are the [[electron]], the [[proton]] and the [[neutron]]. \n \n The electron is by far the least massive of these particles at {{val|9.11|e=-31|u=kg}}, with a negative [[Electric charge|electrical charge]] and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques. < ref > {{cite book|last=Demtr\u00f6der|first=Wolfgang|year=2002|title=Atoms, Molecules and Photons: An Introduction to Atomic- Molecular- and Quantum Physics|url=https://archive.org/details/atomsmoleculesph00demt_277|url-access=limited|publisher=Springer|edition=1st|isbn=978-3-540-20631-6|oclc=181435713|pages=[https://archive.org/details/atomsmoleculesph00demt_277/page/n51 39]\u201342}} < /ref >  It was the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured, until the discovery of [[neutrino]] mass. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges.

Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to [[J.J.

Protons are composed of two [[up quark]]s (each with charge +{{sfrac|2|3}}) and one [[down quark]] (with a charge of \u2212{{sfrac|1|3}}). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks.

As a result, atoms with matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay, but with increasing atomic number, the mutual repulsion of the protons requires an increasing proportion of neutrons to maintain the stability of the nucleus. < ref name= \" raymond \" / > \n \n [[File:Wpdms physics proton proton chain 1.svg|right|thumb|upright|Illustration of a nuclear fusion process that forms a deuterium nucleus, consisting of a proton and a neutron, from two protons.

[[Nuclear fusion]] occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3 to 10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion\u2014the [[coulomb barrier]]\u2014and fuse together into a single nucleus. < ref name=mihos2002/ >  [[Nuclear fission]] is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei\u2014usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element. < ref name=lbnl20070330/ > < ref name=makhijani_saleska2001/ > \n \n If the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a [[gamma ray]], or the kinetic energy of a [[beta particle]]), as described by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[mass-energy equivalence]] formula,  < math > E=mc^2 < /math > , where  < math > m < /math >  is the mass loss and  < math > c < /math >  is the [[speed of light]].

This force binds the electrons inside an [[electrostatic]] [[potential well]] surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations. \n \n Electrons, like other particles, have properties of both a [[Wave-particle duality|particle and a wave]]. The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional [[standing wave]]\u2014a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus. This behavior is defined by an [[atomic orbital]], a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured. < ref name=science157_3784_13/ >  Only a discrete (or [[wikt:quantize|quantized]]) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form. < ref name=Brucat2008/ >  Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures, and differ from each other in size, shape and orientation. < ref name=manthey2001/ > \n \n [[File:Atomic-orbital-clouds spdf m0.png|thumb|upright=1.5|3D views of some [[Hydrogen-like atom|hydrogen-like]] atomic orbitals showing probability density and phase ('''g''' orbitals and higher are not shown)]] \n \n Each atomic orbital corresponds to a particular [[energy level]] of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a [[photon]] with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through [[spontaneous emission]], an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for [[atomic spectral line]]s. < ref name=Brucat2008/ > \n \n The amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron\u2014the [[electron binding energy]]\u2014is far less than the [[binding energy|binding energy of nucleons]].

These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the [[Nuclear shell model|shell model]] of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide.

The total number of these particles (called  \" nucleons \" ) in a given atom is called the [[mass number]]. It is a positive integer and dimensionless (instead of having dimension of mass), because it expresses a count. An example of use of a mass number is  \" carbon-12, \"  which has 12 nucleons (six protons and six neutrons). \n \n The actual [[Invariant mass|mass of an atom at rest]] is often expressed in [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]s (Da), also called the unified atomic mass unit (u). This unit is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of [[carbon-12]], which is approximately {{val|1.66|e=-27|u=kg}}. < ref name=iupac/ >  [[hydrogen atom|Hydrogen-1]] (the lightest isotope of hydrogen which is also the nuclide with the lowest mass) has an atomic weight of 1.007825 & nbsp;Da. < ref name=chieh2001/ >  The value of this number is called the [[atomic mass]]. A given atom has an atomic mass approximately equal (within 1%) to its mass number times the atomic mass unit (for example the mass of a nitrogen-14 is roughly 14 & nbsp;Da), but this number will not be exactly an integer except (by definition) in the case of carbon-12. < ref name=nist_wc/ >  The heaviest [[stable atom]] is lead-208, < ref name=s131/ >  with a mass of {{val|207.9766521|u=Da}}. < ref name=audi2003/ > \n \n As even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly, chemists instead use the unit of [[Mole (unit)|moles]]. One mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms (about [[Avogadro constant|{{val|6.022|e=23}}]]). This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1 & nbsp;u, a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram. Because of the definition of the [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass unit]], each carbon-12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly 12 & nbsp;Da, and so a mole of carbon-12 atoms weighs exactly 0.012 & nbsp;kg. < ref name=iupac > {{cite book \n |last=Mills \n |first=Ian \n |author2=Cvita\u0161, Tomislav \n |author3=Homann, Klaus \n |author4=Kallay, Nikola \n |author5=Kuchitsu, Kozo \n |title=Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry \n |publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]], Commission on Physiochemical Symbols Terminology and Units, Blackwell Scientific Publications \n |location=Oxford \n |edition=2nd \n |year=1993 \n |isbn=978-0-632-03583-0 \n |oclc=27011505 \n |url=https://archive.org/details/quantitiesunitss0000unse/page/70 \n |page=[https://archive.org/details/quantitiesunitss0000unse/page/70 70] \n }} < /ref > \n \n ===Shape and size=== \n {{Main|Atomic radius}} \n Atoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an [[atomic radius]].

The result of the emission is a new element with a lower [[atomic number]]. \n * [[Beta decay]] (and [[electron capture]]): these processes are regulated by the [[weak force]], and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an [[antineutrino]], while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a [[positron]] and a [[neutrino]]. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron. \n * [[Gamma decay]]: this process results from a change in the energy level of the nucleus to a lower state, resulting in the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The excited state of a nucleus which results in gamma emission usually occurs following the emission of an alpha or a beta particle. Thus, gamma decay usually follows alpha or beta decay. \n \n Other more rare types of [[radioactive decay]] include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of [[nucleon]]s from a nucleus, or more than one [[beta particle]]. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is [[internal conversion]]\u2014a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous [[nuclear fission]]. \n \n Each [[radioactive isotope]] has a characteristic decay time period\u2014the [[half-life]]\u2014that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an [[exponential decay]] process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth. < ref name=splung/ > \n \n ===Magnetic moment=== \n {{Main|Electron magnetic moment|Nuclear magnetic moment}} \n \n Elementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. This is analogous to the [[angular momentum]] of an object that is spinning around its [[center of mass]], although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating. Spin is measured in units of the reduced [[Planck constant]] (\u0127), with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin \u00bd & nbsp;\u0127, or  \" spin-\u00bd \" . In an atom, electrons in motion around the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] possess orbital [[angular momentum]] in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin. < ref name=hornak2006/ > \n \n The [[magnetic field]] produced by an atom\u2014its [[magnetic moment]]\u2014is determined by these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field, but the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due to the nature of electrons to obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], in which no two electrons may be found in the same [[quantum state]], bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons. < ref name=schroeder2/ > \n \n In [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an [[exchange interaction]]. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. [[Paramagnetism|Paramagnetic materials]] have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of a field. < ref name=schroeder2/ > < ref name=goebel20070901/ > \n \n The nucleus of an atom will have no spin when it has even numbers of both neutrons and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of [[thermal equilibrium]], but for certain elements (such as [[xenon|xenon-129]]) it is possible to [[spin polarization|polarize]] a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction\u2014a condition called [[hyperpolarization (physics)|hyperpolarization]].

The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, i.e. [[stationary state]], while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state. < ref name=zeghbroeck1998/ >  The electron's energy increases along with [[principal quantum number|''n'']] because the (average) distance to the nucleus increases. Dependence of the energy on [[azimuthal quantum number|{{ell}}]] is caused not by the [[electrostatic potential]] of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons. \n \n For an electron to [[atomic electron transition|transition between two different states]], e.g. [[ground state]] to first [[excited state]], it must absorb or emit a [[photon]] at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels, according to the [[Niels Bohr]] model, what can be precisely calculated by the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]. \n Electrons jump between orbitals in a particle-like fashion. For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon; see [[Atomic orbital|Electron properties]]. \n \n The energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its [[frequency]], so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. < ref > {{cite book \n |last=Fowles|first=Grant R.|year=1989 \n |title=Introduction to Modern Optics \n |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontomo00fowl_441|url-access=limited|publisher=Courier Dover Publications \n |isbn=978-0-486-65957-2 \n |oclc=18834711|pages=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontomo00fowl_441/page/n233 227]\u2013233}} \n < /ref >  Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors. < ref name=martin2007/ > \n \n [[File:Fraunhofer lines.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|An example of absorption lines in a spectrum]] \n \n When a continuous [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum of energy]] is passed through a gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark [[absorption band]]s in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of [[emission line]]s from the photons emitted by the atoms.) [[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] measurements of the strength and width of [[atomic spectral line]]s allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined. < ref name=avogadro/ > \n \n Close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a [[fine structure]] splitting. This occurs because of [[spin-orbit coupling]], which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. < ref name=fitzpatrick20070216/ >  When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the [[Zeeman effect]]. This is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple [[electron configuration]]s with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. < ref name=weiss2001/ >  The presence of an external [[electric field]] can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the [[Stark effect]]. < ref > {{cite book \n |last1=Beyer|first1=H.F. \n |last2=Shevelko|first2=V.P. \n |year=2003 \n |title=Introduction to the Physics of Highly Charged Ions \n |publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7503-0481-8 \n |oclc=47150433|pages=232\u2013236}} < /ref > \n \n If a bound electron is in an excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause [[stimulated emission]] of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make [[laser]]s, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band. < ref name=watkins_sjsu/ > \n \n ===Valence and bonding behavior=== \n {{Main|Valence (chemistry)|Chemical bond}} \n \n Valency is the combining power of an element. It is determined by the number of bonds it can form to other atoms or groups. < ref > {{GoldBookRef|title=valence|file=V06588}} < /ref >  The outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as the [[valence shell]], and the electrons in \n that shell are called [[valence electron]]s. The number of valence electrons determines the [[chemical bond|bonding]] \n behavior with other atoms. Atoms tend to [[Chemical reaction|chemically react]] with each other in a manner that fills (or empties) their outer valence shells. < ref name=reusch20070716/ >  For example, a transfer of a single electron between atoms is a useful approximation for bonds that form between atoms with one-electron more than a filled shell, and others that are one-electron short of a full shell, such as occurs in the compound [[sodium chloride]] and other chemical ionic salts. Many elements display multiple valences, or tendencies to share differing numbers of electrons in different compounds. Thus, [[chemical bond]]ing between these elements takes many forms of electron-sharing that are more than simple electron transfers. Examples include the element carbon and the [[organic compounds]]. < ref name=chemguide/ > \n \n The [[chemical element]]s are often displayed in a [[periodic table]] that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with the same number of valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the [[noble gas]]es. < ref name=husted20031211/ > < ref name=baum2003/ > \n \n ===States=== \n {{Main|State of matter|Phase (matter)}} \n \n [[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|right|thumb|Graphic illustrating the formation of a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]] ]] \n Quantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as [[temperature]] and [[pressure]].

The surface atoms deviate from the bulk [[crystal structure]] and arrange in columns several atoms wide with pits between them (See [[surface reconstruction]]).]] \n While atoms are too small to be seen, devices such as the [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) enable their visualization at the surfaces of solids. The microscope uses the [[quantum tunneling]] phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would be insurmountable in the classical perspective. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two [[Biasing|biased]] electrodes, providing a tunneling current that is exponentially dependent on their separation. One electrode is a sharp tip ideally ending with a single atom. At each point of the scan of the surface the tip's height is adjusted so as to keep the tunneling current at a set value. How much the tip moves to and away from the surface is interpreted as the height profile. For low bias, the microscope images the averaged electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels\u2014the local [[density of states|density of the electronic states]] near the [[Fermi level]]. < ref name=jacox1997/ > < ref name=nf_physics1986/ >  Because of the distances involved, both electrodes need to be extremely stable; only then periodicities can be observed that correspond to individual atoms. The method alone is not chemically specific, and cannot identify the atomic species present at the surface. \n \n Atoms can be easily identified by their mass. If an atom is [[ion]]ized by removing one of its electrons, its trajectory when it passes through a [[magnetic field]] will bend. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field is determined by the mass of the atom. The [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] uses this principle to measure the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include [[inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy]] and [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]], both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis. < ref name=sab53_13_1739/ > \n \n The [[atom probe|atom-probe tomograph]] has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify individual atoms using time-of-flight mass spectrometry. < ref name=rsi39_1_83/ > \n \n Electron emission techniques such as [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS) and [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] (AES), which measure the binding energies of the [[core electron]]s, are used to identify the atomic species present in a sample in a non-destructive way. With proper focusing both can be made area-specific. Another such method is [[electron energy loss spectroscopy]] (EELS), which measures the energy loss of an [[electron beam]] within a [[transmission electron microscope]] when it interacts with a portion of a sample. \n \n Spectra of [[excited state]]s can be used to analyze the atomic composition of distant [[star]]s. Specific light [[wavelength]]s contained in the observed light from stars can be separated out and related to the quantized transitions in free gas atoms. These colors can be replicated using a [[gas-discharge lamp]] containing the same element. < ref name=lochner2007/ >  [[Helium]] was discovered in this way in the spectrum of the Sun 23 & nbsp;years before it was found on Earth. < ref name=winter2007/ > \n \n ==Origin and current state== \n [[Baryonic matter]] forms about 4% of the total energy density of the [[observable Universe]], with an average density of about 0.25 & nbsp;particles/m < sup > 3 < /sup >  (mostly [[proton]]s and electrons). < ref name=hinshaw20060210/ >  Within a galaxy such as the [[Milky Way]], particles have a much higher concentration, with the density of matter in the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) ranging from 10 < sup > 5 < /sup >  to 10 < sup > 9 < /sup >  atoms/m < sup > 3 < /sup > . < ref > {{cite book \n |last1=Choppin|first1=Gregory R. \n |last2=Liljenzin|first2=Jan-Olov|last3=Rydberg|first3=Jan \n |year=2001|title=Radiochemistry and Nuclear Chemistry \n |publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-7506-7463-8 \n |oclc=162592180|page=441}} < /ref >  The Sun is believed to be inside the [[Local Bubble]], so the density in the solar neighborhood is only about 10 < sup > 3 < /sup >  atoms/m < sup > 3 < /sup > . < ref name=science259_5093_327/ >  Stars form from dense clouds in the ISM, and the evolutionary processes of stars result in the steady enrichment of the ISM with elements more massive than hydrogen and helium. \n \n Up to 95% of the Milky Way's baryonic matter are concentrated inside stars, where conditions are unfavorable for atomic matter.
