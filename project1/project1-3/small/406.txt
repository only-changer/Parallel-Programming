These numbers do not include earlier states of languages, such as [[Middle Mongol language|Middle Mongol]], [[Old Korean]] or [[Old Japanese]]. \n \n ==Earliest attestations of the languages== \n The earliest known texts in a Turkic language are the [[Orkhon inscriptions]], 720\u2013735 AD. < ref name=miller71/ > {{rp|3}} They were deciphered in 1893 by the Danish linguist [[Vilhelm Thomsen]] in a scholarly race with his rival, the German\u2013Russian linguist [[Vasily Radlov|Wilhelm Radloff]]. However, Radloff was the first to publish the inscriptions. \n \n The first Tungusic language to be attested is [[Jurchen language|Jurchen]], the language of the ancestors of the [[Qing dynasty|Manchus]]. A writing system for it was devised in 1119 AD and an inscription using this system is known from 1185 (see [[List of Jurchen inscriptions]]). \n \n The earliest [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] language of which we have written evidence is known as [[Middle Mongol language|Middle Mongol]]. It is first attested by an inscription dated to 1224 or 1225 AD, the [[Stele of Yis\u00fcngge]], and by the ''[[Secret History of the Mongols]]'', written in 1228 (see [[Mongolic languages]]). The earliest Para-Mongolic text is the [[Memorial for Yel\u00fc Yanning]], written in the [[Khitan large script]] and dated to 986 AD. However, the [[Inscription of H\u00fcis Tolgoi]], discovered in 1975 and analysed as being in an early form of Mongolic, has been dated to 604-620 AD. The [[Bugut inscription]] dates back to 584 AD. \n \n Japanese is first attested in the form of names contained in a few short inscriptions in [[Classical Chinese]] from the 5th century AD, such as found on the [[Inariyama Sword]]. The first substantial text in Japanese, however, is the [[Kojiki]], which dates from 712 AD. It is followed by the [[Nihon Shoki|Nihon shoki]], completed in 720, and then by the [[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]], which dates from [[circa|c.]] 771\u2013785, but includes material that is from about 400 years earlier. < ref name=miller71/ > {{rp|4}} \n \n The most important text for the study of early Korean is the [[Hyangga]], a collection of 25 poems, of which some go back to the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] period (57 BC\u2013668 AD), but are preserved in an [[orthography]] that only goes back to the 9th century AD. < ref name=miller96/ > {{rp|60}} Korean is copiously attested from the mid-15th century on in the phonetically precise [[Hangul]] system of writing. < ref name=miller96/ > {{rp|61}} \n \n ==History of the Altaic family concept== \n [[File:2006-07 altaj belucha.jpg|thumb|The Altai Mountains in East-Central Asia give their name to the proposed language family.]] \n \n ===Origins=== \n A proposed grouping of the Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages was published in 1730 by [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]], a Swedish officer who traveled in the eastern [[Russian Empire]] while a prisoner of war after the [[Great Northern War]]. < ref name=poppe65 > Nicholas Poppe (1965): ''Introduction to Altaic Linguistics.''

The name  \" Uralic \"  referred to the [[Ural Mountains]]. \n \n While the Ural-Altaic family hypothesis can still be found in some encyclopedias, atlases, and similar general references, after the 1960s it has been heavily criticized. Even linguists who accept the basic Altaic family, like [[Sergei Starostin]], completely discard the inclusion of the  \" Uralic \"  branch. < ref name=staro2003/ > {{rp|8\u20139}} \n \n ===Korean and Japanese languages=== \n In 1857, the Austrian scholar [[Anton Boller]] suggested adding [[Japanese language|Japanese]] to the Ural\u2013Altaic family. < ref name=miller86 > Roy Andrew Miller (1986): ''Nihongo: In Defence of Japanese.'' {{ISBN|0-485-11251-5}}. < /ref > {{rp|34}} \n \n In the 1920s, [[Gustaf John Ramstedt|G.J. Ramstedt]] and [[Yevgeny Polivanov|E.D. Polivanov]] advocated the inclusion of Korean. Decades later, in his 1952 book, Ramstedt rejected the Ural\u2013Altaic hypothesis but again included Korean in Altaic, an inclusion followed by most leading Altaicists (supporters of the theory) to date. < !--Which date?-- > < ref name=rams > Gustaf John Ramstedt (1952): ''Einf\u00fchrung in die altaische Sprachwissenschaft'' ( \" Introduction to Altaic Linguistics \" ).

Poppe considered the issue of the relationship of Korean to Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic not settled. < ref name=poppe65/ > {{rp|148}} In his view, there were three possibilities: (1) Korean did not belong with the other three genealogically, but had been influenced by an Altaic substratum; (2) Korean was related to the other three at the same level they were related to each other; (3) Korean had split off from the other three before they underwent a series of characteristic changes. \n \n [[Roy Andrew Miller]]'s 1971 book ''Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages'' convinced most Altaicists that Japanese also belonged to Altaic. < ref name=poppe76 > Nicholas Poppe (1976):  \" [https://www.jstor.org/pss/132066 Review of Karl H.

Some authors instead tried to connect Japanese to the [[Austronesian languages]]. < ref name=staro2003/ > {{rp|8\u20139}} \n \n In 2017 [[Martine Robbeets]] proposed that Japanese (and possibly Korean) originated as a [[creole language|hybrid language]]. She proposed that the [[urheimat|ancestral home]] of the Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages was somewhere in northwestern [[Manchuria]]. A group of those proto-Altaic ( \" Transeurasian \" ) speakers would have migrated south into the modern [[Liaoning]] province, where they would have been mostly assimilated by an agricultural community with an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]-like language.

They state that both are  \" still so different from the Core Altaic languages that we can even speak of an independent Japanese-Korean type of grammar. Given also that there is neither a strong proof of common Proto-Altaic lexical items nor solid regular sound correspondences but, rather, only lexical and structural borrowings between languages of the Altaic typology, our results indirectly speak in favour of a \u201cPaleo-Asiatic\u201d origin of the Japonic and Koreanic languages. \" < ref > {{Cite web|last=Yurayong, Szeto|date=August 2020|title=Altaicization and De-Altaicization of Japonic and Koreanic|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343576887|website=International Journal of Eurasian Linguistics|quote=Despite the conventional classification of Japonic and Koreanic languages as examples of the Altaic typology (Janhunen 2007, 2014, Tranter 2012a), these languages, both today and in the past, are still so different from the Core Altaic languages that we can even speak of an independent Japanese-Korean type of grammar (see also Vovin 2015a).

However, through later intense language contacts, Japanese and Koreanic converged by the phenomena of Altaicization and de-Altaicization during the first millennium BC and AD, respectively (see also Janhunen 2010: 290, Vovin 2010: 239\u2013240).}} < /ref > \n \n ===The Ainu language=== \n In 1962 John C.

For example, although most of today's Altaic languages have vowel harmony, Proto-Altaic as reconstructed by them lacked it; instead, various vowel assimilations between the first and second syllables of words occurred in Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Korean, and Japonic. They also included a number of grammatical correspondences between the languages. < ref name=staro2003/ > \n \n ====Shared lexicon==== \n Starostin claimed in 1991 that the members of the proposed Altaic group shared about 15\u201320% of apparent cognates within a 110-word [[Swadesh list#Shorter lists|Swadesh-Yakhontov list]]; in particular, Turkic\u2013Mongolic 20%, Turkic\u2013Tungusic 18%, Turkic\u2013Korean 17%, Mongolic\u2013Tungusic 22%, Mongolic\u2013Korean 16%, and Tungusic\u2013Korean 21%. < ref name=staro91 > Sergei A.

According to their results, Koreanic (and Japonic) language spread can be linked to the spread of rice-cultivation and rice farming related vocabulary as opposed to millet farming which was practiced in a geographical nearby region in Manchuria. The authors point out that isotopic studies clearly show that sea resources and wild plants were the main diet of the people in Korea during the [[Jeulmun pottery period|Chulmun period]] (period including the arrival of millet agriculture), that introduction of millet agriculture didn't heavily affect the material culture and subsistence economy of the Chulmun culture and noted with a summary of previous demographic studies that the population seems to suddenly decrease in a period coinciding with the arrival of millet whereas it should increase in the context of a people migration. < ref name =  \" Kim and Park 2020 \" / >  They suggest two scenarios explaining the spread of Koreanic and Japonic (which they agree to reunite in the [[Comparison of Japanese and Korean|Japano-Koreanic family]]) : The first one is that Proto-Japonic and Proto-Koreanic already split before their entrance in [[Korean peninsula]] and migrated together, bringing with them the dry farming of rice and giving way to the [[Mumun pottery period|Mumun period]]; Proto-Japonic speakers would later have aggregated in southern Korea and developed the [[Songguk-ri|Songgukri culture]]. The second one suggests that Proto-Japano-Koreanic speakers migrated to Korea and that Proto-Japonic and Proto-Koreanic respectively developed in the southwestern and central parts of the peninsula. However they admit themselves that both scenarios have problems, the first one is difficult to reconcile with the fact that Early Mumun archeological was homogenous throughout the peninsula, the two groups cannot be clearly distinguished; the second scenario assumes a relatively recent split between Japonic and Koreanic whereas the linguistic distance is too great to assume it. < ref name =  \" Kim and Park 2020 \" / > \n Anyway they support a rice farming dispersal and argue that they can not be linked to the millet farming cultures, rejecting Robbeets' proposal of a Northeast China origin for Koreanic and Japonic (on which the modern Transeurasian theory is based ). < ref name =  \" Kim and Park 2020 \" > {{Cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Jangsuk|last2=Park|first2=Jinho|date=5 May 2020|title=Millet vs rice: an evaluation of the farming/language dispersal hypothesis in the Korean context|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/millet-vs-rice-an-evaluation-of-the-farminglanguage-dispersal-hypothesis-in-the-korean-context/C35E82F5B6E40AA949AA58A885E3EC71|journal=Evolutionary Human Sciences|language=en|volume=2|doi=10.1017/ehs.2020.13|issn=2513-843X|doi-access=free}} < /ref > \n \n However, Hudson and Robbeets (2020) responded to this study and still maintain that archaeological elements relating to sedentism, pottery, stone tools and weaving technology supports a Northeast China agricultural origin for proto-Koreanic and proto-Japonic. They pointed out several problems in the arguments of Kim and Park. < ref name =  \" Hudson and Robbeets 2020 \" / >  Many of the isotope studies are from coastal shell middens, where human bones are better preserved, and not inland sites. < ref name =  \" Hudson and Robbeets 2020 \" / >  The farming/language hypotheses doesn't require that farming was the only nor the largest component of a subsistence economy. < ref name =  \" Hudson and Robbeets 2020 \" / >  A language shift does not require a massive initial influx of speakers and the possibility of a small number of speakers which later grew is not evaluated, it has been proved in previous studies that even small technological advantages can heavily impact the language shift; Kim and Park placed the introduction of millet agriculture in 3500 BC and interpreted its arrival as a population decrease whereas previous studies they didn't consider showed several evidences for an arrival of millet one or two centuries earlier, which is actually consistent with a population increase, recent studies have even noted an 'explosive' and rapid demographic increase with the arrival of millet agriculture in Korea. < ref name =  \" Hudson and Robbeets 2020 \" / >  Hudson and Robbeets suggest that a ''[[Yersina pestis]]'' epidemic was probably the main reason of this drastic decrease, pointing out many evidences. < ref name =  \" Hudson and Robbeets 2020 \" / >  They argue that there is in fact no common rice vocabulary shared between proto-Koreanic and proto-Japonic, indicating that the separation between the two families would have occurred before the introduction of rice farming and placing it in Northeast China rather than Korea. < ref name =  \" Hudson and Robbeets 2020 \" / >  In addition to the problems cited by Kim and Park for their scenarios, Hudson and Robbeets also support that Proto-Japonic was spoken in the north of the peninsula and not the south, arguing that the [[Puy\u014f languages]] \u2014 spoken in Northern Korea and Liaodong peninsula by the beginning of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] \u2014 were more closely related to Japanese than to Korean. < ref name =  \" Hudson and Robbeets 2020 \" > {{Cite journal|last1=Hudson|first1=Mark J.|last2=Robbeets|first2=Martine|date=14 October 2020|title=Archaeolinguistic evidence for the farming/language dispersal of Koreanic|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/archaeolinguistic-evidence-for-the-farminglanguage-dispersal-of-koreanic/CE1DF81011ED49CED531AA6475959157|journal=Evolutionary Human Sciences|language=en|volume=2|doi=10.1017/ehs.2020.49|issn=2513-843X|doi-access=free}} < /ref > \n \n ===Against the grouping=== \n ====Weakness of lexical and typological data==== \n According to G.

They noted that there was little vocabulary shared by Turkic and Tungusic languages, though more shared with Mongolic languages. They reasoned that, if all three families had a common ancestor, we should expect losses to happen at random, and not only at the geographical margins of the family; and that the observed pattern is consistent with borrowing. < ref name=clauson56/ > < ref name=doerfer63/ > < ref name=shche63/ > \n \n According to C. Sch\u00f6nig (2003), after accounting for areal effects, the shared lexicon that could have a common genetic origin was reduced to a small number of monosyllabic lexical roots, including the personal pronouns and a few other deictic and auxiliary items, whose sharing could be explained in other ways; not the kind of sharing expected in cases of genetic relationship. < ref name=schon03 > Sch\u00f6nig (2003):  \" Turko-Mongolic Relations. \"  In ''The Mongolic Languages'', edited by Juha Janhunen, pages 403\u2013419.

Whereas for certain other language families, such as the speakers of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]], [[Proto-Uralic language|Uralic]], and [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], it is possible to frame substantial hypotheses, in the case of the proposed Altaic family much remains to be done. < ref > Miller (1991), page 319\u2013320 < /ref > \n \n < !--[[Urheimat]]: \n In the absence of written records, there are several ways to study the (pre)history of a people: \n *Identification of [[archaeological culture]]s: the material remains found at dwelling sites, burial grounds, and other places where people left traces of their activity. \n *[[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropology]], which studies the physical characteristics of peoples, ancient and modern. \n *[[Genetics]], particularly the study of [[ancient DNA]].  \n *[[Philology]], which studies the evidence in language families for their primitive locations and the nature of their cultures. (For an example, see [[Proto-Uralic language#Vocabulary|Proto-Uralic language]].) Mythology and legend often contain important clues to the earlier history of peoples. \n *[[Glottochronology]], which attempts to estimate the time depth of a language family based on an assumed rate of change in languages. Related to this is [[lexicostatistics]], which attempts to determine the degree of relation between a set of languages by comparing the percentage of basic vocabulary (words like  \" I \" ,  \" you \" ,  \" heart \" ,  \" stone \" ,  \" two \" ,  \" be \" ,  \" and \" ) they share in common. \n *The development of a family tree of languages that notes the relative distance of the splits that occur in it. \n *The observation of evidence for [[Language contact|contact between languages]], which may approximate when and where they were adjacent to each other. \n \n All of these methods remain to be applied to the languages attributed to Altaic with the same degree of focus and intensity with which they have been applied to the Indo-European family (e.g. Mallory 1989, Anthony 2007). < ref name=mall1989 > J.
