The national divinity of the Greeks, Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the [[Sun]] and light, poetry, and more. One of the most important and complex of the Greek gods, he is the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin brother of [[Artemis]], goddess of the hunt. Seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the ''[[kouros]]'' (ephebe, or a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all the gods. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced [[Etruscan mythology]] as ''Apulu''. < ref > Krauskopf, I. 2006.  \" The Grave and Beyond. \"  ''The Religion of the Etruscans.'' edited by N. de Grummond and E. Simon. Austin: University of Texas Press. p. vii, p. 73-75. < /ref > \n \n As the patron deity of [[Delphi]] (''Apollo Pythios''), Apollo is an [[oracular]] god\u2014the prophetic [[deity]] of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]]. Apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil; various epithets call him the  \" averter of evil \" . Delphic Apollo is the patron of seafarers, foreigners and the protector of fugitives and refugees. \n \n Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son [[Asclepius]]. Apollo delivered people from epidemics, yet he is also a god who could bring ill-health and deadly [[Plague (disease)|plague]] with his arrows. The invention of archery itself is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis. Apollo is usually described as carrying a golden bow and a quiver of silver arrows. Apollo's capacity to make youths grow is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona. As the protector of young (''kourotrophos''), Apollo is concerned with the health and education of children. He presided over their passage into adulthood. Long hair, which was the prerogative of boys, was cut at the coming of age (ephebeia) and dedicated to Apollo. \n \n Apollo is an important pastoral deity, and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds. Protection of herds, flocks and crops from diseases, pests and predators were his primary duties. On the other hand, Apollo also encouraged founding new towns and establishment of civil constitution. He is associated with dominion over [[Colonies in antiquity|colonists]]. He was the giver of laws, and his oracles were consulted before setting laws in a city. \n \n As the god of ''mousike''{{efn|''Mousike'' (the art of the Muses) was an integral part of life in the ancient Greek world, and the term covered not only music but also dance, lyrics, theatre and the performance of poetry.}} Apollo presides over all music, songs, dance and poetry. He is the inventor of string-music, and the frequent companion of the Muses, functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations. The lyre is a common [[#Attributes and symbols|attribute of Apollo]]. In Hellenistic times, especially during the 5th century BCE, as ''Apollo Helios'' he became identified among Greeks with [[Helios]], the personification of the sun. < ref > For the iconography of the Alexander\u2013Helios type, see H.

It was in this way that Apollo had become recognized as the god of music. Apollo's role as the slayer of the [[Python (mythology)|Python]] led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won. \n \n In the ''Iliad'', Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the [[Vedic]] god of disease [[Rudra]]. < ref name= \" Martin Nilsson 1967 p. 541 \" > \" The conception that the diseases come from invisible shots sent by magicians or supernatural beings is common in primitive people and also in European folklore.

They show the spread of the cult of Apollo and the evolution of the Greek architecture, which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations. Some of the earliest temples, especially in [[Crete]], do not belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered [[divinity|divine]], and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of [[Doric order]]. The Greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be [[Canon (basic principle)|canonic]], and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection. < ref > To know what a thing is, we must know the look of it \" : Rhys Carpenter: ''The esthetic basis of Greek art''. Indiana University Press. p. 108 < /ref >  From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of [[Pythagoras]], who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics. < ref name= \" C. M. Bowra 1957 p. 166 \" > C. M. Bowra (1957). ''The Greek experience'', p. 166. < /ref > \n \n The [[Doric order]] dominated during the 6th and the 5th century BC but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs, which couldn't be solved without changing the original forms. The order was almost abandoned for the [[Ionic order]], but the Ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple. Both orders were abandoned for the [[Corinthian order]] gradually during the Hellenistic age and under Rome. \n \n The most important temples are: \n \n ===Greek temples=== \n *[[Thebes, Greece]]: The oldest temple probably dedicated to ''Apollo Ismenius'' was built in the 9th century B.C.

As Zeus' favorite son, Apollo had direct access to the mind of Zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans. A divinity beyond human comprehension, he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god. \n \n ===Birth=== \n [[File:Metropolitan Richart Latona.jpg|thumb|Leto with her children, by William Henry Rinehart]] \n \n Apollo was the son of Zeus, the king of the gods, and Leto, his previous wife < ref > Homer, ''Iliad'' 21.499 < /ref >  or one of his mistresses. Growing up, Apollo was nursed by the nymphs Korythalia and [[Aletheia (disambiguation)|Aletheia]], the personification of truth. < ref > Plutarch, ''Moralia'' 657e < /ref > \n \n When Zeus' wife [[Hera]] discovered that [[Leto]] was pregnant, she banned Leto from giving birth on ''[[Solid Earth|terra firma]]''. Leto sought shelter in many lands, only to be rejected by them. Finally, the voice of unborn Apollo informed his mother about a floating island named [[Delos]] that had once been [[Asteria (Titaness)|Asteria]], Leto's own sister. < ref name= \" Callimachus, Hymn to Delos \" > Callimachus, ''Hymn to Delos'' < /ref >  Since it was neither a mainland nor an island, Leto was readily welcomed there and gave birth to her children under a palm tree. All the goddesses except Hera were present to witness the event. It is also stated that Hera kidnapped [[Eileithyia]], the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace of amber 9 yards (8.2 m) long. < ref name= \" Homeric hymn to Apollo \" / > \n \n [[File:Latona with Her Children Apollo and Diana LACMA M.78.86.jpg|thumb|Leto holding Apollo, by Lazar Widmann]] \n When Apollo was born, clutching a golden sword, < ref > {{Cite book|title=Works and Days|last=Hesiod|date=2007 |doi=10.4159/dlcl.hesiod-works_days.2007}} < /ref >  everything on Delos turned into gold < ref name= \" Callimachus, Hymn to Delos \" / >  and the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance. < ref > Theognis, Fragment 1. 5 < /ref >  Swans circled the island seven times and the nymphs sang in delight. < ref name= \" Callimachus, Hymn to Delos \" / >  He was washed clean by the goddesses who then covered him in white garment and fastened golden bands around him. Since Leto was unable to feed him, [[Themis]], the goddess of divine law, fed him with nectar, or [[ambrosia]]. Upon tasting the divine food, Apollo broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of [[lyre]] and archery, and interpret the will of Zeus to humankind. < ref name= \" Homeric hymn to Apollo \" > Homer, ''Hymn to Apollo'' < /ref >  Zeus, who had calmed Hera by then, came and adorned his son with a golden headband. < ref > Alcaeus, ''Hymn to Apollo'' < /ref > < ref > Himerius, ''Oration'' < /ref > \n \n [[File:Latona with the infants Apollo and Artemis, by Francesco Pozzi, 1824, marble - Sculpture Gallery, Chatsworth House - Derbyshire, England - DSC03504.jpg|thumb|Leto with Apollo and Artemis, by Francesco Pozzi]] \n \n Apollo's birth fixed the floating Delos to the earth. < ref name= \" Homeric hymn to Apollo \" / >  Leto promised that her son would be always favorable towards the Delians. According to some, Apollo secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean after some time. < ref > Virgil, ''Aeneid'' 3.80 < /ref > < ref > Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'' < /ref >  This island became sacred to Apollo and was one of the major cult centres of the god. \n \n Apollo was born on the seventh day ({{lang|grc|\u1f11\u03b2\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2}}, ''hebdomagenes'') < ref > {{LSJ|e(bdomagenh/s|\u1f11\u03b2\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2|shortref}}. < /ref >  of the month [[Attic calendar#Festival calendar|Thargelion]]\u2014according to Delian tradition\u2014or of the month [[Hellenic calendars#Delphic|Bysios]]\u2014according to Delphian tradition. The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=184}} Mythographers agree that [[Artemis]] was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of Apollo or was born on the island of [[Ortygia]] then helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo. \n \n ===Hyperborea=== \n \n [[Hyperborea]], the mystical land of eternal spring, venerated Apollo above all the gods. The Hyperboreans always sang and danced in his honor and hosted [[Pythian games]]. < ref > Pindar, Pindar, Olympian Ode < /ref >  There, a vast forest of beautiful trees was called  \" the garden of Apollo \" . Apollo spent the winter months among the Hyperboreans. < ref > Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 2. 674 < /ref > < ref name= \" ReferenceA \" / >  His absence from the world caused coldness and this was marked as his annual death. No prophecies were issued during this time. < ref name= \" ReferenceC \" > Joseph Eddy Fontenrose, ''Python: A Study of Delphic Myth and Its Origins'' < /ref >  He returned to the world during the beginning of the spring. The ''Theophania'' festival was held in [[Delphi]] to celebrate his return. < ref > Plutarch, ''de his qui sero a num. pun.'' p. 557F < /ref > \n \n It is said that Leto came to Delos from Hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves. Henceforth, Hyperborea became Apollo's winter home and wolves became sacred to him. His intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet ''Lyceus'', meaning ''wolf-like''. But Apollo was also the wolf-slayer in his role as the god who protected flocks from predators. The Hyperborean worship of Apollo bears the strongest marks of Apollo being worshipped as the sun god. Shamanistic elements in Apollo's cult are often liked to his Hyperborean origin, and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman. < ref > Anna Afonasina, ''Shamanism and the Orphic tradition'' < /ref > < ref > Fritz Graf, ''Apollo'' < /ref >  Shamans like [[Abaris]] and [[Aristeas]] were also the followers of Apollo, who hailed from Hyperborea. \n \n In myths, the tears of amber Apollo shed when his son Asclepius died became the waters of the river Eridanos, which surrounded Hyperborea. Apollo also buried in Hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the [[Cyclopes]]. He later gave this arrow to Abaris. < ref > Apollonius Rhodius, ''Argonautica'' 4. 594 < /ref > \n \n ===Childhood and youth=== \n \n As a child, Apollo is said to have built a foundation and an altar on Delos using the horns of the goats that his sister Artemis hunted. Since he learnt the art of building when young, he later came to be known as [[Archegetes]], ''the founder (of towns)'' and god who guided men to build new cities. < ref name= \" ReferenceA \" / >  From his father Zeus, Apollo had also received a golden chariot drawn by swans. < ref > Timothy P. Bridgman  \n  ''Hyperboreans: Myth and History in Celtic-Hellenic Contacts'' < /ref > \n \n [[File:John Flaxman - To Phoebus at His Birth, From Aeschylus, Furies - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]] gifts the oracular tripod to Apollo, by John Flaxman]] \n \n In his early years when Apollo spent his time herding cows, he was reared by [[Thriae]], the bee nymphs, who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills. < ref > Homeric Hymn 4 to Hermes 550 < /ref >  Apollo is also said to have invented the lyre, and along with Artemis, the art of archery. He then taught to the humans the art of healing and archery. < ref > Diodorus, ''Library of history'' 5.74.5 < /ref >  [[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]], his grandmother, gave the oracular shrine of [[Delphi]] to Apollo as a birthday gift.

To avenge the trouble given to his mother, Apollo went in search of Python and killed it in the sacred cave at Delphi with the bow and arrows that he had received from [[Hephaestus]]. The Delphian nymphs who were present encouraged Apollo during the battle with the cry  \" Hie [[Paean]] \" . After Apollo was victorious, they also brought him gifts and gave the [[Corycian cave]] to him. < ref name= \" ReferenceC \" / > < ref > ''Children of the Gods'' by [[Kenneth McLeish]], p. 32. < /ref >  According to Homer, Apollo had encountered and killed the Python when he was looking for a place to establish his shrine. \n \n According to another version, when Leto was in Delphi, Python had attacked her. Apollo defended his mother and killed Python. < ref > Euripides Iphigenia in Tauris < /ref >  [[Euripides]] in his ''[[Iphigenia in Aulis]]'' gives an account of his fight with Python and the event's aftermath.  \n < blockquote > You killed him, o Phoebus, while still a baby, still leaping in the arms of your dear mother, and you entered the holy shrine, and sat on the golden tripod, on your truthful throne distributing prophecies from the gods to mortals. < /blockquote > \n \n A detailed account of Apollo's conflict with Gaia and Zeus' intervention on behalf of his young son is also given.  \n < blockquote > But when Apollo came and sent Themis, the child of Earth, away from the holy oracle of Pytho, Earth gave birth to dream visions of the night; and they told to the cities of men the present, and what will happen in the future, through dark beds of sleep on the ground; and so Earth took the office of prophecy away from Phoebus, in envy, because of her daughter. The lord made his swift way to Olympus and wound his baby hands around Zeus, asking him to take the wrath of the earth goddess from the Pythian home. Zeus smiled, that the child so quickly came to ask for worship that pays in gold. He shook his locks of hair, put an end to the night voices, and took away from mortals the truth that appears in darkness, and gave the privilege back again to Loxias. < /blockquote > \n Apollo also demanded that all other methods of divination be made inferior to his, a wish that Zeus granted him readily. Because of this, Athena, who had been practicing divination by throwing pebbles, cast her pebbles away in displeasure. < ref > John Opsopaus, ''The Oracles of Apollo: Practical Ancient Greek Divination for Today'' < /ref > \n \n [[File:Apollo Killing the Python LACMA 54.70.1i.jpg|thumb|Apollo killing the Python, by Hendrik Goltzius]] \n \n However, Apollo had committed a blood murder and had to be purified. Because Python was a child of [[Gaia]], Gaia wanted Apollo to be banished to Tartarus as a punishment. < ref > Pindar's Paeans: A Reading of the Fragments with a Survey of the Genre < /ref >  Zeus didn't agree and instead exiled his son from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], and instructed him to get purified. Apollo had to serve as a slave for nine years. < ref > John Lempri\u00e8re, ''Bibliotheca Classica'' < /ref >  After the servitude was over, as per his father's order, he travelled to the [[Vale of Tempe]] to bath in waters of [[Pineios (Thessaly)|Peneus]]. < ref > The Uses of Greek Mythology By Ken Dowden < /ref >  There Zeus himself performed purificatory rites on Apollo. Purified, Apollo was escorted by his half sister [[Athena]] to Delphi where the oracular shrine was finally handed over to him by Gaia. < ref > Aristonous: Paean To Apollo < /ref >  According to a variation, Apollo had also travelled to Crete, where [[Carmanor (of Crete)|Carmanor]] purified him. Apollo later established the [[Pythian games]] to appropriate Gaia. Henceforth, Apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder and, made men aware of their guilt and purified them. < ref > Apollo, Fritz Graf < /ref > \n \n Soon after, Zeus instructed Apollo to go to Delphi and establish his law. But Apollo, disobeying his father, went to the land of [[Hyperborea]] and stayed there for a year. < ref > Timothy P. Bridgman, ''Hyperboreans: Myth and History in Celtic-Hellenic Contacts'' < /ref >  He returned only after the Delphians sang hymns to him and pleaded him to come back. Zeus, pleased with his son's integrity, gave Apollo the seat next to him on his right side. He also gave to Apollo various gifts, like a golden tripod, a golden bow and arrows, a golden chariot and the city of Delphi. < ref > Benjamin Acosta-Hughes, Luigi Lehnus, Susan Stephens - ''Brill's Companion to Callimachus'' < /ref > \n \n [[File:7003.Apollo mit dem get\u00f6teten Python(1752)-Fran\u00e7ois Gaspard Adam-Gro\u00dfe Font\u00e4ne-Sanssouci Steffen Heilfort.JPG|thumb|Apollo victorious over the Python, by Fran\u00e7ois Gaspard Adam]] \n \n Soon after his return, Apollo needed to recruit people to Delphi. So, when he spotted a ship sailing from Crete, he sprang aboard in the form of a dolphin. The crew was awed into submission and followed a course that led the ship to Delphi. There Apollo revealed himself as a god. Initiating them to his service, he instructed them to keep righteousness in their hearts. The [[Pythia]] was Apollo's high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies. Pythia is arguably the constant favorite of Apollo among the mortals. \n \n ====Tityos==== \n [[File:Apollo Tityos Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2689.jpg|thumb|Apollo slaying [[Tityos]], Attic red-figure kylix, 460\u2013450 BC]] \n \n Hera once again sent another giant, [[Tityos]] to rape Leto. This time Apollo shot him with his arrows and attacked him with his golden sword. According to other version, Artemis also aided him in protecting their mother by attacking Tityos with her arrows. < ref > Scholia on [[Pindar]], ''Pythian Odes'' 4.160 citing Pherecydes < /ref >  After the battle Zeus finally relented his aid and hurled Tityos down to [[Tartarus]]. There, he was pegged to the rock floor, covering an area of {{convert|9|acre|m2}}, where a pair of [[vulture]]s feasted daily on his liver. \n \n ===Admetus=== \n [[File:Drawing, Apollo Guards the Herds (or Flocks) of King Admetus, 1780\u20131800 (CH 18122047).jpg|thumb|Apollo Guards the Herds (or Flocks) of King [[Admetus]], by Felice Gianni]] \n \n [[Admetus]] was the king of [[Pherae]], who was known for his hospitality. When Apollo was exiled from Olympus for killing Python, he served as a herdsman under Admetus, who was then young and unmarried. Apollo is said to have shared a romantic relationship with Admetus during his stay. < ref name= \" ReferenceA \" > [[Callimachus]]: ''[https://www.theoi.com/Text/CallimachusHymns1.html Hymn to Apollo]'' < /ref >  After completing his years of servitude, Apollo went back to Olympus as a god. \n \n Because Admetus had treated Apollo well, the god conferred great benefits on him in return. Apollo's mere presence is said to have made the cattle give birth to twins. < ref name= \" bib-3-10-4 \" / > < ref name= \" ReferenceA \" / >  Apollo helped Admetus win the hand of [[Alcestis]], the daughter of [[Pelias|King Pelias]], < ref name= \" bib-1-9-15 \" > [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]], [https://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html Bibliotheca] 1.9.15 < /ref > < ref name= \" hyginus-50 \" > [[Hyginus]], [https://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae2.html Fabulae] 50-51 < /ref >  by taming a lion and a boar to draw Admetus' chariot.

Zeus obliged and sentenced Apollo to one year of [[Penal labour|hard labor]] once again under Admetus. < ref name= \" bib-3-10-4 \"  / > \n \n The love between Apollo and Admetus was a favored topic of Roman poets like [[Ovid]] and [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]. \n \n ===Niobe=== \n [[File:Pierre-Charles Jombert - Les enfants de Niob\u00e9 tu\u00e9s par Apollon et Diane.JPG|thumb|250px|''Niobe's children are killed by Apollo and Diana'' by [[Pierre-Charles Jombert]]]] \n \n The fate of [[Niobe]] was prophesied by Apollo while he was still in Leto's womb. < ref name= \" ReferenceA \" / >  Niobe was the queen of [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and wife of [[Amphion]]. She displayed [[hubris]] when she boasted that she was superior to Leto because she had fourteen children ([[Niobids]]), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two. She further mocked Apollo's effeminate appearance and Artemis' manly appearance. Leto, insulted by this, told her children to punish Niobe. Accordingly, Apollo killed Niobe's sons, and Artemis her daughters. According to some versions of the myth, among the Niobids, Chloris and her brother Amyclas were not killed because they prayed to Leto. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge. \n \n A devastated Niobe fled to [[Spil Mount|Mount Sipylos]] in [[Asia Minor]] and turned into stone as she wept. Her tears formed the river [[Achelous]]. Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them. \n \n When Chloris married and had children, Apollo granted her son [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] the years he had taken away from the Niobids. Hence, Nestor was able to live for 3 generations. < ref > Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 10 < /ref > \n \n ===Building the walls of Troy === \n \n Once Apollo and [[Poseidon]] served under the Trojan king [[Laomedon]] in accordance to Zeus' words. Apollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king disguised as humans in order to check his hubris. < ref > Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.5 < /ref >  Apollo guarded the cattle of Laomedon in the valleys of mount Ida, while Poseidon built the walls of Troy. < ref > Homer, ''The Iliad'' 21.434 < /ref >  Other versions make both Apollo and Poseidon the builders of the wall. In Ovid's account, Apollo completes his task by playing his tunes on his lyre. \n \n In [[Pindar]]'s odes, the gods took a mortal named [[Aeacus]] as their assistant. < ref > [[Pindar]], ''Olympian Odes'' viii. 39,  & c. < /ref >  When the work was completed, three snakes rushed against the wall, and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead, the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by Aeacus. Apollo immediately prophesied that [[Troy]] would fall at the hands of Aeacus's descendants, the [[Aeacidae]] (i.e. his son Telamon joined [[Heracles]] when he sieged the city during Laomedon's rule. Later, his great grandson [[Neoptolemus]] was present in the wooden horse that lead to the downfall of Troy). \n \n [[File:Sandrart (attributed), Troppa (attr.) - Laomedon Refusing Payment to Poseidon and Apollo - 17th c.jpg|thumb|Laomedon Refusing Payment to Poseidon and Apollo, by [[Joachim von Sandrart]]]] \n \n However, the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised, but also threatened to bind their feet and hands, and sell them as slaves. Angered by the unpaid labour and the insults, Apollo infected the city with a pestilence and Posedion sent the sea monster [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]]. To deliver the city from it, Laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter [[Hesione]] (who would later be saved by [[Heracles]]). \n \n During his stay in Troy, Apollo had a lover named Ourea, who was a nymph and daughter of Poseidon. Together they had a son named Ileus, whom Apollo loved dearly. < ref name= \" :7 \" > Hesiod, ''Catalogues of Women'' Fragment 83 < /ref > \n \n ===Trojan War=== \n \n Apollo sided with the Trojans during the [[Trojan War]] waged by the Greeks against the Trojans. \n \n During the war, the Greek king [[Agamemnon]] captured [[Chryseis]], the daughter of Apollo's priest [[Chryses]], and refused to return her. Angered by this, Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment. He demanded that they return the girl, and the Achaeans (Greeks) complied, indirectly causing the ''[[Achilles and Patroclus#In the Iliad|anger of Achilles]]'', which is the theme of the ''[[Iliad]]''. \n \n [[File:John Flaxman - Apollo Preceding Hector with His Aegis, and Dispersing the Greeks, Fuseli's Lectures - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Apollo preceding [[Hector]] with his [[Aegis]], and dispersing the Greeks, by John Flaxman]] \n \n Receiving the [[aegis]] from Zeus, Apollo entered the battlefield as per his father's command, causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry. He pushed the Greeks back and destroyed many of the soldiers. He is described as  \" the rouser of armies \"  because he rallied the Trojan army when they were falling apart. \n \n When Zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war, Apollo was provoked by Poseidon to a duel. However, Apollo declined to fight him, saying that he wouldn't fight his uncle for the sake of mortals. \n \n [[File:Diomedes prevented by Apollo from pursuing Aeneas (?) MET 80355.jpg|thumb|Apollo prevents [[Diomedes]] from pursuing [[Aeneas]]]] \n \n When the Greek hero [[Diomedes]] injured the Trojan hero [[Aeneas]], [[Aphrodite]] tried to rescue him, but Diomedes injured her as well. Apollo then enveloped Aeneas in a cloud to protect him. He repelled the attacks Diomedes made on him and gave the hero a stern warning to abstain himself from attacking a god. Aeneas was then taken to Pergamos, a sacred spot in [[Troy]], where he was healed. \n \n After the death of [[Sarpedon (Trojan War hero)|Sarpedon]], a son of Zeus, Apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his father's wish and cleaned it. He then gave it to Sleep ([[Hypnos]]) and Death ([[Thanatos]]). Apollo had also once convinced Athena to stop the war for that day, so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while. \n \n [[File:Hector's body dragged at the Chariot of Achilles.jpg|thumb|Apollo protecting Hector's body, by John Flaxman]] \n The Trojan hero [[Hector]] (who, according to some, was the god's own son by [[Hecuba]] < ref > [[Stesichorus]], Fr. 108; [[Tzetzes]], ''On Lycophron''  266; Porphyry in his ''Omissions'' states that [[Ibycus]], [[Alexander Aetolus|Alexander]], [[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorion]] and [[Lycophron]] all made Hector the son of Apollo. < /ref > ) was favored by Apollo. When he got severely injured, Apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up his arms. During a duel with Achilles, when Hector was about to lose, Apollo hid Hector in a cloud of mist to save him. When the Greek warrior [[Patroclus]] tried to get into the fort of Troy, he was stopped by Apollo. Encouraging Hector to attack Patroclus, Apollo stripped the armour of the Greek warrior and broke his weapons. Patroclus was eventually killed by Hector. At last, after Hector's fated death, Apollo protected his corpse from Achilles' attempt to mutilate it by creating a magical cloud over the corpse. \n < br / > \n \n [[File:Achilles slaying Troilus.PNG|thumb|[[Achilles]] slaying [[Troilus]]]] \n \n Apollo held a grudge against Achilles throughout the war because Achilles had murdered his son [[Tenes]] before the war began and brutally assassinated his son [[Troilus]] in his own temple. Not only did Apollo save Hector from Achilles, he also tricked Achilles by disguising himself as a Trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates. He foiled Achilles' attempt to mutilate Hector's dead body. \n \n Finally, Apollo caused Achilles' death by guiding an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] into [[Achilles]]' heel. In some versions, Apollo himself killed Achilles by taking the disguise of Paris. \n \n Apollo helped many Trojan warriors, including [[Agenor]], [[Polydamas (mythology)|Polydamas]], [[Glaucus]] in the battlefield. Though he greatly favored the Trojans, Apollo was bound to follow the orders of Zeus and served his father loyally during the war. \n \n ===Heracles=== \n \n After [[Heracles]] (then named Alcides) was struck with madness and killed his family, he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of Apollo. Apollo, through the Pythia, commanded him to serve king [[Eurystheus]] for twelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him. Only then would Alcides be absolved of his sin. Apollo also renamed him as Heracles. < ref > Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.1 < /ref > \n \n [[File:Corinthian helmet Cdm Paris BB2013 n2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Heracles and Apollo struggling over the Hind, as depicted on a Corinthian helmet (early 5th century BC)]] \n \n To complete his third task, Heracles had to capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]], a hind sacred to Artemis, and bring it alive. He chased the hind for one year. When the animal eventually got tired and tried crossing the river Ladon, he captured it. While he was taking it back, he was confronted by Apollo and Artemis, who were angered at Heracles for this act. However, Heracles soothed the goddess and explained his situation to her. After much pleading, Artemis permitted him to take the hind and told him to return it later. \n \n [[File:Herakles tripod Louvre F341.jpg|thumb|Heracles steals Apollo's tripod, Attic black-figure oinochoe, ca. 520 BC.]] \n \n After he was freed from his servitude to Eurystheus, Heracles fell in conflict with Iphytus, a prince of Oechalia, and murdered him. Soon after, he contracted a terrible disease. He consulted the oracle of Apollo once again, in hope of ridding himself of the disease. The Pythia, however, denied to give any prophesy. In anger, Heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started walking away, intending to start his own oracle. However, Apollo did not tolerate this and stopped Heracles; a duel ensued between them. Artemis rushed to support Apollo, while Athena supported Heracles. Soon, Zeus threw his thunderbolt between the fighting brothers and separated them. He reprimanded Heracles for this act of violation and asked Apollo to give a solution to Heracles. Apollo then ordered the hero to serve under [[Omphale]], queen of [[Lydia]] for one year in order to purify himself. \n \n ===Periphas=== \n \n [[Periphas]] was an Attican king and a priest of Apollo. He was noble, just and rich. He did all his duties justly. Because of this people were very fond of him and started honouring him to the same extent as Zeus. At one point, they worshipped Periphas in place of Zeus and set up shrines and temples for him. This annoyed Zeus, who decided to annihilate the entire family of Periphas. But because he was a just king and a good devotee, Apollo intervened and requested his father to spare Periphas. Zeus considered Apollo's words and agreed to let him live. But he metamorphosed Periphas into an eagle and made the eagle the king of birds. When Periphas' wife requested Zeus to let her stay with her husband, Zeus turned her into a vulture and fulfilled her wish. < ref > Antoninus Liberalis, ''Metamorphoses'' 6 < /ref > \n \n ===Plato's concept of soulmates=== \n \n A long time ago, there were three kinds of human beings: male, descended from the sun; female, descended from the earth; and androgynous, descended from the moon. Each human being was completely round, with four arms and fours legs, two identical faces on opposite sides of a head with four ears, and all else to match. They were powerful and unruly. [[Aloadae|Otis]] and [[Aloadae|Ephialtes]] even dared to scale [[Mount Olympus]]. \n \n To check their insolence, Zeus devised a plan to humble them and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them. He cut them all in two and asked Apollo to make necessary repairs, giving humans the individual shape they still have now. Apollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds, he pulled together their skin at the [[abdomen]], and sewed the skin together at the middle of it. This is what we call [[navel]] today. He smoothened the wrinkles and shaped the chest. But he made sure to leave a few wrinkles on the abdomen and around the navel so that they might be reminded of their punishment. < ref > Plato, ''[[The Symposium]]'' < /ref > \n \n < blockquote > \" As he [Zeus] cut them one after another, he bade Apollo give the face and the half of the neck a turn... Apollo was also bidden to heal their wounds and compose their forms. So Apollo gave a turn to the face and pulled the skin from the sides all over that which in our language is called the belly, like the purses which draw in, and he made one mouth at the centre [of the belly] which he fastened in a knot (the same which is called the navel); he also moulded the breast and took out most of the wrinkles, much as a shoemaker might smooth leather upon a last; he left a few wrinkles, however, in the region of the belly and navel, as a memorial of the primeval state. < /blockquote > \n \n ===Nurturer of the young=== \n \n Apollo ''Kourotrophos'' is the god who nurtures and protects children and the young, especially boys. He oversees their education and their passage into adulthood. Education is said to have originated from Apollo and the [[Muses]]. Many myths have him train his children. It was a custom for boys to cut and dedicate their long hair to Apollo after reaching adulthood. \n \n [[Chiron]], the abandoned [[centaur]], was fostered by Apollo, who instructed him in medicine, prophecy, archery and more. Chiron would later become a great teacher himself. \n \n [[Asclepius]] in his childhood gained much knowledge pertaining to medicinal arts by his father. However, he was later entrusted to Chiron for further education. \n \n [[Anius]], Apollo's son by [[Rhoeo]], was abandoned by his mother soon after his birth. Apollo brought him up and educated him in mantic arts. Anius later became the priest of Apollo and the king of Delos. \n \n [[Iamus]] was the son of Apollo and [[Evadne]]. When Evadne went into labour, Apollo sent the [[Moirai]] to assist his lover. After the child was born, Apollo sent snakes to feed the child some honey. When Iamus reached the age of education, Apollo took him to Olympia and taught him many arts, including the ability to understand and explain the languages of birds. < ref > Pindar, Olympian Ode 6 < /ref > \n \n [[Idmon]] was educated by Apollo to be a seer. Even though he foresaw his death that would happen in his journey with the [[Argonauts]], he embraced his destiny and died a brave death. To commemorate his son's bravery, Apollo commanded Boetians to build a town around the tomb of the hero, and to honor him. < ref > Apollonius Rhodius. Argonautica ii, 846 ff < /ref > \n \n Apollo adopted [[Carnus]], the abandoned son of Zeus and [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]]. He reared the child with the help of his mother Leto and educated him to be a seer. \n \n When his son [[Melaneus of Oechalia|Melaneus]] reached the age of marriage, Apollo asked the princess [[Stratonice (mythology)|Stratonice]] to be his son's bride and carried her away from her home when she agreed. \n \n Apollo saved a shepherd boy (name unknown) from death in a large deep cave, by the means of vultures. To thank him, the shepherd built Apollo a temple under the name Vulturius. < ref > The Cyclopedia, Or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature, Volume 37 < /ref > \n \n ===God of music=== \n \n Immediately after his birth, Apollo demanded a lyre and invented the [[paean]], thus becoming the god of music. As the divine singer, he is the patron of poets, singers and musicians. The invention of string music is attributed to him. [[Plato]] said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music, rhythm and harmony is the gift of Apollo and the Muses. < ref > [[Plato]], ''Laws'' 653.4 < /ref >  According to [[Socrates]], ancient Greeks believed that Apollo is the god who directs the harmony and makes all things move together, both for the gods and the humans. For this reason, he was called ''Homopolon'' before the ''Homo'' was replaced by ''A''. < ref > The prefix ''A'' means  \" without \"  or  \" not \" , and ''polloi'' means  \" many \" , thus ''Apollo'' means  \" not many \"  or  \" united \" , referring to his ability to create harmony. < /ref > < ref > [[Plato]], ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' < /ref >  Apollo's harmonious music delivered people from their pain, and hence, like Dionysus, he is also called the liberator. < ref name= \" ReferenceA \" / >  The swans, which were considered to be the most musical among the birds, were believed to be the  \" singers of Apollo \" . They are Apollo's sacred birds and acted as his vehicle during his travel to [[Hyperborea]]. < ref name= \" ReferenceA \" / >  [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] says that when the singers would sing hymns to Apollo, the swans would join the chant in unison. < ref > [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''On the nature of Animals'' 11. 1 < /ref > \n \n Among the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], the study of mathematics and music were connected to the worship of Apollo, their principal deity. < ref > [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''[[Varia Historia]]'', 2. 26 < /ref > < ref > [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]], 8.13 < /ref > < ref > [[Iamblichus]], ''Vit. Pyth.'' 8.91.141 < /ref >  Their belief was that the music purifies the soul, just as medicine purifies the body. They also believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the mechanics of the cosmos, evolving into an idea known as the [[music of the spheres]]. < ref > Landels, John G (1999) ''Music in Ancient Greece and Rome'' < /ref > \n \n [[File:The music of the spheres.jpg|thumb|The music of the spheres. Shown in this engraving from Renaissance Italy are Apollo, the Muses, the planetary spheres and musical ratios.]] \n \n Apollo appears as the companion of the [[Muses]], and as [[Musagetes]] ( \" leader of Muses \" ) he leads them in dance. They spend their time on [[Parnassus]], which is one of their sacred places. Apollo is also the lover of the Muses and by them he became the father of famous musicians like [[Orpheus]] and [[Linus of Thrace|Linus]]. \n \n Apollo is often found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the [[lyre]]. < ref > Iliad (i. 603) < /ref >  In his role as the god of banquets, he was always present to play music in weddings of the gods, like the marriage of [[Eros]] and [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]. He is a frequent guest of the [[Bacchanalia]], and many ancient ceramics depict him being at ease amidst the [[maenads]] and satyrs. < ref > Detienne, Marcel (2001) ''Forgetting Delphi between Apollo and Dionysus'' < /ref >  Apollo also participated in musical contests when challenged by others. He was the victor in all those contests, but he tended to punish his opponents severely for their [[hubris]]. \n \n [[File:Parnassus, Andrea Appiani (1811).jpg|thumb|Apollo and the Muses on Parnassus, by [[Andrea Appiani]]]] \n \n ====Apollo's lyre==== \n \n The invention of lyre is attributed either to Hermes or to Apollo himself. < ref > {{cite web|title=Homeric Hymn to Hermes (IV, 1-506)|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0138%3ahymn%3d4|website=Perseus|access-date=18 March 2018}} < /ref >  Distinctions have been made that Hermes invented lyre made of tortoise shell, whereas the lyre Apollo invented was a regular lyre. < ref > Diodorus Siculus < /ref > \n \n Myths tell that the infant Hermes stole a number of Apollo's cows and took them to a cave in the woods near [[Pylos]], covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a [[tortoise]] and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made his [[lyre]]. \n \n [[File:No\u00ebl Coypel - Story of Apollo-Apollo and Mercury, 1688.jpg|thumb|The friendship of Apollo and Hermes, by [[No\u00ebl Coypel]]]] \n \n Upon discovering the theft, Apollo confronted Hermes and asked him to return his cattle. When Hermes acted innocent, Apollo took the matter to Zeus. Zeus, having seen the events, sided with Apollo, and ordered Hermes to return the cattle. Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo fell in love with the instrument and offered to exchange the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo then became the master of the lyre. \n \n [[File:Detail of the statue of Apollo holding the kithara, from the Temple of Venus (Casino Fede) at Hadrian's Villa, Ny Carlsberg Glyptoteket (12233881783).jpg|thumb|Detail of Apollo's lyre]] \n \n According to other versions, Apollo had invented the lyre himself, whose strings he tore in repenting of the excess punishment he had given to [[Marsyas]]. Hermes' lyre, therefore, would be a reinvention. < ref > Norman O. Brown, ''Hermes the thief'' < /ref > \n \n ====Contest with Pan==== \n [[File:Laurits Regner Tuxen The-Musical-Dual-Of-Pan-And-Apollo.jpg|thumb|The musical duel of Pan and Apollo, by [[Laurits Tuxen]]]] \n Once [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo and to challenge the god of music to a contest. The mountain-god [[Tmolus (son of Ares)|Tmolus]] was chosen to umpire. Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, [[Midas]], who happened to be present. Then, Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. It was so beautiful that Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and everyone was pleased with the judgement. Only Midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo did not want to suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a [[donkey]]. \n \n ====Contest with Marsyas==== \n [[Marsyas]] was a [[satyr]] who was punished by Apollo for his [[hubris]]. He had found an [[aulos]] on the ground, tossed away after being invented by [[Athena]] because it made her cheeks puffy. Athena had also placed a curse upon the instrument, that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished. When Marsyas played the flute, everyone became frenzied with joy. This led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo, and he challenged the god to a musical contest. The contest was judged by the [[Muse]]s, or the nymphs of [[Nysa (mythology)|Nysa]]. Athena was also present to witness the contest. \n \n [[File:Athena Marsyas.jpg|thumb|[[Athena]] and [[Marsyas]]]] \n \n Marsyas taunted Apollo for  \" wearing his hair long, for having a fair face and smooth body, for his skill in so many arts \" . < ref name= \" Apuleius, Florida 3.2 \" > Apuleius, ''Florida'' 3.2 < /ref >  He also further said, \n \n < blockquote > 'His [Apollo] hair is smooth and made into tufts and curls that fall about his brow and hang before his face. His body is fair from head to foot, his limbs shine bright, his tongue gives oracles, and he is equally eloquent in prose or verse, propose which you will. What of his robes so fine in texture, so soft to the touch, aglow with purple? What of his lyre that flashes gold, gleams white with ivory, and shimmers with rainbow gems? What of his song, so cunning and so sweet? Nay, all these allurements suit with naught save luxury. To virtue they bring shame alone!' < ref name= \" Apuleius, Florida 3.2 \" / > < /blockquote > \n \n The Muses and Athena sniggered at this comment. The contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was that the victor could  \" do whatever he wanted \"  to the loser. \n \n [[File:05apol1.jpg|thumb|The contest between Apollo and [[Marsyas]] by [[Palma il Giovane]]]] \n \n According to one account, after the first round, they both were deemed equal by the [[Nysiads]]. But in the next round, Apollo decided to play on his lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance. Marsyas argued against this, saying that Apollo would have an advantage and accused Apollo of cheating. But Apollo replied that since Marsyas played the flute, which needed air blown from the throat, it was similar to singing, and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all. The nymphs decided that Apollo's argument was just. Apollo then played his lyre and sang at the same time, mesmerising the audience. Marsyas could not do this. Apollo was declared the winner and, angered with Marsyas' haughtiness and his accusations, decided to flay the satyr. < ref name= \" ReferenceD \" > Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 5. 75. 3 < /ref > \n \n According to another account, Marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat. Out of shame, he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack. < ref > Philostratus the Younger, Imagines 2 (trans. Fairbanks) < /ref >  Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument. So the Muses who were the judges declared Apollo the winner. Apollo hung Marsyas from a tree to flay him. < ref > ''Man Myth and Magic'' by Richard Cavendish < /ref > \n \n [[File:Marsyas Flayed by the Order of Apollo - Charles Andr\u00e9 van Loo (1735).jpg|thumb|Marsyas Flayed by the Order of Apollo, by\t[[Charles-Andr\u00e9 van Loo]]]] \n \n Apollo [[flaying|flayed]] the limbs of Marsyas alive in a cave near [[Celaenae]] in [[Phrygia]] for his [[hubris]] to challenge a god. He then gave the rest of his body for proper burial < ref > Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 165 < /ref >  and nailed Marsyas' flayed skin to a nearby pine-tree as a lesson to the others. Marsyas' blood turned into the river Marsyas. But Apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done, he tore the strings of his lyre and threw it away. The lyre was later discovered by the Muses and Apollo's sons [[Linus of Thrace|Linus]] and [[Orpheus]]. The Muses fixed the middle string, Linus the string struck with the forefinger, and Orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it. They took it back to Apollo, but the god, who had decided to stay away from music for a while, laid away both the lyre and the pipes at Delphi and joined [[Cybele]] in her wanderings to as far as [[Hyperborea]]. < ref name= \" ReferenceD \" / > < ref > Apostle Arne Horn, ''The Book of Eusebius'' #4 < /ref > \n \n ====Contest with Cinyras==== \n \n Cinyras was a ruler of [[Cyprus]], who was a friend of [[Agamemnon]]. Cinyras promised to assist Agamemnon in the Trojan war, but did not keep his promise. Agamemnon cursed Cinyras. He invoked Apollo and asked the god to avenge the broken promise. Apollo then had a [[lyre]]-playing contest with [[Cinyras]], and defeated him. Either Cinyras committed suicide when he lost, or was killed by Apollo. < ref > Iliad, 11. 20-23 < /ref > < ref > Eustathius on Iliad; cf. also scholia on the same passage < /ref > \n \n [[File:Apollon Raon Versailles MV5921.jpg|thumb|Apollon Raon, [[Versailles]]]] \n \n ===Patron of sailors=== \n Apollo functions as the patron and protector of sailors, one of the duties he shares with [[Poseidon]]. In the myths, he is seen helping heroes who pray to him for safe journey. \n \n When Apollo spotted a ship of Cretan sailors that was caught in a storm, he quickly assumed the shape of a dolphin and guided their ship safely to Delphi. < ref > Homer, ''Hymn to Pythian Apollo'' < /ref > \n \n When the [[Argonauts]] faced a terrible storm, [[Jason]] prayed to his patron, Apollo, to help them. Apollo used his bow and golden arrow to shed light upon an island, where the Argonauts soon took shelter. This island was renamed  \" [[Anafi|Anaphe]] \" , which means  \" He revealed it \" . < ref > Apollonius of Rhodes, ''Argonautica'' < /ref > \n \n Apollo helped the Greek hero [[Diomedes]], to escape from a great tempest during his journey homeward. As a token of gratitude, Diomedes built a temple in honor of Apollo under the epithet Epibaterius ( \" the embarker \" ). < ref > John Potter, ''Archaeologia Graeca: Or, The Antiquities of Greece, Volume 1'' < /ref > \n \n During the Trojan War, [[Odysseus]] came to the Trojan camp to return Chriseis, the daughter of Apollo's priest [[Chryses]], and brought many offerings to Apollo. Pleased with this, Apollo sent gentle breezes that helped Odysseus return safely to the Greek camp. < ref > Homer, ''the Ilaid'' 1 < /ref > \n \n [[Arion]] was a poet who was kidnapped by some sailors for the rich prizes he possessed. Arion requested them to let him sing for the last time, to which the sailors consented. Arion began singing a song in praise of Apollo, seeking the god's help. Consequently, numerous dolphins surrounded the ship and when Arion jumped into the water, the dolphins carried him away safely. \n \n ===Wars=== \n \n ====Titanomachy==== \n Once [[Hera]], out of spite, aroused the Titans to war against [[Zeus]] and take away his throne. Accordingly, when the Titans tried to climb [[Mount Olympus]], Zeus with the help of Apollo, [[Artemis]] and [[Athena]], defeated them and cast them into tartarus. < ref > Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 150 < /ref > \n \n ====Trojan War==== \n Apollo played a pivotal role in the entire Trojan War. He sided with the Trojans, and sent a terrible plague to the Greek camp, which indirectly led to the conflict between [[Achilles]] and [[Agamemnon]]. He killed the Greek heroes [[Patroclus]], Achilles, and numerous Greek soldiers. He also helped many Trojan heroes, the most important one being [[Hector]]. After the end of the war, Apollo and Poseidon together cleaned the remains of the city and the camps. \n \n [[File:Paris armour Pomarici Santomasi.jpg|thumb|Paris (on the left) putting on his armour as Apollo (on the right) watches him.

The gods Athena and [[Ares]] came to the battlefield and took sides. Athena helped the hero Odysseus while Ares fought alongside of the Brygoi. When Odysseus lost, Athena and Ares came into a direct duel.

Among the warriors was [[Aristaeus]], Apollo's son. Apollo armed his son with his own hands and gave him a bow and arrows and fitted a strong shield to his arm. < ref > Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'' 13 < /ref >  After Zeus urged Apollo to join the war, he went to the battlefield. < ref > Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'' 27 < /ref >  Seeing several of his [[nymphs]] and Aristaeus drowning in a river, he took them to safety and healed them. < ref > Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'' 24 < /ref >  He taught Aristaeus more useful healing arts and sent him back to help the army of Dionysus. \n \n ====Theban war==== \n During the war between the sons of [[Oedipus]], Apollo favored [[Amphiaraus]], a seer and one of the leaders in the war. Though saddened that the seer was fated to be doomed in the war, Apollo made Amphiaraus' last hours glorious by  \" lighting his shield and his helm with starry gleam \" . When [[Hypseus]] tried to kill the hero by a spear, Apollo directed the spear towards the charioteer of Amphiaraus instead. Then Apollo himself replaced the charioteer and took the reins in his hands. He deflected many spears and arrows away them. He also killed many of the enemy warriors like [[Melaneus (mythology)|Melaneus]], [[Antiphus]], Aetion, Polites and [[Lampus]]. At last when the moment of departure came, Apollo expressed his grief with tears in his eyes and bid farewell to Amphiaraus, who was soon engulfed by the Earth. < ref > Statius, ''Thebaid'' 7 < /ref > \n \n ===Slaying of giants=== \n \n Apollo killed the giants Python and Tityos, who had assaulted his mother Leto. \n \n ====Gigantomachy==== \n During the [[gigantomachy]], Apollo killed the giant [[Ephialtes (disambiguation)|Ephialtes]] by shooting him in his eyes.

He captured the old people and children and sent them to his army to hold them for ransom. And he challenged the young and sturdy men to a match of boxing, only to cut their heads off when they would get defeated by him. He hung the chopped off heads to an oak tree.

One day, they were put in charge of watching their father's ancestral wine jar but they fell asleep while performing this duty. While they were asleep, the wine jar was broken by the swines their family kept. When the sisters woke up and saw what had happened, they threw themselves off a cliff in fear of their father's wrath. Apollo, who was passing by, caught them and carried them to two different cities in Chersonesus, Molpadia to Castabus and Parthenos to Bubastus. He turned them into goddesses and they both received divine honors. Molpadia's name was changed to [[Hemithea (mythology)|Hemithea]] upon her deification. < ref > Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, 5. 62. 3-4 < /ref > \n \n ==== Prometheus ==== \n \n [[Prometheus]] was the titan who was punished by Zeus for stealing fire.

Apollo then brought her to the rock of Leukas and asked her to throw herself from the top of the rock. She did so and was freed from her love. When she sought for the reason behind this, Apollo told her that Zeus, before taking another lover, would sit on this rock to free himself from his love to Hera. < ref name= \" ReferenceE \" > Ptolemy Hephaestion, ''New History Book'' 7 < /ref > \n \n Another tale relates that a man named Nireus, who fell in love with the cult statue of Athena, came to the rock and jumped in order relieve himself.

They both united on the day the walls of [[Troy]] were built. She bore to Apollo a son, whom Apollo named Ileus, after the city of his birth, Ilion ([[Troy]]). Ileus was very dear to Apollo. < ref name= \" :7 \" / > \n \n [[Thero (mythology)|Thero]], daughter of [[Phylas]], a maiden as beautiful as the moonbeams, was loved by the radiant Apollo, and she loved him in return.

An [[oracle]] prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive. He was ambushed and killed by [[Achilleus]], and Apollo avenged his death by killing Achilles. After the sack of Troy, Hecuba was taken to Lycia by Apollo. < ref > [[Stesichorus]], Fr.108 < /ref > \n \n [[Coronis (Greek mythology)|Coronis]] was daughter of [[Phlegyas]], King of the [[Lapiths]]. While pregnant with [[Asclepius]], Coronis fell in love with [[Ischys]], son of [[Elatus]] and slept with him. When Apollo found out about her infidelity through his prophetic powers, he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis. Apollo rescued the baby by cutting open Koronis' belly and gave it to the [[centaur]] [[Chiron]] to raise. \n \n [[Dryope (daughter of Dryops)|Dryope]], the daughter of Dryops, was impregnated by Apollo in the form of a snake. She gave birth to a son named Amphissus. < ref > Antoninus Liberalis, ''Metamorphoses'' 32 < /ref > < ref > Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 9.330 < /ref > \n \n In [[Euripides]]' play ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'', Apollo fathered [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] by [[Creusa (daughter of Erechtheus)|Creusa]], wife of [[Xuthus]]. He used his powers to conceal her pregnancy from her father. Later, when Creusa left Ion to die in the wild, Apollo asked [[Hermes]] to save the child and bring him to the oracle at [[Delphi]], where he was raised by a priestess. \n \n ===Male lovers=== \n \n [[File:Cesio, Carlo 1626 - 1686) - Apollo e Giacinto, inc. da Annibale Carracci, -1675-.jpg|thumb|''Apollo and Hyacinthus'', by Carlo Cesio]] \n [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]] or Hyacinthus was one of Apollo's favorite lovers. < ref > [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 10 < /ref >  He was a [[Sparta]]n prince, beautiful and athletic. The pair was practicing throwing the [[Discus throw|discus]] when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous [[Zephyrus]] and struck Hyacinthus in the head, killing him instantly. Apollo is said to be filled with grief. Out of Hyacinthus' blood, Apollo created a [[hyacinth (plant)|flower]] named after him as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f30\u03b1\u1fd6}}, meaning ''alas''. < ref > {{LSJ|ai)ai{{=}}|\u03b1\u1f30\u03b1\u1fd6}}, {{LSJ|ai)/2|\u03b1\u1f34|shortref}}. < /ref >  He was later resurrected and taken to heaven.

Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a [[Pilum|javelin]] as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus was so saddened by its death that he asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo granted the request by turning him into the [[Cupressaceae|Cypress]] named after him, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk. \n \n [[File:Granger-Apollo.jpg|thumb|Apollo and Cyparissus, by Jean-Pierre Granger (1779\u20131840)]] \n \n [[Admetus]], the king of Pherae, was also Apollo's lover. < ref > [[Callimachus]], Hymn to Apollo, 49. < /ref > < ref name= \" Plutarch, Numa \" > [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Numa'', 4. 5. < /ref >  During his exile, which lasted either for one year or nine years, < ref > {{Cite journal|last=Keaveney|first=Arthur|date=1984-01-01|journal=Philologus|volume=128|issue=1\u20132|doi=10.1524/phil.1984.128.12.138|issn=2196-7008|title=A Note on Servius, Ad ''Aeneid'' 7, 637|s2cid=164720549}} < /ref >  Apollo served Admetus as a herdsman.

This satisfied Alcestis' father and he let Admetus marry his daughter. Further, Apollo saved the king from Artemis' wrath and also convinced the [[Moirai]] to postpone Admetus' death once. \n \n [[Branchus]], a shepherd, one day came across Apollo in the woods. Captivated by the god's beauty, he kissed Apollo. Apollo requited his affections and wanting to reward him, bestowed prophetic skills on him.

His children grew up to be physicians, musicians, poets, seers or archers. Many of his sons founded new cities and became kings. They were all usually very beautiful. \n \n [[File:1590. Apollo Entrusting Chiron with the Education of Aescalapius - etching - Washington DC, NGA.jpg|thumb|Apollo Entrusting [[Chiron]] with the Education of Aescalapius]] \n \n [[Asclepius]] is the most famous son of Apollo. His skills as a physician surpassed that of Apollo's. Zeus killed him for bringing back the dead, but upon Apollo's request, he was resurrected as a god.  \n [[Aristaeus]] was placed under the care of Chiron after his birth. He became the god of beekeeping, cheese making, animal husbandry and more. He was ultimately given immortality for the benefits he bestowed upon the humanity. The [[Corybantes]] were spear-clashing, dancing demigods. \n \n The sons of Apollo who participated in the Trojan War include the Trojan princes [[Hector]] and [[Troilus]], as well as [[Tenes]], the king of [[Tenedos]], all three of whom were killed by Achilles over the course of the war. \n \n Apollo's children who became musicians and bards include [[Orpheus]], [[Linus (mythology)|Linus]], [[Ialemus]], [[Hymen (god)|Hymen]]aeus, [[Philammon]], [[Eumolpus]] and [[Eleuther]]. Apollo fathered 3 daughters, [[Apollonis]], [[Borysthenis]] and [[Cephisso]], who formed a group of minor Muses, the  \" Musa Apollonides \" . They were nicknamed Nete, Mese and Hypate after the highest, middle and lowest strings of his lyre. < ref > {{Cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/MousaiApollonides.html | title=MUSES APOLLONIDES (Mousai) - Greek Goddesses of Music}} < /ref >  [[Phemonoe]] was a seer and a poetess who was the inventor of Hexameter. \n \n [[Apis (Greek mythology)|Apis]], [[Idmon]], [[Iamus]], [[Tenerus (son of Apollo)|Tenerus]], [[Mopsus]], [[Themisto (disambiguation)|Galeus]], Telmessus and others were gifted seers. [[Anius]], Pythaeus and [[Ismenus]] lived as high priests.

Apollo turned Parthenos into a constellation after her early death. \n \n Additionally, Apollo fostered and educated [[Chiron]], the centaur who later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods, including Apollo's sons. Apollo also fostered [[Carnus]], the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]]. \n \n ===Failed love attempts=== \n \n [[Marpessa]] was kidnapped by [[Idas]] but was loved by Apollo as well. [[Zeus]] made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old. \n \n [[Sinope (mythology)|Sinope]], a nymph, was approached by the amorous Apollo. She made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask for, and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin. Apollo kept his promise and went back. \n \n [[Bolina]] was admired by Apollo but she refused him and jumped into the sea. To avoid her death, Apollo turned her into a nymph and let her go. \n \n [[Castalia]] was a [[nymph]] whom Apollo loved. She fled from him and dove into the [[castalian Spring|spring]] at Delphi, at the base of [[Mt. Parnassos]], which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses. \n \n [[Cassandra]], was a daughter of Hecuba and Priam. Apollo wished to court her. Cassandra promised to return his love on one condition - he should give her the power to see the future. Apollo fulfilled her wish, but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after. Angered that she broke her promise, Apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future, no one would ever believe her prophecies. \n \n [[Hestia]], the goddess of the hearth, rejected both Apollo's and Poseidon's marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried. \n \n ====Consorts and children: extended list==== \n {| class= \" wikitable \" \n |+Comparative table of Apollo's family \n !Consort \n !Children \n !Consort \n !Children \n !Loved / Wooed \n |- \n | rowspan= \" 7 \"  |[[Acacallis (mythology)|Acacallis]] \n |\u2022 [[Amphithemis]] ([[Garamas]]) < ref > [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 1491 ff < /ref > \n |[[Hypermnestra#Daughter of Thestius and Eurythemis|Hypermnestra]] \n |\u2022 [[Amphiaraus]] \n |\u2022 [[Amphissa of Locris|Amphissa / Isse]] \n |- \n |\u2022 [[Caphauras]] < ref name= \" :5 \" > {{Cite book|title=A Classical Manual, being a Mythological, Historical and Geographical Commentary on Pope's Homer, and Dryden's Aeneid of Virgil with a Copious Index|last=Murray|first=John|year=1833|location=Albemarle Street, London|page=18}} < /ref > \n |[[Hyria (mythology)|Hyria]] ([[Thyria (mythology)|Thyria]]) \n |\u2022 [[Cycnus#Son of Apollo|Cycnus]] \n |\u2022 [[Cassandra]] ''(unsuccessful)'' \n |- \n |\u2022 [[Miletus (mythology)|Miletus]] \n | rowspan= \" 2 \"  |[[Hecuba]] \n |\u2022 [[Troilus]] \n |\u2022 [[Bolina]] ''(unsuccessful)'' \n |- \n |\u2022 [[Naxos (mythology)|Naxos]] < ref > [[eponym]] of the island [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]] < /ref > < ref > [[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 1491 ff < /ref > \n |\u2022 [[Hector]] < ref > [[Stesichorus]], Fr. 108; [[Tzetzes]], ''On Lycophron''; Porphyry in his ''Omissions'' states that [[Ibycus]], [[Alexander Aetolus|Alexander]], [[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorion]] and [[Lycophron]] all made Hector the son of Apollo. < /ref > \n |\u2022 [[Castalia]] ''(unsuccessful)'' \n |- \n |\u2022 [[Oaxes]] < ref name= \" :4 \" > [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] on [[Virgil]]'s Eclogue 1, 65 < /ref > < ref > [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], ''Ethnica'' s.v.

The version given in scholia on Pausanias has prompted several scholars to emend  \" Euxippe \"  to  \" Zeuxippe \" , and to assume that  \" \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \"  refers to Apollo rather than Acraepheus. Such an interpretation, however, has been contested on the strength of the facts that Stephanus must have closely followed Herodianus, where the parents' names are unambiguously Acraepheus and Euxippe, and that the passage in scholia on Pausanias allows for an alternate understanding that doesn't necessarily make Apollo and Zeuxippe parents of Ptous.

In the pre-Hellenic period, their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife, and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described Artemis as the wife of Apollo.

They both are cousins, since their mothers - [[Leto]] and [[Asteria (Titaness)|Asteria]] - are sisters. One of Apollo's epithets, ''Hecatos'', is the masculine form of Hecate, and both the names mean  \" working from afar \" .

Being Zeus' favorite children, they were given more powers and duties. Apollo and Athena often took up the role as protectors of cities, and were patrons of some of the important cities. Athena was the principle goddess of [[Athens]], Apollo was the principle god of [[Sparta]]. < ref > {{Cite web | url=https://publicism.info/culture/apollo/7.html | title=APOLLO, THE YOUNG, AND THE CITY - KEY THEMES - Apollo - Fritz Graf}} < /ref > \n \n [[File:Houbraken, Arnold - Pallas Athene Visiting Apollo on the Parnassus - 1703.jpeg|thumb|Pallas Athene Visiting Apollo on the Parnassus, by [[Arnold Houbraken]]]] \n \n As patrons of arts, Apollo and Athena were companions of the [[Muses]], the former a much more frequent companion than the latter. < ref > Peter Dawkins, ''The Shakespeare Enigma'' < /ref >  Apollo was sometimes called the son of Athena and Hephaestus due to his wise and artistic nature. < ref > {{Cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/Athena.html | title=ATHENA - Greek Goddess of Wisdom, War  &  Crafts}} < /ref > \n \n In the Trojan war, as Zeus' executive, Apollo is seen holding the [[aegis]] like Athena usually does. < ref > Homer, Iliad 15.308 < /ref >  Apollo's decisions were usually approved by his sister Athena, and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by Zeus. < ref > 1.Homer, ''Iliad'', Euripides, ''Ion'', Aeschylus, ''Oresteia'' < /ref > \n \n ===Apollo in the ''Oresteia''=== \n In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia]]'' trilogy, [[Clytemnestra]] kills her husband, King [[Agamemnon]] because he had sacrificed their daughter [[Iphigenia]] to proceed forward with the Trojan war. Apollo gives an order through the Oracle at Delphi that Agamemnon's son, [[Orestes]], is to kill Clytemnestra and [[Aegisthus]], her lover. Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently Orestes is pursued by the [[Erinyes]] or Furies (female personifications of [[revenge|vengeance]]). \n \n Apollo and the Furies argue about whether the [[matricide]] was justified; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father, whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage. They invade his temple, and he drives them away. He says that the matter should be brought before Athena. Apollo promises to protect Orestes, as Orestes has become Apollo's [[Supplication|supplicant]]. Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial, and ultimately Athena rules in favor of Apollo. \n \n ===Roman Apollo=== \n \n The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks.{{sfn|Freese|1911|p=185}} As a quintessentially [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek god]], Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent, although later Roman poets often referred to him as '''Phoebus'''. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Koronis.html |title=Koronis |publisher=Theoi |access-date=30 July 2013}} < /ref >  There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the [[Roman Kingdom|kings of Rome]] during the reign of [[Tarquinius Superbus]]. < ref > [[Livy]] [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Liv.+1.56 1.56]. < /ref > \n \n On the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE, Apollo's [[Temple of Apollo Sosianus|first temple]] at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the  \" Apollinare \" . < ref > Livy [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0026:book=3:chapter=63 3.63.7], [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0145:book=4:chapter=25 4.25.3]. < /ref >  During the [[Second Punic War]] in 212 BCE, the ''[[Ludi Apollinares]]'' ( \" Apollonian Games \" ) were instituted in his honor, on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius. < ref > Livy [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0147:book=25:chapter=12 25.12]. < /ref >  In the time of [[Augustus]], who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome. < ref > {{cite book |author=J.

According to Greek tradition, he helped [[Crete|Cretan]] or [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]]n colonists found the city of [[Troy]]. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts mention an Asia Minor god called ''Appaliunas'' or ''Apalunas'' in connection with the city of [[Wilusa]] attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek [[Troy|Ilion]] by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo's title of ''Lykegenes'' can simply be read as  \" born in Lycia \" , which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a [[folk etymology]]). \n \n In literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reason\u2014characteristics contrasted with those of [[Dionysus]], god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives [[Apollonian and Dionysian]]. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for [[Hyperborea]], he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the [[Borghese Vase]]. \n \n Apollo is often associated with the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|Golden Mean]]. This is the Greek [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of [[moderation]] and a [[virtue]] that opposes [[gluttony]]. \n \n ==Apollo in the arts== \n [[File:7262 - Piraeus Arch.

The earliest Greek word for a statue is  \" delight \"  ({{lang|grc|\u1f04\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1}}, ''agalma''), and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision. Greek art puts into Apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined. The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} \n \n The naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity. The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment. The statues of Apollo embody beauty, balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} \n \n ===Archaic sculpture=== \n Numerous free-standing statues of male youths from [[Archaic Greece]] exist, and were once thought to be representations of Apollo, though later discoveries indicated that many represented mortals. < ref > Delphi, 467, 1524 < /ref >  In 1895, V.
