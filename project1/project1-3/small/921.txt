Despite extensive [[Crude oil|oil and gas]] resources, diamonds, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] potential, and rich agricultural land, Angola remains poor, and a third of the population relies on subsistence agriculture.

[[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded S\u0101o Paulo de Loanda ([[Luanda]]) in 1575. S\u00e3o Felipe de Benguella ([[Benguela]]) followed in 1587. \n \n The principal early trade was in [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]]. Portuguese merchants purchased the slaves from the local [[Imbangala]] and [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]] peoples, [[Slavery in Africa|notable slave hunters]], and sold them to the [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s in [[Captaincies of Brazil|Brazil]]. Brazilian ships were frequent visitors to Luanda and Benguela and Angola functioned as a kind of colony of Brazil, with Brazilian [[Jesuits]] active in its religious and educational centers. \n \n The [[Portuguese Empire]] was neglected during the period of the [[Iberian Union]], which lasted from 1580 to 1640. The Dutch, bitter enemies of their former masters in [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], invaded many Portuguese overseas possessions. During Portugal's separatist war against Spain, the Dutch occupied Luanda from 1640 to 1648, calling it  \" Fort Aardenburgh \" . The Dutch used the territory to supply their own slaves to the sugarcane plantations of [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] ([[Pernambuco]], [[Olinda]], [[Recife]]), which they had also seized from Portugal. [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]], conquered the Portuguese possessions of [[Elmina|Saint George del Mina]], Saint Thomas, and Luanda, Angola, on the west coast of Africa. Portugal recovered the territory between 1648 and 1650. \n \n In the high plains, the Planalto, the most important native states were [[Bi\u00e9 Province|Bi\u00e9]] and [[Bailundo]], the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. Portugal expanded into their territory,{{when|date=June 2015}} but did not control much of the interior prior to the late 19th century.{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=45}} \n \n The Portuguese started to develop townships, trading posts, logging camps and small processing factories. From 1764 onwards,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} there was a gradual change from a slave-based society to one based on production for domestic consumption and export. Following the [[independence of Brazil]] in 1822, the slave trade was formally abolished in 1836. However it did continue locally into the 20th century. In 1844, Angola's ports were opened to foreign shipping. \n \n By 1850, Luanda was one of the greatest and most developed Portuguese cities in the vast [[Portuguese Empire]] outside of [[Mainland Portugal]],{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} full of trading companies,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} exporting peanut oil,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} copal,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} timber,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and cocoa.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The principal exports of the post-slave economy in the 19th century were rubber, beeswax, and ivory.{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=45}} Maize, tobacco, dried meat and [[cassava]] flour also began to be locally produced.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Prior to the [[First World War]], exportation of coffee, [[palm tree|palm]] kernels and [[palm oil|oil]], cattle, leather and [[Hide (skin)|hides]], and [[salt fish]] joined the principal exports, with small quantities of gold and cotton also being produced. < ref > {{cite EB1911|wstitle=Angola |volume=2 |page=39}} < /ref >  Grains, sugar, and rum were also produced for local consumption.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=39}} The principal imports were foodstuffs, cotton goods, hardware, and British coal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=39}} Legislation against foreign traders was implemented in the 1890s. The territory's prosperity, however, continued to depend on plantations worked by labor  \" indentured \"  from the interior.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=40}} \n \n From the 1920s to the 1960s, strong economic growth, abundant natural resources and development of infrastructure, led to the arrival of even more Portuguese settlers.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Petroleum was known to exist as early as the mid-19th century,{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=45}} but modern exploitation didn't begin until in 1955.

[[Mobutu Sese Seko]], the [[President of Zaire]], met with [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]], the transitional [[President of Portugal]], on September 15, 1974, on [[Sal island]] in Cape Verde, crafting a plan to empower [[Holden Roberto]] of the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]], [[Jonas Savimbi]] of [[UNITA]], and [[Daniel Chipenda]] of the [[MPLA]]'s eastern faction at the expense of MPLA leader [[Agostinho Neto]] while retaining the fa\u00e7ade of national unity. Mobutu and Sp\u00ednola wanted to present Chipenda as the MPLA head, Mobutu particularly preferring Chipenda over Neto because Chipenda supported autonomy for [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]]. The Angolan [[exclave]] has immense petroleum reserves estimated at around 300 million tons (~300{{e|9}} & nbsp;kg) which Zaire, and thus the Mobutu government, depended on for economic survival. < ref name= \" petroleum \" > Erik P.

The protocol prohibited [[UNITA]] from buying foreign arms, a provision the United Nations largely did not enforce, so both sides continued to build up their stockpile. UNITA purchased weapons in 1996 and 1997 from private sources in [[Albania]] and [[Bulgaria]], and from [[Zaire]], South Africa, [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Zambia]], [[Togo]], and [[Burkina Faso]]. In October 1997 the UN imposed travel sanctions on UNITA leaders, but the UN waited until July 1998 to limit UNITA's exportation of diamonds and freeze UNITA bank accounts. While the U.S. government gave US$250 & nbsp;million to UNITA between 1986 and 1991, UNITA made US$1.72 & nbsp;billion between 1994 and 1999 exporting diamonds, primarily through Zaire to Europe. At the same time the Angolan government received large amounts of weapons from the governments of [[Belarus]], Brazil, Bulgaria, China, and South Africa. While no arms shipment to the government violated the protocol, no country informed the U.N. Register on Conventional Weapons as required. < ref name= \" lusaka \" > Vines, Alex.

Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports. Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed {{convert|1.4|Moilbbl/d}} in late-2005 and which is expected to grow to {{convert|2|Moilbbl/d}} by 2007. Control of the oil industry is consolidated in [[Sonangol Group]], a conglomerate owned by the Angolan government. With revenues booming from oil exports, the government has started to implement ambitious development programs to build roads and other basic infrastructure for the nation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} \n \n In the last decade of the colonial period, Angola was a major African food exporter but now imports almost all its food. Severe wartime conditions, including extensive planting of landmines throughout the countryside, have brought agricultural activities to a near-standstill. Some efforts to recover have gone forward, however, notably in fisheries. Coffee production, though a fraction of its pre-1975 level, is sufficient for domestic needs and some exports. Expanding oil production is now almost half of GDP and 90% of exports, at {{convert|800|koilbbl/d}}. Diamonds provided much of the revenue for [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s [[UNITA]] rebellion through illicit trade. Other rich resources await development: gold, forest products, fisheries, iron ore, coffee, and fruits. < ref > {{Cite web|title=Angola - The World Factbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/angola/#economy|access-date=2021-03-09|website=www.cia.gov}} < /ref > \n \n This is a chart of trend of [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal]] gross domestic product of Angola at market prices using International Monetary Fund data; < ref name= \" gdptrend \" > {{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcoutm.cfm?SD=1995 & ED=2005 & R1=1 & R2=1 & CS=3 & SS=2 & OS=C & DD=0 & OUT=1 & C=614 & S=NGDP-NGDPD & RequestTimeout=120 & CMP=0 |title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects |publisher=Imf.org |date=April 2, 2003|access-date=July 13, 2014}} < /ref >  figures are in millions of units. \n {|class= \" wikitable \" \n |- \n !Year || Gross Domestic Product (*$1,000,000) || US Dollar Exchange || Per Capita Income < br/ >  (as % of USA) \n |- \n |1980 || || || 6.33 \n |- \n |1985 || || || 4.46 \n |- \n |1990 || || || 4.42 \n |- \n |1995 || 5,066 || 14 Angolan Kwanza || 1.58 \n |- \n |2000 || 9,135 || 91,666 Angolan Kwanza || 1.96 \n |- \n |2005 || 28,860 || 2,515,452 Angolan Kwanza || 4.73 \n |} \n \n The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.
