Their importance is considered equal to those of the [[Carlo Bergonzi (luthier)|Bergonzi]], [[Guarneri]], and [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]] families. Today, violins created by Nicol\u00f2 Amati are valued at around $600,000. < ref > [http://www.violinadvisor.com/pricehistory.htm Violin Price Histories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717210444/http://www.violinadvisor.com/pricehistory.htm |date=2011-07-17 }}, violinadvisor.com, accessed 18 martie 2014 < /ref >  Because of their age and rarity, Amati instruments are mostly kept in museum or private collections and are seldom played in public. \n \n ==Family members== \n \n ===Andrea Amati=== \n {{main|Andrea Amati}} \n '''Andrea Amati''' ({{circa|1505}}{{snd}}December 20, 1577) designed and created the violin, viola and cello known as the  \" violin family \" . He standardized the basic form, shape, size, materials and method of construction. Makers from nearby [[Brescia]] experimented, such as Gasparo da Sal\u00f2, Micheli, Zanetto and Pellegrino, but it was Andrea Amati in Cremona, Italy, who gave the modern violin family their definitive profile. \n \n The first violin was ordered by [[Lorenzo De Medici|Lorenzo de' Medici]] in 1555. His letter to Amati stated the instrument was to be  \" made of the highest quality materials like that of a lute, but simple to play \" . What became of this first violin is not known. A number of his instruments survived for some time, dating between 1538 (Amati made the first Cello called  \" The King \"  in 1538 [1]{{Clarify|date=January 2018}} < !--Does this bracketed number mean the first instrument Amati produced in that year, January [or possibly March, considering that Italian years at the time were often reckoned as starting in that month], or is it an artifact from a cut-and-paste job from a possibly copyrighted webpage?-- > ) and 1574. The largest number these are from 1560, a set for an entire orchestra of 38 ordered by [[Catherine De Medici|Catherine de M\u00e9dicis]] the regent queen of France and bore hand painted royal French decorations in gold including the motto and coat of arms of her son [[Charles IX of France]]. Of these 38 instruments ordered, Amati created violins of two sizes, violas of two sizes and large-sized cellos. They were in use until the French revolution of 1789 and only 14 of these instruments survived. His work is marked by selection of the finest materials, great elegance in execution, soft clear amber, soft translucent varnish, and an in depth use of acoustic and geometrical principles in design. \n < ref > Dilworth, John.

They are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of [[viola]], in contrast to older tenor violas, but the widespread belief that they were the first ones to do so is incorrect given that [[Gasparo da Salo]] made violas ranging from altos of 39 & nbsp;cm to tenors of 44.7 & nbsp;cm. \n \n ===Nicolo Amati=== \n {{main|Nicol\u00f2 Amati}} \n '''Nicol\u00f2 Amati''' (December 3, 1596{{snd}}April 12, 1684) was the son of Girolamo Amati. He was the most eminent of the family. He improved the model adopted by the rest of the Amatis and produced instruments capable of yielding greater power of [[timbre|tone]]. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" > {{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amati|volume=1|page=783}} < /ref >  His pattern was unusually small, but he also made a wider model now known as the  \" Grand Amati \" , which have become his most sought-after violins. \n \n Of his pupils, the most famous were [[Antonio Stradivari]] and [[Andrea Guarneri]], < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  the first of the Guarneri family of violin makers. (There is much controversy regarding the apprenticeship of Antonio Stradivari. While the label on Stradivari's first known violin states that he was a pupil of Amati, the validity of his statement is questioned.) \n \n === Girolamo Amati (Hieronymus II) === \n The last maker of the family was Nicol\u00f2's son, [[Girolamo Amati]], known as '''Hieronymus II''' (February 26, 1649{{snd}}February 21, 1740). He improved the arching of his father's instruments.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=July 2012}} \n \n ==Extant Amati instruments== \n \n Amati instruments include some of the oldest extant examples of the violin family, dating to as far back as the mid-16th century.
