Under the influence of [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]] (1827\u20131907), he opposed any reform that limited his autocratic rule. During his reign, Russia fought no major wars; he was therefore styled  \" '''The Peacemaker''' \"  ({{lang-rus|\u041c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446|Mirotvorets|p=m\u02b2\u026ar\u0250\u02c8tvor\u02b2\u026at\u0361s}}). \n \n ==Personality== \n [[File:Tsarevitch Alexander later Alexander III 1865 by Sergei Levitsky.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Alexander III as [[Tsesarevich]], by [[Sergei Lvovich Levitsky]], 1865]] \n \n Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich was born on 10 March 1845 at the [[Winter Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire]], the second son and third child of [[Emperor of Russia#Emperors of Russia|Emperor]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] and his first wife [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Maria Alexandrovna]] (n\u00e9e Princess Marie of Hesse). \n \n In disposition, Alexander bore little resemblance to his soft-hearted, liberal father, and still less to his refined, philosophic, sentimental, chivalrous, yet cunning great-uncle [[Emperor Alexander I]], who could have been given the title of  \" the first gentleman of [[Europe]] \" . Although an enthusiastic amateur musician and patron of the [[ballet]], Alexander was seen as lacking refinement and elegance. Indeed, he rather relished the idea of being of the same rough texture as some of his subjects. His straightforward, abrupt manner savoured sometimes of gruffness, while his direct, unadorned method of expressing himself harmonized well with his rough-hewn, immobile features and somewhat sluggish movements. His education was not such as to soften these peculiarities.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|pp=561-562}} \n \n Alexander was 190.5 cm (six foot three inches) tall. < ref name= \" Kiste, 1959, p. 101 \" > John Van der Kiste, \u201cThe Romanovs 1818-1959, \"  p. 101 < /ref >  A [[sebaceous cyst]] on the left side of his nose caused him to be mocked by some of his contemporaries, and he sat for photographs and portraits with the right side of his face most prominent. \n \n Alexander was extremely strong. He tore packs of cards in half with his bare hands to entertain his children. < ref name= \" Kiste, 1959, p. 101 \" / >  When the Austrian ambassador in [[St. Petersburg]] said that [[Austria]] would mobilize two or three army corps against Russia, he twisted a silver fork into a knot and threw it onto the plate of the ambassador. < ref name= \" Kiste, 1959, p. 132 \" > John Van der Kiste, \u201cThe Romanovs 1818-1959, \"  p. 132 < /ref >  He said,  \" That is what I am going to do to your two or three army corps. \" < ref name= \" Kiste, 1959, p. 132 \" / > \n \n Unlike his extroverted [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|wife]], Alexander disliked social functions and avoided St. Petersburg. At palace balls, he was impatient for the events to end. He would order each musician of the orchestra to leave and turn off the lights until the guests left. < ref name= \" Kiste, 1959, p. 132 \" / > \n \n Alexander was afraid of horses. In his childhood, he had had an unpleasant experience on a bad-tempered mount. < ref name= \" Kiste, 1959, p. 133 \" > John Van der Kiste, \u201cThe Romanovs 1818-1959, \"  p. 133 < /ref >  His wife once convinced him to go on a carriage ride with her. As he reluctantly entered the carriage, the ponies reared back. He immediately left the carriage and no amount of pleading from his wife could convince him to get back in. < ref name= \" Kiste, 1959, p. 133 \" / > \n \n An account from the memoirs of the artist [[Alexander Benois]] gives one impression of Alexander III: \n \n < blockquote > After a performance of the ballet ''[[Tsar Kandavl or Le Roi Candaule|Tsar Kandavl]]'' at the [[Mariinsky Theatre]], I first caught sight of the Emperor. I was struck by the size of the man, and although cumbersome and heavy, he was still a mighty figure. There was indeed something of the [[muzhik]] ''[Russian peasant]'' about him. The look of his bright eyes made quite an impression on me. As he passed where I was standing, he raised his head for a second, and to this day I can remember what I felt as our eyes met. It was a look as cold as steel, in which there was something threatening, even frightening, and it struck me like a blow. The Tsar's gaze! The look of a man who stood above all others, but who carried a monstrous burden and who every minute had to fear for his life and the lives of those closest to him. In later years I came into contact with the Emperor on several occasions, and I felt not the slightest bit timid. In more ordinary cases Tsar Alexander III could be at once kind, simple, and even almost homely. < /blockquote > \n \n ==Early life== \n Though he was destined to be a strongly counter-reforming emperor, Alexander had little prospect of succeeding to the throne during the first two decades of his life, as he had an elder brother, [[Grand Duke Nicholas Alexandrovich of Russia|Nicholas]], who seemed of robust constitution. Even when Nicholas first displayed symptoms of delicate health, the notion that he might die young was never taken seriously, and he was betrothed to [[Dagmar of Denmark (Maria Feodorovna)|Princess Dagmar of Denmark]], daughter of [[King Christian IX of Denmark]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise of Denmark]], and whose siblings included [[King Frederick VIII of Denmark]], [[Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom]] and [[King George I of Greece]]. Great solicitude was devoted to the education of Nicholas as [[tsesarevich]], whereas Alexander received only the training of an ordinary Grand Duke of that period. This included acquaintance with [[French language|French]], English and [[German language|German]], and [[military drill]].{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}} \n \n ==As Tsarevich== \n [[File:Alexander III and Maria Fedorovna's coronation by G.Becker (1888, Hermitage).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Grand painting by artist Georges Becker of the coronation of Emperor Alexander III and [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Empress Maria Fyodorovna]], which took place on {{OldStyleDate|27 May|1883|15 May}} at the [[Cathedral of the Dormition|Uspensky Sobor]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]]. On the left of the [[dais]] can be seen his young son and heir, [[Nicholas II of Russia|the Tsarevich Nicholas]], and behind Nicholas can be seen a young [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke George]].]] \n Alexander became [[tsesarevich]] upon Nicholas's sudden death in 1865. He had been very close to his older brother, and he was devastated by Nicholas' death. When he became tsar, he reflected that \u201cno one had such an impact on my life as my dear brother and friend Nixa [Nicholas] \" < ref > Simon Sebag Montefiore, The Romanovs, p. 407 < /ref >  and lamented that  \" a terrible responsibility fell on my shoulders \"  when Nicholas died. \n \n As tsesarevich, Alexander began to study the principles of law and administration under [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], then a professor of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] at [[Moscow State University]] and later (from 1880) [[chief procurator]] of the [[Holy Synod]] of the Orthodox Church in Russia. Pobedonostsev instilled into the young man's mind the belief that zeal for [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] thought was an essential factor of Russian [[patriotism]] to be cultivated by every right-minded emperor. While he was [[heir apparent]] from 1865 to 1881 Alexander did not play a prominent part in public affairs, but allowed it to become known that he had ideas which did not coincide with the principles of the existing government.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}} \n \n On his deathbed, Nicholas allegedly expressed the wish that his fianc\u00e9e, Princess Dagmar of Denmark, should marry Alexander.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}} Alexander's parents encouraged the match. On 2 June 1866, Alexander went to Copenhagen to visit Dagmar. When they were looking at photographs of the deceased Nicholas, Alexander proposed to Dagmar. < ref > Simon Sebag Montefiore, The Romanovs, p. 409 < /ref >  On {{OldStyleDate|9 November|1866|28 October}} in the [[Grand Church of the Winter Palace]] in [[St. Petersburg]], Alexander wed Dagmar, who converted to Orthodox Christianity and took the name [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Feodorovna]]. The union proved a happy one to the end; unlike nearly all of his predecessors since Peter I, there was no adultery in his marriage. The couple spent their wedding night at the Tsarevich's private dacha known as  \" My Property \" . \n \n Alexander and his father became estranged due to their different political views. In 1870, Alexander II supported Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War, which angered Alexander. Influenced by his Danish wife Dagmar, Alexander criticized the  \" shortsighted government \"  for helping the  \" Prussian pigs. \" < ref > Simon Sebag Montefiore, The Romanovs, p. 415 < /ref > \n \n Alexander resented his father for having a long-standing relationship with [[Catherine Dolgorukov]] (with whom he had several illegitimate children) while his mother, the [[Marie Alexandrovna, Tsarina of Russia|Empress]], was suffering from chronic ill-health. < ref > Van Der Kiste, John ''The Romanovs: 1818\u20131959 ''(Sutton Publishing, 2003) p. 94 < /ref >  Two days after Empress Marie died, his father told him, \u201cI shall live as I wish, and my union with Princess Dolgorukaya is definite \"  but assured him that  \" your rights will be safeguarded.\u201d < ref > Simon Sebag Montefiore, The Romanovs, p. 441 < /ref >  Alexander was furious over his father's decision to marry Catherine a month after his mother's death, which he believed \u201cforever ruined all the dear good memories of family life.\u201d < ref > Simon Sebag Montefiore, The Romanovs, p. 442 < /ref >  His father threatened to disinherit him if he left court out of protest against the marriage. < ref > Simon Sebag Montefiore, The Romanovs, p. 445 < /ref >  He privately denounced Catherine as  \" the outsider \"  and complained that she was  \" designing and immature. \" < ref > John Van der Kiste, \u201cThe Romanovs 1818-1959, \"  p. 86 < /ref >  After his father's assassination, he reflected that his father's marriage to Catherine had caused the tragedy: \u201cAll the scum burst out and swallowed all that was holy. The guardian angel flew away and everything turned to ashes, finally culminating in the dreadful incomprehensible 1 March. \" < ref > Simon Sebag Montefiore, The Romanovs, p. 451 < /ref > \n \n ==Reign== \n On 13 March 1881 (N.S.) Alexander's father, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], was [[Assassination of Alexander II of Russia|assassinated]] by members of the [[extremist]] organization [[Narodnaya Volya]]. As a result, he ascended to the Russian imperial throne in [[Ninasi|Nennal]]. He and Maria Feodorovna were officially crowned and anointed at the [[Assumption Cathedral in Moscow]] on 27 May 1883. Alexander's ascension to the throne was followed by an outbreak of [[Pogroms in the Russian Empire#1881|anti-Jewish riots]]. < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1132-alexander-iii-alexandrovich-emperor-of-russia|title=ALEXANDER III., ALEXANDROVICH, Emperor of Russia - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}} < /ref > < ref > [http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/annoshow?call=dib|18830607|1|100.0|0  \" Die Judenverfolgung in Ru\u00dfland in der Kr\u00f6nungswoche \" ] (in German), ''[[Das interessante Blatt]]'', 7 June 1883. < /ref > < ref > [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1883/06/01/102825816.pdf  \" Rioting and Politics in Russia \" ], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 June 1883. < /ref > < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Pogroms|title=YIVO - Pogroms|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org}} < /ref > \n [[File:Alexander-Maria.jpg|thumb|Alexander and his wife [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Empress Maria Fyodorovna]] on holiday in [[Copenhagen]] in 1893]] \n \n Alexander III disliked the extravagance of the rest of his family. It was also expensive for the Crown to pay so many grand dukes each year. Each one received an annual salary of 250,000 rubles, and grand duchesses received a dowry of a million when they married. He limited the title of grand duke and duchess to only children and male-line grandchildren of emperors. The rest would bear a princely title and the style of [[Serene Highness]]. He also forbade [[morganatic marriage]]s, as well as those outside of the Orthodoxy. < ref > Sebag Montefiore, p. 668 < /ref > \n \n ===Domestic policies=== \n [[File:Alexander III reception by Repin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Alexander receiving rural district elders in the yard of [[Petrovsky Palace]] in Moscow; painting by [[Ilya Repin]]]] \n \n On the day of his assassination, Alexander II had signed an [[ukaz]] setting up consultative commissions to advise the monarch. On ascending to the throne, however, Alexander III took Pobedonostsev's advice and cancelled the policy before its publication. He made it clear that his [[autocracy]] would not be limited. \n \n All of Alexander III's internal reforms aimed to reverse the liberalization that had occurred in his father's reign. The new Emperor believed that remaining true to Russian [[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality]] (the ideology introduced by his grandfather, emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]) would save Russia from revolutionary agitation. < ref > {{Cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/czar-alexander-iii.htm|title=Alexander III (1881-94)|website=Global Security}} < /ref > \n \n Alexander weakened the power of the ''[[zemstvo]]'' (elective local administrative bodies) and placed the administration of peasant communes under the supervision of land-owning proprietors appointed by his government. These  \" land captains \"  (''zemskiye nachalniki'') were feared and resented throughout the Empire's peasant communities.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} These acts weakened the nobility and the peasantry and brought Imperial administration under the Emperor's personal control. In such policies Alexander III followed the advice of [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], who retained control of the Church in Russia through his long tenure as Procurator of the Holy Synod (from 1880 to 1905) and who became tutor to Alexander's son and heir, Nicholas. (Pobedonostsev appears as  \" Toporov \"  in Tolstoy's novel ''Resurrection''.) {{citation needed|date=October 2020}} Other conservative advisors included Count [[Dmitry Tolstoy|D. A. Tolstoy]] (minister of education, and later of internal affairs) and [[Ivan Durnovo|I. N. Durnovo]] (D. A. Tolstoy's successor in the latter post). [[Mikhail Katkov]] and other journalists supported the emperor in his autocracy.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} \n [[File:5 Roubles \u00e0 l'effigie du Tsar d'Alexandre III, 1888.jpg|thumb|5-ruble coin of Alexander III, 1888]] \n The [[Russian famine of 1891\u201392]], which caused 375,000 to 500,000 deaths, and the ensuing cholera epidemic permitted some liberal activity, as the Russian government could not cope with the crisis and had to allow zemstvos to help with relief (among others, [[Leo Tolstoy]] helped organize soup-kitchens, and [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] directed anti-cholera precautions in several villages).{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} \n \n Alexander's political ideal was a nation composed of a single nationality, language, and religion, all under one form of administration. Through the teaching of the [[Russification|Russian language in Russian schools in Germany, Poland, and Finland]], the destruction of the remnants of German, Polish, and Swedish institutions in the respective provinces, and the patronization of [[Eastern Orthodox]]y, he attempted to realize this ideal. < ref > {{cite encyclopedia |last=Florinsky |first=Michael T. |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Brittanica |title=Alexander III |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-III-emperor-of-Russia |access-date=5 September 2019 |date=6 March 2019 |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, inc.}} < /ref > \n \n Alexander was hostile to Jews; His reign witnessed a sharp deterioration in the Jews' economic, social, and political condition. His policy was eagerly implemented by tsarist officials in the  \" [[May Laws]] \"  of 1882.

Diplomat [[Nikolay Girs]], scion of a rich and powerful family, served as his Foreign Minister from 1882 to 1895 and established the peaceful policies for which Alexander has been given credit. {{citation needed|date=October 2020}} Girs was an architect of the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] of 1891, which was later expanded into the [[Triple Entente]] with the addition of Great Britain. That alliance brought France out of diplomatic isolation, and moved Russia from the German orbit to a coalition with France, one that was strongly supported by French financial assistance to Russia's economic modernization. {{citation needed|date=October 2020}} Girs was in charge of a diplomacy that featured numerous negotiated settlements, treaties and conventions. These agreements defined Russian boundaries and restored equilibrium to dangerously unstable situations. The most [[Panjdeh incident|dramatic success came in 1885]], settling [[The Great Game|long-standing tensions]] with Great Britain, which was fearful that Russian expansion to the South would be a threat to India. < ref > Raymond A.

However, in 1890, the expiration of the treaty coincided with the dismissal of Bismarck by the new German emperor, [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] (for whom the Tsar had an immense dislike), and the unwillingness of Wilhelm II's government to renew the treaty.

At first, the Tsesarevich was more Slavophile than the Russian government.{{how|date=October 2020}} However, his [[phlegmatic]] nature restrained him from many exaggerations, and any popular illusions he may have imbibed were dispelled by personal observation in [[Bulgaria]] where he commanded the left wing of the invading army. Never consulted on political questions, Alexander confined himself to military duties and fulfilled them in a conscientious and unobtrusive manner. After many mistakes and disappointments, the army reached [[Constantinople]] and the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] was signed, but much that had been obtained by that important document had to be sacrificed at the [[Congress of Berlin]].{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}} \n \n [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] failed to do what was expected of him by the Russian emperor.

In accordance with this conviction, he suggested that certain reforms should be introduced.{{sfn|Wallace|1911|p=562}} \n \n ===Trade and Industry=== \n \n Alexander III took initiatives to stimulate the development of trade and industry, as his father did before him. Russia's economy was still challenged by the Russian-Turkish war of 1877\u20131878, which created a deficit, so he imposed customs duties on imported goods. To further alleviate the budget deficit, he implemented increased frugality and accounting in state finances. Industrial development increased during his reign. < ref > {{cite web |url=https://russia.rin.ru/guides_e/7022.html |title=The Economical Policy of Alexander III |access-date=14 August 2020}} < /ref >  Also during his reign, construction of the Trans Siberian Railway was started. < ref > {{cite web |title=The Trans-Siberian Railway |url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/months-past/trans-siberian-railway |website=History Today}} < /ref > \n \n === Family life === \n [[File:Tzar Alexander III and members of the Royal family.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left to Right: Emperor Alexander III, Prince George (later [[George V|George V of the United Kingdom]]), [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Marie Feodorovna]], [[Princess Maria of Greece and Denmark|Maria of Greece]], Tsesarevich Nicholas (later Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia]]). Probably taken on the imperial yacht near Denmark, {{c.}} 1893.]] \n \n Following his father's assassination, Alexander III was advised that it would be difficult for him to be kept safe at the [[Winter Palace]]. As a result, Alexander relocated his family to the [[Gatchina Palace]], located {{convert|20|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} south of [[St. Petersburg|St. Petersburg.]] The palace was surrounded by moats, watch towers, and trenches, and soldiers were on guard night and day. < ref > Carolly Erickson, Alexandra: The Last Tsarina, p. 19 < /ref >  Under heavy guard, he would make occasional visits into St. Petersburg, but even then he would stay in the [[Anichkov Palace]], as opposed to the Winter Palace.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Alexander resented having to take refuge at Gatchina.

Dismayed to learn that Prince Wittgenstein had proposed to her in early 1866, he told his parents that he was prepared to give up his rights of succession in order to marry his beloved  \" Dusenka \" . On 19 May 1866, Alexander II informed his son that Russia had come to an agreement with the parents of Princess Dagmar of Denmark, the fianc\u00e9e of his late elder brother Nicholas. Initially, Alexander refused to travel to Copenhagen because he wanted to marry Maria. Enraged, Alexander II ordered him to go straight to Denmark and propose to Princess Dagmar. Alexander wrote in his diary  \" Farewell, dear Dusenka. \" \n \n Despite his initial reluctance, Alexander grew fond of Dagmar. By the end of his life, they loved each other deeply. A few weeks after their wedding, he wrote in his diary:  \" God grant that... I may love my darling wife more and more... I often feel that I am not worthy of her, but even if this was true, I will do my best to be. \" < ref > Julia P. Gelardi, From Splendor to Revolution, p.29 < /ref >  When she left his side, he missed her bitterly and complained:  \" My sweet darling Minny, for five years we've never been apart and Gatchina is empty and sad without you. \" < ref > Simon Sebag Montefiore, The Romanovs, p. 459 < /ref >  In 1885, he commissioned [[Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9]] to produce the first of what were to become a series of jeweled Easter eggs (now called  \" [[Faberg\u00e9 egg]]s \" ) for her as an Easter gift. Dagmar was so delighted by the First Hen egg that Alexander gave her an egg every year as an Easter tradition. After Alexander died, his heir Nicholas continued the tradition and commissioned two eggs, one for his wife, Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, and one for his mother, Dagmar, every Easter. When she nursed him in his final illness, Alexander told Dagmar,  \" Even before my death, I have got to known an angel. \" < ref > The Romanovs, p. 483 < /ref >  He died in Dagmar's arms, and his daughter Olga noted that  \" my mother still held him in her arms \"  long after he died. < ref > The Romanovs, p. 484 < /ref > \n \n Alexander had six children by Dagmar, five of whom survived into adulthood: [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas]] (b. 1868), [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|George]] (b. 1871), [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]] (b. 1875), [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Michael]] (b. 1878) and [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Olga]] (b. 1882). He told Dagmar that  \" only with [our children] can I relax mentally, enjoy them and rejoice, looking at them. \" < ref > The Romanovs, p. 460 < /ref >  He wrote in his diary that he  \" was crying like a baby \" < ref > Miranda Carter, George, Nicholas, and Wilhelm: Three Royal Cousins and the Road to World War I, p. 54 < /ref >  when Dagmar gave birth to their first child, Nicholas.

Alexander enjoyed a more informal relationship with his youngest son Michael and doted on his youngest daughter, Olga. \n \n Alexander was concerned that his heir, Nicholas, was too gentle and naive to become an effective Emperor. When Witte suggested that Nicholas participate in the Trans-Siberian Committee, Alexander said, \u201cHave you ever tried to discuss anything of consequence with His Imperial Highness the Grand Duke?

These included Alexander II's blood-soaked uniform that he died wearing, and his reading glasses. < ref > Van Der Kiste, p. 118 < /ref > \n \n Even though he disliked their mother, Alexander was kind to his bastard half-siblings. His youngest bastard half-sister [[Catherine Yurievskaya|Princess Catherine Alexandrovna Yurievskaya]] remembered when he would play with her and her siblings:  \" The Emperor... seemed a playful and kind Goliath among all the romping children. \" < ref > Van Der Kiste, p. 119 < /ref > \n \n On {{OldStyleDate|29 October|1888|17 October}} the Imperial train [[derailment|derailed]] in an [[Borki train disaster|accident]] at [[Borki, Kharkiv Oblast|Borki]].

Both the horse and rider were sculpted in massive form, leading to the nickname of  \" hippopotamus \" . Troubetzkoy envisioned the statue as a [[caricature]], jesting that he wished  \" to portray an animal atop another animal \" , and it was quite controversial at the time, with many, including the members of the Imperial Family, opposed to the design, but it was approved because the [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Empress Dowager]] unexpectedly liked the monument.
