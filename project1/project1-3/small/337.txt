After a [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|revolution]] that deposed his mother [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] from the throne in 1868, Alfonso studied in [[Austria]] and [[France]]. His mother abdicated in his favour in 1870, and he returned to Spain as king in 1874 following a military coup against the [[First Spanish Republic|First Republic]]. Alfonso died aged 27 in 1885, and was succeeded by his son, [[Alfonso XIII]], who was born the following year. He is the most recent monarch of Spain to have died whilst on the throne. \n \n ==Political background, early life and paternity== \n Alfonso was born in [[Madrid]] as the eldest son of Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] on 28 November 1857. His official father, Isabella's husband [[Francisco de As\u00eds, Duke of C\u00e1diz|King Francisco de As\u00eds]], has been generally viewed as effeminate, impotent or homosexual, leading writers to question his biological paternity. There is speculation that Alfonso's biological father may have been Enrique Puigmolt\u00f3 y Mayans, a captain of the guard. < ref > Juan Sisinio P\u00e9rez Garz\u00f3n, Isabel II: Los Espejos de la Reina (2004) < /ref >  These rumours were used as political propaganda against Alfonso by the [[Carlists]], and he came to be widely nicknamed  \" Puigmoltejo \"  in reference to his supposed father. < ref > [[Jaime Ignacio del Burgo|Burgo Tajadura, Jaime Ignacio del]] (2008). ''Bolet\u00edn de la Real Academia de la Historia'', p. 242:  \" A few months later, on the night of November 28 at 10:15, the queen gave birth to a child, who in time would be Alfonso XII, to whom the tongues, more or less deridingly, gave the name of Puigmoltejo \" .

The supporters of the [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Count of Molina]] as king of Spain rose to have him enthroned. In addition, within the context of the post-Napoleonic restorations and revolutions which engulfed the West both in Europe and the Americas, both the Carlistas and the Isabelino conservatives were opposed to the new Napoleonic constitutional system. Much like in Britain, which subtracted itself from the liberal constitutional process, Spanish conservatives wanted to continue with the Traditional Spanish Organic Laws such as the [[Fuero Juzgo]], the Nov\u00edsima Recopilaci\u00f3n and the [[Siete Partidas|Partidas of Alfonso X]]. This led to the third cause of instability of note, the  \" Independence of the American Kingdoms \" , recognized between 1823 and 1850. \n \n ==A split nation== \n When Queen Isabella II and her husband were forced to leave Spain by the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Revolution of 1868]], Alfonso accompanied them to Paris. From there, he was sent to the [[Theresianum]] in [[Vienna]] to continue his studies. On 25 June 1870, he was recalled to Paris, where his mother abdicated in his favour, in the presence of a number of Spanish nobles who had tied their fortunes to those of the exiled queen. He assumed the name Alfonso XII, for although no king of united Spain had borne the name  \" Alfonso XI \" , the Spanish monarchy was regarded as continuous with the more ancient monarchy represented by the 11 kings of [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]], [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] also named [[Alfonso]]. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" > {{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso XII.|volume=1|page=736}} < /ref > \n \n ==The Republic== \n {{main|First Spanish Republic}} \n [[File:Alfonso XII con el duque de Sesto.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A young Alfonso with his mentor, the [[Jos\u00e9 Osorio y Silva|Duke of Sesto]]]] \n After the revolution, the ''Cortes'' decided to set up a new dynasty on the throne. [[Amadeo I of Spain|Prince Amadeo of Savoy]], the younger son of King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy]] and a distant cousin of Alfonso by common descent from [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], was recognized as King of Spain in November 1870. During a tumultuous reign, Amadeo was targeted by assassination attempts and struggled with opposition from both [[Carlism|Carlists]] and [[republicanism in Spain|republicans]] while his own faction split. After the Carlists revolted and the [[Third Carlist War]] broke out, he [[abdication|abdicated]] and returned to Italy in early 1873. < ref > {{cite web |title=AMEDEO Ferdinando Maria di Savoia, duca di Aosta, re di Spagna |url=https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/amedeo-ferdinando-maria-di-savoia-duca-di-aosta-re-di-spagna_%28Enciclopedia-Italiana%29/}} < /ref > \n \n Following Amadeo's abandonment, the [[First Spanish Republic]] was established, including the territories of [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the Pacific Archipelagos. The first act of President [[Estanislao Figueras]] was to extend the abolition of slavery to Puerto Rico; Cuban slaves would have to wait until 1889. The republicans were not in agreement either, and they had to contend with a [[Ten Years' War|war in Cuba]] and Muslim uprisings in [[Spanish Morocco]]. In the midst of these crises, the Carlist War continued and the Carlist party made itself strong in areas with claims over their national and institutional specificity such as [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. This unrest led to the creation of a group in favour of the [[Bourbon Restoration in Spain|Bourbon Restoration]], led by the moderate conservative [[Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo]].  \n \n Alfonso was well-educated and cultured, especially compared to his mother. His tutors took great care to have him educated in good schools and to familiarize him with different cultures, languages and government models throughout Europe. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Alfonso relocated from Paris to [[Geneva]] with his family, and then continued his studies at the [[Theresianum]] in [[Vienna]] in 1872. C\u00e1novas began to take responsibility for Alfonso's education with the goal of shaping him into the ideal king for the planned Bourbon Restoration, and next sent him to the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], in England. < ref name= \" rah \" > {{cite web |title=Alfonso XII |url=http://dbe.rah.es/biografias/6413/alfonso-xii|publisher=[[Real Academia de la Historia]]}} < /ref >  The training he received there was severe but more cosmopolitan than it would have been in Spain, given its atmosphere at the time. \n \n On 1 December 1874, Alfonso issued the Sandhurst Manifesto, where he set the ideological basis of the Bourbon Restoration. It was drafted in reply to a birthday greeting from his followers, a manifesto proclaiming himself the sole representative of the Spanish monarchy. At the end of 1874, Brigadier [[Arsenio Mart\u00ednez Campos|Mart\u00ednez Campos]], who had long been working more or less openly for the king, led some battalions of the central army to [[Sagunto]], rallied the troops sent against him to his own flag, and entered [[Valencia]] in the king's name. Thereupon the President resigned, and his power was transferred to the king's plenipotentiary and adviser, C\u00e1novas. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / >  The 29 December 1874 military coup of Gen. Martinez Campos in Sagunto ended the failed republic and meant the rise of the young Prince Alfonso. \n \n ==Return from exile== \n [[File:5 pesetas Alfonso XII - 1875.png|thumb|5 Peseta of Alfonso XII]] \n Within a few days after Canovas del Castillo took power as Premier, the new king, proclaimed on 29 December 1874, arrived at Madrid, passing through [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia]] and was acclaimed everywhere (1875). In 1876, a vigorous campaign against the [[Carlism|Carlists]], in which the young king took part, resulted in the defeat of [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Don Carlos]] and the Duke's abandonment of the struggle. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / > \n \n Initially led by Canovas del Castillo as moderate prime minister, what was thought at one time as a coup aimed at placing the military in the political-administrative positions of power, in reality ushered in a civilian regime that lasted until [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]]'s 1923 [[coup d'\u00e9tat]].  C\u00e1novas was the real architect of the new regime of the Restoration. \n [[File:Homburg Castle Monarchs.jpg|thumb|left|Alfonso surrounded by his relative European monarchs and their spouses at [[Homburg Castle]] in 1883. [[Edward VII]], [[Wilhelm I]] and [[Carlos I of Portugal|Carlos I]] can be seen amongst others]] \n In order to eliminate one of the problems of the reign of Isabel II, the single party and its destabilizing consequences, the Liberal Party was allowed to incorporate and participate in national politics, and the 'turnismo' or alternation was to become the new system. Turnismo would be endorsed in the Constitution of 1876 and the [[Pact of El Pardo|Pact of Pardo Palace]] (1885). It meant that liberal and conservative prime ministers would succeed each other ending thus the troubles. \n \n This led to the end of the Carlist revolts and the victory over the New York-backed Cuban revolutionaries, and led to a huge backing both by insular and peninsular Spaniards of Alfonso as a wise and able king. \n \n Alfonso's short reign established the foundations for the final socioeconomic recuperation of Spain after the 1808\u20131874 crisis. Both European (the coastal regions, such as the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Asturias) and Overseas \u2013 Antilles and Pacific were able to grow steadily. Cuba and Puerto Rico prospered to the point that Spain's first train was between Havana and Camag\u00fcey, and the first telegraph in Latin America was in Puerto Rico, established by [[Samuel Morse]], whose daughter lived there with her husband. Upon the American invasion of Puerto Rico, ten US dollars were needed to buy one Puerto Rican peso. \n \n ==First marriage== \n On 23 January 1878 at the Basilica of [[Basilica of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Atocha|Atocha]] in Madrid, Alfonso married his first cousin, Princess [[Mercedes of Orl\u00e9ans|Maria de las Mercedes]], but she died within six months of the marriage. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / > \n \n ==Second marriage and rule== \n [[File:FOTOGRAFIA DEL REY ALFONSO XII, LA REINA M. CRISTINA Y LA PRINCESA DE ASTURIAS (1880).jpg|thumb|right|King Alfonso XII and [[Maria Christina of Austria|Queen Maria Christina]] with their daughter [[Mercedes, Princess of Asturias|Mercedes]] in 1880]] \n On 29 November 1879 at the Basilica of Atocha in [[Madrid]], Alfonso married his double third cousin, Archduchess [[Maria Christina of Austria]]. During the honeymoon, a pastry cook named Otero fired at the young sovereign and his wife as they were driving in Madrid. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / > \n \n The children of this marriage were: \n * [[Mercedes, Princess of Asturias|Mar\u00eda de las Mercedes]], Princess of Asturias, (11 September 1880{{snd}}17 October 1904), married on 14 February 1901 to [[Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]], and titular heir from the death of her father until the posthumous birth of her brother \n * [[Infanta Mar\u00eda Teresa of Spain|Mar\u00eda Teresa]], (12 November 1882{{snd}}23 September 1912), married to [[Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria]] on 12 January 1906 \n * [[Alfonso XIII]] (17 May 1886{{snd}}28 February 1941). Born posthumously. He married [[Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] \n \n Alfonso had two sons by Elena Armanda Nicolasa Sanz y Mart\u00ednez de Arizala (15 December 1849, in [[Castell\u00f3n de la Plana]] \u2013 24 December 1898, in Paris): \n * Alfonso Sanz y Mart\u00ednez de Arizala (28 January 1880, in Madrid{{snd}}19 March 1970, in Paris), married in 1922 to Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe de Limantour y Mariscal \n * [[Fernando Sanz y Mart\u00ednez de Arizala]] (28 February 1881, in Madrid{{snd}}8 January 1925, in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France), unmarried and without issue \n \n In 1881 Alfonso refused to sanction a law by which the ministers were to remain in office for a fixed term of 18 months. Upon the consequent resignation of Canovas del Castillo, he summoned [[Pr\u00e1xedes Mateo Sagasta]], the Liberal leader, to form a new cabinet. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / > \n \n ==Death and impact== \n [[File:Muerte de Alfonso XII o el \u00daltimo Beso.jpg|thumb|right|''Death of Alfonso XII'' or ''The last kiss'', by {{ill|Juan Antonio Benlliure|es}}]] \n In November 1885, Alfonso died, just short of his 28th birthday, at the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo]] near Madrid. He had been suffering from [[tuberculosis]], but the immediate cause of his death was a recurrence of [[dysentery]]. < ref > \" Death of the King of Spain \" , ''[[The Times]]'' (26 November 1885): 7. < /ref > \n \n In 1902, his widow Maria Cristina initiated a national contest to build a [[Monument to Alfonso XII|monument in memory of Alfonso]]. The winning design, by [[Jos\u00e9 Grases Riera]], was erected in an artificial lake in Madrid's [[Parque del Buen Retiro]] in 1922. \n \n Coming to the throne at such an early age Alfonso had served no apprenticeship in the art of ruling. Benevolent and sympathetic in disposition, he won the affection of his people by fearlessly visiting districts ravaged by [[cholera]] or devastated by [[List of earthquakes in Spain|earthquake]] in 1885. His capacity for dealing with men was considerable, and he never allowed himself to become the instrument of any particular party. During his short reign, peace was established both at home and abroad, finances were well regulated, and the various administrative services were placed on a basis that afterwards enabled Spain to pass through the disastrous [[Spanish\u2013American War|war with the United States]] without the threat of a revolution. < ref name= \" EB1911 \" / > \n \n ==Honours== \n * {{flagicon image|Flag of Spain (1785\u20131873, 1875\u20131931).svg}} [[History of Spain (1810\u20131873)|Spain]]: [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Knight of the Golden Fleece]], ''1857'' < ref > {{cite web|url=http://www.antiquesatoz.com/sgfleece/knights6.htm |title=Chevaliers de la Tois\u00f3n d'Or \u2013 Knights of the Golden Fleece |last= Boettger|first=T.
